Zivame, an online store that wants torevolutionize the (often awkward) way that women in India buy their underwear,hasclosed a $40 million Series C round.The investment is led by new backersZodius Technology Fund and Khazanah Nasional Berhad,a fund belonging to the Malaysian government, with participation from existing investorsUnilazer, IDG Ventures and Kalaari Capital.The four-year-old company, which has now raised over $45 million in capital, said it will use the fresh money to growits business to India. In particular, CEO and co-founder Richa Kar said that the company will introduce physical experience stores  where women can be fitted and seek non-sales advice on their size  while theZivame service will move to incorporate community-based features to help its female shoppers trade recommendations, product opinions and more.Kar told TechCrunch that she and co-founder Kapil Karekar started Zivame to reimagine the lingerie industry and the difficulties within the buying experience in India.Womens bodiesare manydifferent shapes and sizes, and retailers often cant cover all body types. That means many women (who shop in stores) are forced to compromise on size, she said.Kar added that the physical retail experience is often difficult for women, who mayhaveto go to a store staffed by men to buy underwear, whilefew retailers offer the requisite fitting services to get a womans size, and thus the fit of herunderwear, right.Were helping Indian women feel a lot more respected, she said. [We aim to] absolutely liberate Indian women compared to the offline retail process.Zivame overcomes these issues by stocking a wide range of different sizes and types of underwear to ensure that theres something for every kind of woman. The companys websiteoffers simple guidelines and a video to help shoppers measure themselves, but its upcoming physical experience stores can offer an even more personal approach for thosewho are less certain, or unaware entirely, of online services.Ourexperience stores are aimed at enhancing the consumer connection, Kar explained. Customers can walk in and have a personalized experience to get their size, become aware of their bust shape, and know the kind of products that theycould buy. We wont be selling there, but visitorscan place an order if they wish.Zivame plans to have 100 of these locations operational across Indias top tier cities within the next two years. Kar said that the initial rollout will happen in Bangalore, but the company will take its time and not expand the programuntil it is fully satisfied with the experience that its offering.Other expansions  both geographically outside of India, and into other product categories  arent planned at this point.Kar told us that India will beZivames sole focus for at least the next two years. That said, she did admit that international expansions could be possible thereafter since the companys technology is scalable to other countries and locations.Beyond underwear and bras, the companysellsswimsuits, night wear, some sports gear and accessories, but any moveinto other verticals would need tofit with itscore goals, the Zivame CEO said.Wecould get into other product categories, but we are very focused on the fact that we are solving a problem [with lingerie]. Is there something else where the offline experience is bad, or there is a small vertical that needs expanding? [Were focused on] any categories that help women, Karexplained.More definite, however, is Zivames intention to grow a community of shoppers. The company already sells one bra per minute and 60 percent of sales are from its own-brand products, butKar said she wants to encourage women to discuss topics and share ideas. No particular features were disclosed, but the general trend  Kar explained  is to let women find and interact with others who share their size and body shape. Finding others with these things in common can be difficult in real life, andZivame believes its service can be of help here, too.Elsewhere, the company has just launched its first native app  on Android, the most popular platform in India  to focus in on the opportunity of mobile, which it claimed accounts for 60 percent of its traffic.The original version of this story incorrectly reported the round as $38 million, weve since updated with the correct figure.
