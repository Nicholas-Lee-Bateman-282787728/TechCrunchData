Google has bumped the storage limit for its locker service for Google Play Music from 20,000 to 50,000 songs, giving users more than double the capacity to store their own collection in the cloud, over and above the extensive streaming library that makes up Google Play Musics own category. The extended library allowance is a free upgrade for users, meaning people get the additional capacity without having to sign up for more Drive storage or anything like that.The bump in available space is easy to take advantage of, and applies automatically if youre already hosting your collection in Googles cloud.

The setup process at step 3 will instead guide you through installing Music Manager where you can still add 50,000 songs.While people are generally trending towards streaming services and away from downloaded digital files, according to most recent surveys and industry outlooks, theres still a huge chunk of users that have invested in building massive local storage libraries. Google offering to take even bigger chunks of these legacy collections to the cloud is even more likely to help bring customers unwilling to give up their previous musical life altogether into their camp for the next stage of musical evolution.
