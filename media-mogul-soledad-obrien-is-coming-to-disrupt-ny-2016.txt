Well-known broadcast journalist turned media production startup founder Soledad OBrien will join us on stage in just a few weeks at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC.OBrien is a powerhouse of a TV personality and has built a solid career over the last 25+ years as a television anchor, producer and correspondent for CNN, HBO, MSNBC, Al Jazeera America and many other prestigious outlets.On top of that, she has developed a growing roster of news networks through Starfish Media Group, her startup production company focusing on character-driven documentary style storytelling such as the series Black in America.OBrien founded Starfish Media Group in 2013 after leaving her post as the anchor of CNNs morning news program Starting Point.The Emmy award-winning anchor turned media mogul brings a rich background to storytelling as the daughter of Afro-Cuban and Australian immigrant parents and seeks out the untold and complex stories of diversity and social strife in America.She also runs the Starfish Foundation, a non-profit supporting the college education and mentorship of young women from disadvantaged environments.We will be chatting with OBrien about what it takes to run a media startup in this current digitally-driven environment and how she picks which subjects to focus on.OBrien joins a burgeoning list of Disrupt NY 2016 speakers, including actor and co-founder of The List B.J. Novak, The Honest Companys Jessica Alba, and Foursquares Dennis Crowley. This is the first time the show will be in Brooklyn and we hope you can join us. Tickets are available here.
