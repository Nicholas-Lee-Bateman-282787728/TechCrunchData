As the lights dimmed at the Rebecca Minkoff runway show at New York Fashion Week on Friday, a drone hovered above the band in thecenter of the runway.The drone, a Yuneec Typhoon quadcopter complete witha 3-axis precision video camera, followed overhead as each model strutted down the runway to capture aerial footage of the show (and the celebrities in attendance, of course).For those of you who arent up on your #fashion, Rebecca Minkoff is a designer womens accessories and apparel brand, known for its relatively affordableluxury handbags.Its not the first time weve seen drones on the runway. At Milan FashionWeek last year,Fendi used drones to capture alive streamof itsshow. And at the slightlyoxymoronicSilicon Valley Fashion Week in May, drones replaced living models altogether.For Rebecca Minkoff, however, the drones are a representation of the brands vision rather thanahigh-techgimmick to wow the crowd.We wanted to incorporate drone technology into the show because the millennial woman is probably going to have her own drone in the next couple of years, says Uri Minkoff, the brands co-founder and CEO.Minkoff is referring to gadgets likeNixie, the wearable drone startup that wonIntels Make It Wearable Challenge last year at CES.Obviously these things are still in prototype and we dont have them today, but in the next couple of years wellseethe selfie stick go away and maybe well all have personal drones, Minkoff says.On Friday, Rebecca Minkoffalso debuteda new lineof tech-enabled products, including iPhone wallets with built-in charging capability and the first designer collection of Apple Watch bands. And unlike most of the Spring 2016 fashion youll see on the runway this week, these productsare available now.Unlike the Hermes band, ours are available to ship this month, Minkoff says. Especially with the newest iPhone 6s coming out, women are wanting to buy their tech accessories now instead of waiting six months.Beyond tech-enabled iPhone wallets and handbags,Minkoff says the brand isexploring geolocation tech in larger handbags, wearable-integratedfabrics (especially with the launch of its new athletic apparel line), and virtual reality for both in-store and at-home shopping.A lot of tech partners are reaching out because were leading this revolution in womens wear, says Minkoff. Were the techie in the room.
