Some more consolidation underway in the world of enterprise cloud services, and specifically in the areaof hybrid cloud. Today Cisco announced that it is buyingCliQr, a provider of applicationmanagement solutions for hybrid cloud environments, for $260 million in cash and equity awards.The deal, which is expected to close in Q3 of this year, will see the CliQr team become a part of Ciscos Insieme business unit reporting to Prem Jain. CliQr was already working with Cisco, with the companys solutions integrated across several of Ciscos data center switching and cloud solutions, the company said.CliQr had raised just over $38 million from investors that include Google Ventures, Foundation Capital, InstantScale Ventures, Polaris Partners and Translink Capital. CliQr, based out of San Jose,was founded in 2010 but only came out of stealth in 2012.While many businesses today are moving services off their own servers and into cloud-based evironments, more often than not enterprises are taking a combined approach using on-premise, cloud and third-party servers to run their IT. This is leading to a lot of M&A activity in the hybrid cloud space but also companies organically expanding their service offerings in this field to meet customer demands.Customers today have to manage a massive number of complex and different applications across many clouds, said Rob Salvagno, vice president, Cisco Corporate Development, in a statement. With CliQr, Cisco will be able to help our customers realize the promise of the cloud and easily manage the lifecycle of their applications on any hybrid cloud environment.CliQrs approach, as Cisco describes it, is to provide customers with a single platform, called the CloudCenter,tomanage applications across hybrid IT environments. The idea with CliQr is that its meant to grow with the businesss own gradual move to the cloud by making it easy to move application by application into a cloud environment, making it an attractive upsell.Cisco says it will keep CliQr operational as it is today and integrate it further into itsdata center business.The is Ciscos 195th (!) acquisition.
