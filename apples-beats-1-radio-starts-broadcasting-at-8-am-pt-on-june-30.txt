Apple is set to begin broadcasting its Beats 1 24-hour live radio station at 8 AM PT on June 30, according to Apple Music Senior Director and former Beats Music CEOIan C. Rogers, who posted the following to Twitter today:Please join us at 8am Tuesday morning as we set this ship a sail: Zane Lowe, the D.J. (NYT) http://t.co/ycXatH5pmm ian c rogers (@iancr) June 25, 2015The debut of the streaming radio station, which is hosted by a trio of DJs led by former BBC tune jockey Zane Lowe, will feature content including interviews with the likes of Eminem, as well as shows hosted by and starring music industry icons like Drake, Pharrell and Elton John, to name just a few.The New York Times dove into some of the programming details, revealing that one- and two-hour programming blocks will flesh out the segments hosted by Lowe, along with Ebro Darden and Julie Adenuga.Beats 1 will likely arrive alongside Apple Music, and both will probably follow the official launch of iOS 8.4, which will provide the software underpinnings for both streaming services. Apple is offering a free trial of Apple Music to all users for the first three months, and is $9.99 per month after that. Beats 1 is available to all users signed in with an Apple ID, however, free of charge.
