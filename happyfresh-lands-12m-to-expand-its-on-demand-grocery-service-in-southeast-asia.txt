HappyFresh, the grocery delivery service that opened its doors in Southeast Asia earlier this year, has landeda $12 million Series A round to develop its service and further expand across the region.The startupoffers a one-hour delivery that borrows from establishedU.S. companies like Instacart.It works with physical retailersto sell their grocery products, but it uses its own shoppers and delivery teams to getthe goods from the shelves to a customers doorstep.Founded in October 2014, itis currently live in Jakarta, Indonesia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Bangkok, Thailand.HappyFreshpreviously closed a multi-million dollar seed round  the value of whichwas not fully disclosed  and its Series A comes from a list of reputable backers in Southeast Asia.Vertex Ventures, which is part of Singapores Temasek Holdings, and Sinar Mas Digital Ventures (SMDV), the fund associated with Indonesian retail giantSinar Mas Group, led the round.Asia Venture Group, BEENEXT, Ardent Capital, 500 Startups and Cherry Ventures also took part.Markus Bihler, HappyFreshs CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch in an interview that he was delighted to receive the backing of thestrongest, most resource-rich local investors who willhelp the company navigate Southeast Asia and its cultural diversity.What were building here is a pan-Southeast Asia food tech group with the ambition to define how people shop and interact with groceries more broadly than anext hour grocery service,Bihler said.Bihler, whose resume includes a stint withThe Boston Consulting Group, further explained that HappyFresh serves two distinct business: retailers, with which it partners to help them reach out online and via its mobile apps, and consumers, who appreciate the convenience of on-demand shopping.Were building a product for supermarket customers and end shoppers, we give it equal resources, he explained.HappyFresh is integrated into existing IT services and backend systems within retail partners,Bihler explained. Advancing the companys technology is one focus for the new capital. From the outside, fulfilling shopping order seems straightforward, HappyFreshs systems needs to load balance available goods with customer requests.Aside from the tech  which is somewhat reminiscent of the systems used by on-demand services like Uber, GrabTaxi and Lyft  HappyFresh blends people power. It uses professionally trained personal shoppers to select the right goods for its customers. That means the best bananas, highest qualitysteak or ripest tomato packs to fulfill orders. In cases where product is a store is deemed to fall short of the required standard,Bihler said HappyFresh will call a customer directly to make a decision on the item, rather than just taking the best of whats left.End-to-end quality control is essential, he explained. Asit represents a customers shopping.HappyFresh is working to make the shopping experience even easier and more convenient. Beyond one-click repurchases  which let customers re-order a previous shopping basket, because repeat orders are commonplace  it is focused on tailoring the experience to each user.Going forward, well use search and shopping patterns to learn about your preferences and further personalize your shopping experience and the offers to you,Bihler told us. That could mean surfacing coupons or offerings that fit with previous searches or orders.Indeed, that vast trove of data not only helps HappyFresh tailor its service, but it helps retailers themselves gain greater insight into their customers. Thats a real challenge forbrick and mortar companies.Wevedeveloping customer insight and data to make this a two-sided partnership,Bihler said, without revealing too much more information for now.Hes equally coy about how the service is doing at this point.Wereseeing very consistent 100 percent month-on-month growth in each city, which leads us to believe that theres real pent up demand for online grocery services, he said, declining to provide raw figures.How many users are coming back to the service consistently?Avery high proportion are return customers were seeing aconsistently high frequency of repurchasing,Bihler answered.Its still early days for the service, of course, so you can perhaps forgive the reluctance to divulge a fuller data set. One topic whereBihler speaks with more certainly is expansion plans for HappyFresh.We want to expand across Southeast Asia, he said. We just launched in Bangkok and we are in the process of coming toTaipei, Taiwan. We are also looking at new cities within existing countries and just opened upin Surabaya, Indonesia.Another area where the service is moving into is recipe ideas after it teased Happy Recipe a recipe platform which will integrate with HappyFresh core product.Bihler isnt saying too much about exactly what Happy Recipe will be, but the idea  he said  is to give customers recipe ideas fortheir shopping.We want to stayone step ahead [of the competition] by providing the inspiration for what to cook, the HappyFresh CEO said.
