Here at TechCrunch were eagerly awaiting the day when3D photographs are just as mainstream as traditional ones. We even have an ongoing collection of some TC writers modeled in 3D.However, like manyearly technologies,3D capture devices are mostly too expensive and complicated to cater to the masses.Canadiancompany Matter and Formis aiming to change this with Bevel, a devicethat plugs into your phones audio jack and allowsit to capture 3D photographs. The device is currently in the midst of a $200,000 Kickstarter campaign, and eventually will retail for $49.Beveluses an eye-safe laser that acts as a fixed light source to capture scale and geometric detail, while your phonescamera captures color, texture and other details.The result is a360-degree model that you can rotate, zoom and even 3D-print.Notably, the device and software will also work across a variety of phones and platforms, since itwill ship with a calibration card that will help itadjust forvarious phone sizes and headphone jack locations.Bevel will also come with a companion app, which will allow users tocapture and share these 3D models.While the company said these captured images will probably be saved in a proprietary format, the app will allow them to be exportable in common 3D formats so they can be printed or imported into other software.Matter and Form is also launching Cashew, which is the companys new (still in beta) online platform to upload and share 3D content.While Cashew issimilar to existing services like Sketchfab, users should benefit from the easy ability to upload to Cashew directly from the Bevel app. Cashew will alsoallow users to send models directly to 3D printing services like Shapeways.Matter and Formalready has experiencelaunching 3D hardware products. Last year, they launched a relativelyaffordable 3D scanner, which we took a look at in a hands-on review.Now, the company is bringing 3D scanning to the masses, with the very affordablypriced Bevel.The companys end goal is to allow users to create and consume 3D media without all of the BS that comes with traditional 3D software and programs. Drew Cox, founder and CEO of Matter and Form, emphasized that most hardware and software in the 3Decosystem was developed a long time ago, and isnt very intuitive.The devices are expected to ship late Q4/early Q1 2016 and can be preordered on Kickstarter now.
