Yello Mobile, the Korean company that gobbled up 61 companieslast year and recentlyraised $100 million, is always hungry for acquisitions, and its back at the table again after picking upGushcloud, a Singapore-based influencer marketing platform that operates across Southeast Asia.Both partiesdeclined to reveal a valuation for the deal, but they did tell TechCrunch that it is multi-million dollars and fora majority share of the company.In simple terms, Gushcloud is a service that allows companies and brands to tap into influencers on the internet; includingbloggers, YouTubers, vloggers, influential Twitter folk etc. It was the center ofcontroversy last year when Singapores most prominent blogger Xiaxue accused it ofa range of disingenuous activities, including inflated numbers, buying fake followers and makingits bloggers mask ads as genuine posts.Yello, which is valued at $1 billion based on that recent funding round, is a curious company and certainly not your average tech unicorn.It is perhaps best thought of as a holding companyfor a range of mobile services, although it does provide input and assistance across its network. Itsbusinesses span a range of verticals, includingmobile shopping and advertising, mobile travel, online-to-offline retail, andmobile media. Its CEO previously said itwill look to go public in 2016.So, what does Yello see inGushcloud?Its often hard to know for sure given itspenchant for acquiring seemingly any startup doing anything in mobile in Asia. But, Gushclouds focus does couple withYellos existing advertising and marketing business, which it claimshas over 5,000 clients from across five countries.Yello has made acquisitions in Southeast Asia before  including deals in Thailand and Indonesia  and opportunities in the regionare a key componentofthe deal, according to Gushcloud co-founderVincent Ha, whowill continue to lead the company in a new role within its parentsmarketing and advertising arm.Korean brands are taking Southeast Asia and the rest of the world by storm, dominating inmobile phones, household appliances, skincare, fashion, entertainment and pop culture.Gushcloud and its sister companies look forward to working with the many of these Koreanbrands to help them stand out from the clutter in the online world.Yello said it plans to acquire at least 20 more marketing companies across Asia this year, so expect to see more deals like this  it typicallycloaks its spending as undisclosed  in 2015.Its worth noting that theresa twist to how Yello integrates companies. It doesnt. Well, there is no requirement to be assimilated, at least.
