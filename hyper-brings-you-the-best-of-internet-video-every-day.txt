Hyper, a curated video discovery platform, is launching today to provideyou with a daily dose of the best short-form video content that the Internet has to offer.Powered by $1.1 million in seed funding from Advancit Capital, Lowercase Capital, Broadway Video Ventures, Freelands Ventures and Mesa Ventures, film producer Markus Gilles and cinematographer Jonas Brandau left Berlins independent film scene to build Hyper earlier this year.Were living in an Internet world where we have more awesome short-form video content than ever, but at the same time its harder and harder to find it amongst the trendy clickbait, says Gilles. That stuff bubbles up in our social media streams and algorithm-based recommendations because our friends have already fallen victim to it.Sure, YouTube can be useful for watching grizzly bears rolldown hills, but for those of us who are looking for something a bit more intellectually substantial, itcan take more time to hunt downshort-form videosthan it doesto actually watch them.To sift through theheaps of crappyvideo contentfor us,Hyper has employed a team of journalists and filmmakers whohand-select anywhere from six to a dozen videos each day and package theminto a visually appealing digital magazine of sorts.The videos range from one to twenty minutes in duration and span a broad variety of topics, from artsy foodie videosto emotionally drainingwar-zone documentaries.The goal, Gilles says, is to select videos that mostpeoplecan learn from and appreciate, even if the subject matter issomething they wouldnt typically be drawn to.Since the team doesnt post anything thats more than a couple of days old, the selection process relies heavily on personal taste instead of number of views or social sharing metrics.Sometimes the curation is much more obvious than you might think, Gilles says. Often we look back and see that these videos are the ones that performed extraordinarily well, way before an algorithm could detect that.Video content aggregation and curation is acrowded space, but Gilles believeshis teams film background and obsession overuser experiencegives Hyper an edge overexisting discovery tools within sites like Vimeo and YouTube. Considering that Hypers smalleditorial team drives much of the products value, however, the company will face the challenge ofmaintainingits voice and underground artistic appeal as it scales.Hyper is currently only available for iPad, but the company plans to roll out an iPhone version in the coming months.
