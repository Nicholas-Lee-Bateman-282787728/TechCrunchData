HTC is gearing up to launch something new on March 1 at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, and weve heard from a person familiar with the matterthat whats on tap is indeed the next version of the HTC One. The invites for a special event promising a glimpse of whats next (via The Verge), and bear the tagline Utopia in progress, whatever that means.HTC has done a great job of delivering quality devices with the past two HTC One flagship smartphones, including the M7 two years ago and 2014s M8. The M9 would be the logical next step from a naming/model number convention, so heres hoping they continue in the tradition of whats been working so well to date.The One line hasnt necessarily done a lot to light a fire under consumers, however, so perhaps well see the Taiwanese device maker take a different approach this time around. Either way, HTC is undeniably a critical favorite among Android makers so well be watching closely to see what happens next.
