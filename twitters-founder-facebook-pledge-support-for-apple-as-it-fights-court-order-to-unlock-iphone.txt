Those who seek to praise, promote, or plan terrorist acts have no place on our services. We also appreciate the difficult and essential work of law enforcement to keep people safe. When we receive lawful requests from these authorities we comply. However, we will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems. These demands would create a chilling precedent and obstruct companies efforts to secure their products.The American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation have also issued formal statements of support for Apples stance.Apple has until February 26 to respond to the court order, which calls for it to create a special version of iOS that would help unlock an iPhone used by shooterSyed Rizwan Farook.
