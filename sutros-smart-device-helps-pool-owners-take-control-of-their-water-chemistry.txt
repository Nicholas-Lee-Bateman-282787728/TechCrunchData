Sutro, a startup presenting at TechCrunchs Hardware Battlefield in Las Vegas, is aiming to remove one of the big headaches of owning a backyard swimming pool or spa.Now, I dont have a pool myself (weird, I know), but co-founders Ravi Kurani and Amanda Nagai told me that owners are expected to constantly check and adjust the chlorine and pH levels of their pool  otherwise they could end up with water that has a nasty chlorine smell, burns their eyes, or ruins the lining of their pool.Not only are those checkups an annoying thing to worry about (Nagai compared it to having a third or fourth child), but Kurani said that testing the water and measuring the added chemicals presents plenty of opportunities to make mistakes.Sutros Internet-connected device should make that process a lot simpler. It measures the chemical makeup of your pool and allows you to monitor the results from your smartphone. Plus, you can sign up for a weekly subscription that looks at the data and delivers the exact mix of chemicals you need.While theres a wave of Internet-connected home devices, Kurani argued that since its part of the connected backyard, Sutro has had to solve extra problems, like unpredictable weather and weak or nonexistent WiFi signal.Even beyond the device itself, the Sutro model seems particularly ambitious. And complicated.Were hardware meets mobile web meets service, in a sense, Kurani said. He argued that its not enough to just tackle pool testing  if its going to work for pool owners, Sutro needs to provide an all-encompassing solution.Kurani also noted that his father actually owned a number of pool and spa stores, so he spent his childhood kind of growing up in the industry. He said he never wanted to join the pool industry, but after working in sustainable investing and founding ImpactSpace, a database for impact investing (he worked on it with Nagai), Kurani decided that there was an opportunity to bring a startup approach to the market.The company is part of the Bolt.io hardware accelerator  in fact its Bolt.ios first company in San Francisco. The product is currently in testing with a few alpha users around the San Francisco Bay Area. You can sign up for the alpha here, which will give you a 50 percent discount on the retail price of $399.
