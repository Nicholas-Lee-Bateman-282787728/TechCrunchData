Google has partnered with the Constitute Project to surface, analyze and compare key passages in the US Constitution, as well as the constitutions of Afghanistan, Bhutan, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Laos, Latvia, Micronesia, Norway and Ukraine.As someone who was watching the debates last night and googling the constitution, I can report that Ill use this particular feature in the future. Simply type constitution into Google and youll see a special interface pop up at the top with the U.S. Constitution preamble, also letting you porethrough different sections.The company says that tying this information together helps Googles mission of returning a more perfect search.Happy Constitution day!
