Streaming services showed up in force for Sunday nights 73rd Golden Globe Awards, but it was Amazons year to shine. Though Netflix had led the pack this year with a total of eight nominations  even beating out HBO  the streaming service didnt take home the top prize in any of the categories it competed in.Instead, it was Amazon that was tonights winner among streamers.The now well-established competitor was effectively battling against itself this year, having received five nominations, including nods for Mozart in the Jungle along with last years winner Transparent  the latter which hadwon before for Best TV Series: Musical or Comedy. In addition, Transparents Jeffrey Tambor won Best Actor in a Comedy at the 2015 event.However, the Golden Globes like to shower the newcomers, so this time around, Amazons Mozart in the Jungle stolethe crown away from Transparent for both Best Comedy, and for Best Actor in a TV Comedy (Gael Garcia Bernal).Amazons lesser-knownshowwas certainly something of an underdogin the Best TV Comedy category, where it beat out popular programsfrom HBO, Hulu and Netflix.That being said, Netflix made an impact this year simply by having so many of its shows and those programs actors up for consideration, with noms for Orange is the New Black (2), Narcos (2), House of Cards (1), Master of None (1), Bloodline (1), and Grace and Frankie (1).Netflix, as these nominations indicate, is the new network TV.The service also made news for being the first streamer to earn a nomination for a feature film with Idris Elbas nod  though not a win  for Best Supporting Actor in the movie Beasts of No Nation. (He lost to Sylvester Stallone in Creed.) The film notably was also Netflixs first foray into feature-length projects.Above: Netflixs Beasts of No NationHulu made its mark this year, too  not by the total number of nominations, clearly, but for getting on the ballot for the first time with its single nod for Casual, which lost Best TV Comedy early on in the evening to Mozart in the Jungle.Meanwhile, HBO  something of a streamer itself thanks to HBO NOW  earned several nominations this year for its shows Game of Thrones, Veep, and Silicon Valley. However, it lost the Best TV Comedy title to Amazon, and its Games of Thrones lost Best TV Drama to USAs breakout hit Mr. Robot.Though the streaming services obviously didnt walk away with trophies for every category they competed in, they did easily shut out traditional TV broadcasters like ABC, FOX and PBS, each which only saw four nominations, and CBS, which had only been nominated one time. And with Netflix now moving into films, too, future Golden Globes may see further shake ups from the streaming industry.Image credits: GoldenGlobes.com; Amazon
