iPrice, the e-commercestartup that wants to be the gateway to online retail in Southeast Asia,is back in the money after raising$1.2 million.Asia Venture Group (AVG)  which financed the companys previous $550,000 raise  led the round, which also saw participation from 500 Startups 500 Durians fund for Southeast Asia, IMJ, Venturra, F2 Capital andStarstrike Ventures.Thats not quite all. iPrice, which makes its money sending traffic to e-commerce services and helping consumers pick through a multitude ofservices in seven countries,has also hired a new CEO.David Chmelar, who was previously with the Boston Consulting Group and most recently was a board member atWuestenrot Bank in the Czech Republic, has taken the hot seat.Heinrich Wendel, the former Microsoft Seattle product manager who wasthe founding CEO, is moving to a more hands-on role.Heinrich is still here and is absolutely a key person, but now that we are 70 [staff]  and [will] soon [be] close to 100  it requires additionalmanagement capacity so thatHeinrich can ensure sufficientfocus on the product,Chmelar told TechCrunch in an interview.Chmelar, who said he was looking for a challenge in a growth marketfollowing time spent in Europe and Canada, explained that the company is moving into new areas. Beyond its website, which is designed to help visitors find the best prices for products across multiple online retail sites, iPrice is also working with publishers to offer coupons.Its coupon program is being run witha selection of partners that includes Says.com in Malaysia and news site Rappler in the Philippines. Those publishers are using coupon pages  which are whitelabelled from iPrice  to offer e-commerce services to their readers.iPrice-powered coupons on Says.comThat experience,Chmelar said, is designed to be about product discovery, whereas the main siteis about providing an almost directory-like experience for finding specific items. In both cases, iPrice takes a cut of any sales generated by visitors clicking its links, but it shares those fees with publishers.Chmelar declined to disclose the specifics of iPrices monetization and its revenue sharing agreement with partners.In addition to hiring across the board Chmelar said the iPrice headcount could double over the next year  the company is also working to improve its mobile web design. While mobileaccounts for more than half of iPrices traffic, theres no plan to produce standalone mobile apps. Thats becausepeople are still searching for products on google [and iPrice] transfers traffic to merchants, many of which dont have an app,Chmelar explained.iPrice claims to offer 15 million products from over 150 direct partners. Thats up from three million products when we spoke toWendel when the company raised its first funding back in May.Chmelar told TechCrunch that he wants to see the current numbers doubled during the next quarter.Weve been getting great traction and have built a very solid base and good base number of merchants, he added. By mastering our mobile presence, iPricecan truly become the consumer brand for online shopping that we envision it to be.
