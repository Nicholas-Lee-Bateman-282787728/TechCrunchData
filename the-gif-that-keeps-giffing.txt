Twitter wants you to share more GIFs, thats why the company is testing a new GIF button inside its mobile app.Some lucky users are seeing a button that appears between the camera and poll icons inside theTwitter for Android app. We havent managed to replicate this ourselves here at TechCrunch (on Android or iOS) but one user Phil Pearlman  told us that pushing the button lets you select trending GIFs, or click through to choose based on mood categories. Thats much like the dedicated GIF button inside Facebook Messenger, which pulls up content from Riffsy and Giphy. But at this point, we dont know which partner/partners Twitter is working with.Pearlman posted a screenshot of what he saw but, right after doing so, the button mysteriously disappeared from his app before he was able to provide us with screenshots. (Hes not the only one who lost it.)If people aren't seeing it yet twttr is testing way cool gif feature. cc @bluechoochoo pic.twitter.com/LuTsVeUiSs Phil Pearlman (@ppearlman) February 4, 2016Twitter often conducts tests of new features and changes among small userbases, so theres nothing new here.When we reached out to the company for comment, though, it provided us with the following response.Ha ha, we see what you did there, Twitter, Pearlman isnt alone in seeing the button, plenty of other users are tweeting about it, and unsurprisingly  their tweets include GIFs, such as:New gif button on Twitter pic.twitter.com/GySgnQdogX TWD ~ RT or FAV (@WalkerBait_TWD_) February 4, 2016Twitter has a gif button pic.twitter.com/fDxWhKAPrT |CG| ArmoredDeath (@ArmoredDeath) February 4, 2016A gif button? Congratulations @twitter pic.twitter.com/zQADagAMSV Lee Carruthers (@Skooshbag) February 4, 2016WAIT WHEN DID THE GIF BUTTON ON HERE BECOME A THING pic.twitter.com/EPbis87b49 Lex (@Lexiilu22) February 4, 2016I guess thats what you calla promising early rollout  lets see if/when the button becomes an official feature for all users.At this point GIFs might just be a bit of fun and an opportunity to brighten up tweets, but there maybe commercial value to them in the future. Messaging app Kik just launched its first branded GIFs, and, with Twitter already monetizing emojisto the (reported) tune of $1 million a pop per brand, it seems plausible that GIFs could becomea money-maker, too.
