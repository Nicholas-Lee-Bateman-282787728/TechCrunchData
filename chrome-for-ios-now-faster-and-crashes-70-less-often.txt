Google is launching a new version of Chrome for iOStoday that promises to be both faster and more stable than previous versions.According to Google, Chrome 48 for iOS now crashes seventy percent less often and the browser should feel more responsive. JavaScript execution is also nowsignificantly faster.Until today, Google still used Apples UIWebKit framework. While that allowed apps to render web pages (which is essentially what Google did), it wassandboxed (for security reasons) andJavaScript performance especially suffered under this model.Now, Google has switched to WKWebView, which Apple introduced with iOS 8. Its been a while since iOS 8 was state of the art, but Google notes that migrating to WKWebView brought significant challenges. Specifically, Google notes thatthe new framework didntfeature an obvious way to manage cookies and form and SSL handling was also problematic. iOS 9 fixed some of these issues and now the team is ready to make the switch official.Thanks to moving to the new framework, the browserisnt just faster, but also more stable  and even when a page crashes, the app itself now doesnt crash anymore. Instead, it will simply display an error page, just like on the desktop.While having the browser crash less often is great, it alsonow features faster JavaScript speeds. Switching between pages now also causes fewer reloads. Google also says scrolling should now be faster and more responsive.
