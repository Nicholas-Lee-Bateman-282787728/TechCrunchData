Obvious Ventures, the venture capital firm started by Twitter and Medium co-founder Ev Williams, has raised a total of $77.7 million for its inaugural fund, Obvious Ventures I, according to a regulatory document filed today.Obvious Ventures, which counts longtime tech entrepreneur James Joaquin and executive-turned-investor Vishal Vasishth as co-founders, was unveiled in December 2014 with the aim of investing in startups that could have a sustainable positive impact on the world.(And if youre getting the sense that history is repeating itself here, it kind of is  Obvious Ventures is the third entrepreneurial effort from Ev Williams with the word obvious in its name. If it aint broke, etc.)As my colleague Ryan Lawler wrote a few months ago at the firms official launch, Obvious Ventures is focusing on funding startups across three main themes: sustainable systems such as technologies for conserving and maximizing natural resources; people power such as personal development and productivity software; and healthy living such as consumer-oriented fitness and well-being apps.Obvious has already disclosed investments in a number of companies, including plant-based protein food company Beyond Meat, energy-efficiency startup Flux, augmented reality company Magic Leap, and next-generation HR software firm ZenPayroll, to name a few.Ive emailed Ev Williams for more details on Obvious Ventures future plans in light of the filing, and will be sure to report back with anything additional info I receive.
