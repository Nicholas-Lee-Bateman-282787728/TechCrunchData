This thing somehow sticks to an HDTV. Called the Lenovo Cast, its the firms first media streaming device and is designed to work with Android devices. Launching this August at $49 and lacking native apps, its a more expensive Chromecast, but dont write off Lenovos product just yet.Lenovo has a massive footprint in several key markets including its home of China. A device like this should sell well to its loyal buyers. Plus with dual frequency WiFi it could work better than the stark Chromecast.The device either sits in a dock attached to the back of the HDTV or sits nearby. It connects to a TV via HDMI and yet still requires power from a microUSB port.The Lenovo Cast works with DLNA and Miracast-enabled devices, which are most mainstream Android devices. Lenovo says it has a range of 20 feet and is capable of receiving video and picture content as well as mirroring a smartphone display.
