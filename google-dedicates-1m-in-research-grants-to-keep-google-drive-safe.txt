Google wants you to feel safe and comfy in storing your data with them on all of their properties. One particular product probably has your most important documents  Google Drive.Today, the company announced that it will be dedicating one million dollars next year to fund grants for independent security research.Heres what the team said today:Our research grant program is one way independent security researchers contribute to Googles data security. Were grateful for their efforts to keep Google Drive safe, so next year were dedicating $1,000,000 to fund even more grants for independent security research. Separately, well continue to offer up to $20,000 to anyone who finds and reports a qualifying issue. The end result of these ongoing efforts is a product that  unlike your garden-variety hard drive  actually gets better over time.The company said that it currently has over 500 security experts in-house, but independent researchers can poke holes that they cant get to. Google knows that every cloud storage company is one security breach away from getting left in the dust, so this type of dedication isnt surprising.
