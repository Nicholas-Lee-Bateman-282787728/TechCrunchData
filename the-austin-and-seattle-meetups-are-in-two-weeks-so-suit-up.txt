You dont really need to put on a suit, but you do need to hurry. Tickets are selling out quick and I dont want you to miss out.TechCrunch is headed to Austin and Seattle and the pitch-off applications are closed, which means that there is one thing left for you to do: Buy tickets.Well hit up Austin on June 23 and head to our usual spot, Palm Door on Sixth Street, at 6pm sharp. Well hang for about an hour, have a drink or two (21+ only please), and then get underway with the pitch-off, where about ten companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product to a panel of local VC judges and a live audience.It will be a night of adventure, tension, and general merriment.Then, well head to Seattle on June 25 to visit the glorious Showbox SoDo. Same story: Arrive at 6pm, start the show around 7pm, choose a winner by 8pm and were out the door by 10pm.Last year, Seattle was feisty and fun. We expect nothing less this year.So whats the call?
