TechCrunch is hitting up Boston and Atlanta in February and were looking for the best and brightest new startups to pitch their products on our stage.The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off is an opportunity for us to hang out with startups that arent from Silicon Valley, and as we do every year, were starting with Boston and Atlanta.Ten startups will be selected to hop up on stage and pitch their wares in sixty seconds or less. A panel of expert VC judges will conduct a quick Q&A after every pitch, and at the end theyll determine who wins.First place gets a table in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt NY in May, along with two tickets to the conference. Second place will get two tickets to the show, and the Audience Choice winner will walk away with one ticket.After the pitch-off, well hang out and throw back a few drinks (21+ only, please), chit-chat, and enjoy each others company.Itll surely be a night to remember, but before we get too excited we need the brilliant entrepreneurs of Boston and Atlanta to apply to pitch.Applications close on February 11, so dont tarry if you want to participate.You can apply here.If you simply want to attend the events, you can buy tickets for Boston (February 23) here and Atlanta (February 25) here.Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
