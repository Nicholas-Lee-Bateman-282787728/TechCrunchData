I actually dont love computers in general. Ironic given that I build them professionally.

Im really thankful for touch technology and the iPhone  so much better!8) What gadget do you most depend on (besides a Nest product)?
My Audis self driving features. I commute for about 2-3 hours a day, adaptive cruise control is the best thing since sliced bread.9) What do you consider as your biggest missed opportunity in life?
Ive never really taken any time off since college. I really regret not taking a few months before starting Nest to relax and explore the world.10) Who was your most influential teacher?

LGs 4k OLED TV. Im a sucker for the spec wars and who cares if theres no content yet!12) When are you most likely to ignore an email?
