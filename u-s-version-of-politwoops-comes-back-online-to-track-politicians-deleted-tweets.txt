Politwoops, aservice thattracks politicians deleted tweets in an effort to hold elected officials accountable for the statements they make on social media, is nowback online in the U.S. The restoration of the service, announced todayby the Sunlight Foundation, follows Twitters earlier decision to restore Politwoops access to its API after previously having blocked it.The decision to shut off Politwoops was a controversial one. Twitter argued  mistakenly, according to the transparency organizations behind the service  that all Twitter users had aright to express themselves without fear that their tweets wereto become permanent record.Of course, that viewpoint doesnt quite match up with how statements made public figures in the political arena are usually treated  they are, in fact, generally held up to scrutiny by the media, fellow politicians, and their constituents.The code that allows Politwoops to operate was originally developed by Dutch organization the Open State Foundation over three years ago. The group shared the code with theSunlight Foundation, asimilar government transparency organization in the U.S. Both groups ran versions of Politwoops in their respective regions  Open State tracked politicians and diplomats tweets in dozens of countries, while the Sunlight Foundation was focused on the American political systems participants instead.Twitters decision to ban the services from using its API was quicklymet with outcry from seventeen international human rights and transparency groups, including not only the Sunlight Foundation and Open State Foundation, but also EFF, Free Press, Human Rights Watch and others.AfterTwitter co-founderJack Dorsey took the reigns, he hinted that Twitter may reverse its earlier decision.We have a responsibility to continue to power organizations who want to bring transparency like Politwoops, he said at the companys developer conference last fall.In December, Twitter then officially announced itwould restore Politwoops access to its API.Last month, the versions of the app run by the Open State Foundation came back online along with promises that the U.S. version would be live in a matter of weeks.Today the Sunlight Foundation confirms that its tool isalso now live again, too  just in time for theNew Hampshire primary.In addition to relaunch, the organization notes that it has made some changes to the service as well. It now shows every deleted tweet made byelected officials and candidates for office  not just those it thinks are important.And the service will soon be expanding its reach, too. According to an announcement from the Sunlight Foundation posted to its blog, the service today includes Senate, House and presidential candidates and officials and governors. But it wants to roll out its tweet-tracking toexecutive branch officials and state legislators in the future.Its also planning to introduce a filtering option based on the timing between the tweet and deletion, to help weed out simple errors and typos, the post additionally said.Politwoops is about providing another layer of accountability in our politics, said Sunlight Communications Director Jenn Topper. As 2016 is heating up, we are excited to have Politwoops back online and tracking deleted tweets from our public officials.
