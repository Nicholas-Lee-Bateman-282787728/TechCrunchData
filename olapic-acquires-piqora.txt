Two visual marketing startups are teaming up Olapicis announcing that it has acquiredPiqora.Both companies promise to help businesses promote themselves through user-generated photos, but Olapic co-founder and CEO Pau Sabria said his companys strength has been on Instagram (which was its initial focus), while Piqoras has been on Pinterest (ditto). So he sees the organizations as very complementary, while also praising Piqoras technology and its relationship with Pinterest.The plan is to integrate Piqoras main products  including its content scheduling tools, its analyticstools and its Instagram shopping product Tapshop  into the Olapic platform, where they will likely be rebranded.The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Piqora has raised more than $11 million in funding from investors, including Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Freestyle Capital and Baseline Ventures. New York-basedOlapic says it willfold Piqoras San Mateo, Calif. team into its own operations, although its not saying how many team members specifically are joining.As for Sabria, he predicted that the need for Olapics platform will only grow.Whether its seen on Pinterest, powers an ad or shows up on a website, what you will see more and more, thanks to Olapic,is that content generated by users is helping brands be much more symbiotic with their consumers, he said.
