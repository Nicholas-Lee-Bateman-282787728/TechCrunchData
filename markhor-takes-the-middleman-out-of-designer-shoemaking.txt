Markhor founder Waqas Ali spent the first half of his life without ever using the Internet. He grew up in a small village in Pakistan, and recalls usingGoogle for the first time in 2007 afterhe moved to Lahore to attend college.When Alireturned home to Okara for summer break, hewas inspired to start Markhor whiletalking to a local shoemaker about Facebook. The manhad heard that Facebook was a hateful, anti-Islam website, and Ali tried to explain the purposeofa social network bytelling theshoemakerthat he could even use Facebook to sellhis shoes to people around the world.Ali took his own advice, and turned the offhand suggestion into a legitimate business.In September of last year, Markhor launched a Kickstarter that brought in over $107,000 from 508 backers in two months.Shortly after, Ali and his co-founder Sidra Qasim became the first Pakistani company to beaccepted into Y Combinator as a part of the Summer 2015 class. The idea is that these craftsmen in Pakistan make handmade shoes for many luxury brands, but most of the money goes to these middlemen who are responsible for delivery, Ali says.By designing their own shoes, purchasing the leather themselves, and selling direct-to-consumer online, Markhor is able to pay their craftsmen three to five times more than the going rate. Many of these shoemakers live off less than $5 per day, Ali says, even though your average pair of Louis Vuitton mensloafersretails for around$1,000.For consumers, removing the middlemantranslates tohandmade, designer-quality shoes that cost less than$300 and ship within five days.When you purchase a pair of Markhor shoes, you are immediately looped into the production, and you receive periodic updates about the craftsmans progress.When the shoes arrive, includedin the boxis a profile of the craftsman responsible, Ali says, whichalso tells youhow much he makes.People like to know that these shoes are not made by a child or a pregnant woman in China, says Ali. When youre buying high-end shoes from big brands, there are so many layers that you dont know where the shoes are made.Ali says that Markhor is currently working with 75 craftsmen in Pakistan, and plans to scale up as needed.There are thousands of craftsmen like this in Pakistan, and if you include India and Africa, where we plan to expand our production, there are millions, he says.Markhor will be launching a womens line next month, again on Kickstarter, and will consider introducing additional products in the future.
