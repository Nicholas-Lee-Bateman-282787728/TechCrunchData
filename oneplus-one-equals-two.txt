Rookie smartphone company OnePlus hasremoved theneed for an invite to buyits One smartphoneandannounced a date for itsfollow-up device.The $299Onewhich we found to begreat value for moneylaunched a year ago but, until today, customers needed aninvite in order tobuy it. (Aside forsome exceptions here and there.)That wasa strategy toboth help manage the levelof interest in a new product from a new company, and generate a little more attention among the tech community.We now feel confident that we have matured enough to handle the increased complexity that comes along with opening up sales completely, OnePlus said in a blog post, which acknowledged ithad learned an immeasurable amount during its first year of business.One of those important lessons will include running sexist competitions to sell smartphones that doesnt work at all.Details of that incredibly stupid gaffe  if you can chalk a planned marketing campaign up to an errorof judgement werent included in the blog post, but theincidentsoured the OnePlus brandfor a lot of people.OnePlus also picked today to confirmthat its new device  the OnePlus 2  will launch in the third quarter of this year. That devicewill only be available via an invite, so the companyisnt discardingits sales restrictions forever.China-based OnePlusis one of a clutch of new hardware firms emerging in the sub-$300 smartphone niche. Xiaomi, which sold 60 million phones last year,is the most prominent example, but others include Le TV, and Smartisan. OnePlus sold a relatively modest one million devices in its first year, but it seemed to capture attention beyond China and has developed its own unique software for those reasons,its follow-up smartphoneis worthy of note.
