NASA took the wraps off a new website on Monday dedicated to tracking global changes in the sea level. Its packed full of free online resources that will likely be useful to teachers, the climate-change-curious, and anyone just looking to dig into publicly available data.The Sea Level Change site is NASA instead of NOAA because the site focuses on space-based observations  though the latter agencys mark is all over the place as well. There are sections on the history of observing sea level, ice reach, and other climate markers that make for good primers if youre not up on your oceanography.Theres also a database of published papers backing up the info on the site  some of which are free to read, but youll have to pick through to find out. (Note to NASA: love the site, but an indicator for open access articles would be great.)The landing page also apprises you of the latest depressing statistics: sea level rising 3.4 millimeters annually, for instance, or Greenland shrinking by 287 gigatons every year. Great job, everybody!
