Amazon Web Services, the enterprise division of the e-commerce and cloud services giant, has been growing its reach in data warehousing and big data analytics by way ofRedshift, a hosted product that it launched in 2012and is now AWSs fastest growing product ever, according to CTO Werner Vogels.Along with input fromAWSsown in-house engineering teams, it turns out that at least some of the products developmentcame by way of an acquisition.In May of last year, Amazon quietly acquired Amiato, a startup that builta platform to extract unstructured data from NoSQL databases and migrate it toRedshift, creating structure so that it could be analysed with Amiatos technology or other business intelligence tools.Apossible acquisition was first reported earlier this month by Bloomberg. While weve been waiting for both Amazon and Amiatos former CEO and co-founder Mehul Shah, along with several other people we have contacted to come back to us with a direct confirmation, weve found the evidence toprove it.One of Amiatos investors, Signatures Capital, lists Amiato as asuccessful exit. Acquired by Amazon May 2014, it notes.And several (but not all) of Amiatos former employees now list themselves as working at Amazon or AWS (here, here, here,hereand here).Amiatos Twitter account, meanwhile, hasnot been updated since 2013, although there is no indication on the site that it the service is no longer operating.Amiato  which was incubated under another name, Nou Data, at Y Combinator in 2012  had raised $2 million, with other investors includingBobby Yazdani,Data Collective,Andreessen Horowitz andIgnition Partners.However, as one observer seems to describe it, the company hit a hitch before it launched: it was essentially developing the same product as Amazon Redshifts data warehousing service, just before Redshift launched. When Amiato did eventually come out of stealth in March 2013, it pitched itself as a big data A/B testing platform for semi-structured data.Since then, it appears to have evolved further. As it notes on its own homepage, Amiatos Schema-lift technology extracts all the data from your NoSQL data stores, automatically transforms it, and loads it continuously into Redshift, Amazons petabyte-scale database. You can then immediately write SQL, connect Tableau or Excel, or use BI discovery tools like Looker.Given that there are a number of former Amiato employees and founders now working at Amazon, it seems like the move was made both as a technology and talent acquisition.As interest hascontinued to grow around how businesses can make the best use of the huge troves of data that they are harnessing in their businesses, Amazon has put a lot of effort into making sure that it is at the center of that trend, and Redshift is part of that strategy.Earlier this month, during the AWS Summit, Amazons CTO Werner Vogels notedthatOne of the services thats been on fire is Redshift, he said. Its the fastest-growing service in AWS, ever. He pointed out that the rapid scaling between nodes really hit something that enterprise and business need at this moment.AWS doesnt make lots of acquisitions, but it does so when it makes strategic sense. In March, Amazon acquired a startup called 2lemetry to build out AWSs Internet of Things technology.Well update the post as we learn more.
