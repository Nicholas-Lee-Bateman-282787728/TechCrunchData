Ive spent a lot of time in virtual reality. A whole lot. Were in the middle of building a VR testing lab at the TechCrunch office, and Im trying to iron out as many kinks as possible before said kinks end up costing me money. Between the Rift CV1 and the Vive, Ive spent more time in a VR headset than anyone who isnt building VR stuff should have at this early point.Ive come to realize a few things about VR in that time  things that werent immediately obvious when I was just pondering how neat VR could be, or during the many sessions Id had with the early developer headset prototypes.None of this is meant to make any grand statements about the future of VR. Consider it more of acaptains log from someone who has spent too many hours with a little box strapped to his face.
