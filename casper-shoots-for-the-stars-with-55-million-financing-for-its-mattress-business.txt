It seems that even the stars have come to rest on Casper beds.The 14-month-old startup has just confirmed its$55 million new round at a $550 million valuation ina celebrity filled investment syndicatedesigned to expand its business.Almost as impressive as the sky-high numbers are the big Hollywood names that have come down from the firmament and are throwing their money (if not their muscle) behind the company.The round was led by new investor Institutional Venture Partners and included some celebrities who you wouldnt typically associate with the bed business.Rounding out the rounds new investorsare Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Adam Levine, and Scooter Braun alongside new institutional investor Pritzker Group Venture Capital.Previous investors New Enterprise Associates, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Vaizra Investments, SV Angel, Slow Ventures and Nas Queensbridge Ventures also participated (shocking, becauseNas never sleeps).Last year, Casper announced $13.1 million in its Series A round. In all, the company has raised $69.95 million.Its another step on the road to hopefully one day having something big, says chief executive Phillip Krim.The new money will be used to expand Caspers research and development staff, increase the companys headcount beyond its current 75 employees, and begin laying the groundwork for international expansion.Last week Casperannounced its same-day delivery feature in San Francisco, one of many features the company is looking to add to beef up an already impressive sales figure.Right now, Casper is looking at a run-rate of $100 million, an impressive figure even taking into account the companys $1 million haul in its first month as a business.
