This afternoon, Microsoft released a new Windows 10 build for participants in its beta program for the forthcoming operating system.The build (10041 for those keeping score) includes a number of new features and fixes that well get to in a moment, but more importantly Microsoft has retooled its release program to get new, fresher code more quickly intothe market. The more than 3 million people whoare part of the Windows 10 testing group who elect to receive faster updates of less-solid code will now receive them at an accelerated rate.Gabe Aul, the publicface of Windows 10s update cycle, tells me that Microsoft has changed its federation process for builds, allowing the companyto more quickly get code into the hands ofusers who want a leading-edge experience. Testing will still occur inside of Microsoft before builds are released to those users, and Windows 10 users who select the slower build cycle wont be affected.According to Aul, public users on the faster release scheduleshould expect around a build per month.Microsoft is setting the tone for how it will build and release future Windows varietals. If it can lay a decent process with Windows 10, the next version of Windows  call it Windows 47  will have amarket-grokkable path from birth to launch.Whats NewAccording to a blog post, Microsoft has fixed a number of known bugs and introduced the following set of new features:All told, its a decent mix for an interim build. Id wager that we wont see too much more from the company until its Build developer conference , but would love to be wrong.Microsoft is effectively doubling down on its bet that getting the public onto its new operating system quickly, providing updates as it can, is a winning move. Given the number of testers that the company has accumulated, the strategy seems to be working.
