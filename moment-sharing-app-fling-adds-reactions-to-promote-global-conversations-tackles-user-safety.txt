Sending a message to the rest of the world can be a bold move, especially when its being sent to a bunch of random folk. Fling is looking to make the process of anonymous photo and video-sharingsafe and harassment-free all while providing a kick-ass user experience.The UK-based companyhas 4.5 million users right nowthat have sent out a staggering 50 billion momentsusing the service (if that number seems unbelievable, read on). Most of thecompanys users arein the heavily desired 16-21 age bracket and live in the UK and other areasof Europe, thoughFling is looking to expand heavily into the U.S. market following their latest update.The company has raised just under $20 million and is in the process of raising more currently.Millions of users and a lotof cash is great, but it doesnt matter unless your app is cool.Luckily, Fling has a remarkably well-designed app thats a blast to use.The premise is simple, in an innovative actually kind of confusing way, but after downloading the app, onscreen directions walk you through the process and youre good to go.When you stumble upon a moment youd love to share, which could be anything really,you take a photo and then fling it out to the globe, where between50and 500 totally random people end up seeing it (hence the 50 billion moments).Once they see it they have the ability to reply with a tap through a new feature called reactions. Whats cool is that, similar toa Snapchat Story, users can tap through the photos or videos and also see the reactions from other people whothe picwas randomly sent to. What results is a very global conversation that enables a great dealof exchange whether its in answering questions, giving an opinion or just saying hi.Its a very in-the-moment concept that is again very similar-feeling to Snapchat Stories, but with a lot less familiarity and a lot more potential to interact with new people from across the globe.As youre probably thinking, theres also a hugepotential for abuse.Early-on Fling struggledwith some significant challenges (i.e. dick pics, bullying) that have been knownto plague startups that allow users to interact with a certain degree of anonymity. Something we noted in the past.Fling founder and CEO Marco Nardone didnt want his app to turn into a platform that perpetuated bullying or harassment, especially abuse targeted toward our female users, so his company did something pretty radical, they stripped down functionality, removing chats and replies (pissing off a lot of users in the process) and then they put together a content moderation team to click through every piece of content that isbeing publicly sent out throughthe app.Now, every single thing that gets sent out gets put through our in-house moderation team thats operating 24/7, Nardone told TechCrunch. Fling has a team of 20 content screeners working around the clock to ensure that users arent leaving the app after sufferinga Chat Roulette-like negative experience.The app has also introduced some features to screen users whose content is being repeatedly removed and block their devicesfrom accessing the app again.All of this is being done, Nardone says, so that the app will be in a good position moving forwardas it gains more and more users.One of the big announcements Nardonetold me he was excited to tell users about was that the chat function will be returning to the app in early November, allowing users that are following each other to send private messages again. Fling only monitors public messages, so here the app has a couple features to allow users to report and block people that they are following if messaging turns to harassment.Sending a photo to random people online can feel like stepping into dangerous territory, but Fling is hoping that through their efforts in protecting users, they can help people share their life momentsin a safe, cool way.
