Hello from far-too-hot New York City, where Jonathan Shieber, Ingrid Lunden, and myself found a few chairs, a few beers, and a few topics to dig into as Disrupt came to a conclusion.This time around, we dealt withmassive capital rounds, Oculus recent news, and this thing called New York City.There is more footage that followed this session, involving an increasingly large cadre of TechCrunch staffers and beers that we might post if someone extorts us. In the interim, we hope that you had a lovely week and we appreciate to no end that you kick it with TechCrunch.
