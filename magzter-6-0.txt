With its latest update, Magzter is unveiling a more article-centric way to browse its library of digital magazines.Seems like a pretty obvious move, right? Sure, there are people who still read magazines cover to cover (says the guy whose apartment is filled with back issues of Wired and The New Yorker), but as Magzter co-founder and President Vijay Radhakrishnan put it, most of us dont crave to read a magazine that way. Whats cool about Magzters new article format is the fact that its optimized for wherever the article is being displayed. Radhakrishnan showed me articles on both his smartphone and tablet, and they looked good (the layout reminded me of Flipboard or a well-designed news website). In comparison, digital newsstandservice Texture released a new version with individual articles last fall, but those articles are basically just bookmarkedPDFs from a larger magazine that dont always look great on smaller screens.The new feature is available to anyone with a subscription to Magzter Gold, the companys Netflix-style service with all-you-can-readaccess to its library of magazines.Behind the scenes, Radhakrishnan said Magzter has developed a technology to automatically create these article layouts from a PDF, though human editors still have final approval. Magzter will also allow you to browse articles based on topic, to perform a full-text search and to share individual articles on social media. (You get 10 free articles each month on Magzter, so people can follow your link without paying.)Of course, when you talk about things like article-centric browsingand full-text search, it starts to sound like Magzter is just catching up with the web itself. The difference is the services library of thousands of magazines. If you like enough of the content, and if you cant find all of itonline, then the subscription price of $9.99$7.99can seem like a pretty good deal.
