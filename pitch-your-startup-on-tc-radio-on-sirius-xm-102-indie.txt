Every Tuesday, TechCrunchs John Biggs and I get off of our bloggy butts and head into the Sirius XM New York studios in mid-town. Why do we do this? To talk to you. TechCrunch is obsessed with startups, which is why weve made our weekly Sirius XM radio show into a weekly pitch-off. Just like we do in our TechCrunch regional meetups, participants have sixty seconds to describe their startup over the phone. Well pull in a VC to help us even out the judges panel, and get to work. If this sounds like something you might be into, keep on reading for full guidelines and an application form. We urge all of you to tune into TechCrunch Radio on Sirius XM Indie 102 on Tuesdays at 6pm ET/3PM PT, with a replay on the West Coast at 6pm PT. Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome.
3. You must be able to pitch your product with your words only.
4. You must be able to operate a telephone.Apply:Apply here.Its going to be a hoot!Each week, TechCrunch Radio will air Tuesdays at 6:00 pm ET with a replay at 6:00 pm PT, drive time for both coasts, on Indie, channel 102, and through the SiriusXM Internet Radio App on smartphones and other connected devices, as well as online at siriusxm.com.
