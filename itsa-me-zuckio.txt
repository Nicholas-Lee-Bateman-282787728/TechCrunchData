The latest perk of working at Facebook: getting to play the new Nintendo game Super Mario Maker a month before it comes out. Yesterday, Facebook hosted a hackathon where 100 employees built their own levels using Mario Maker.The game lets you make your own obstacle courses for the plumber using elements from Mario 1, 3, and Super Mario World. Teams competed for whose level was best. We saw fiendishly difficult boards, as well as ones with cute Facebook themes like Bowsers Timeline and Move Fast And Brick Things.Check out our video above to watch a preview of the game, get a taste of the hackathon and meet Mario himself.
