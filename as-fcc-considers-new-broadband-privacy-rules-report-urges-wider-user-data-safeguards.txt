A new report from U.S. consumer rights and privacy advocacygroup, the Center for Digital Democracy, has set out the case for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to tighten data protection rules around how ISPs and telcos collect and use consumer data.The FCC is currently consulting on proposals to changes to the ruleson how ISPs can gather and utilizecustomer data with an internal votedueat the end of this month. If thecommissioners vote for the rule changes (asexpected), a wider U.S. public consultation would then take place ahead of any new regulations being forged.Making thepublic case for updating consumer protectionsearlier this month, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler arguedit boils down to a matter of consumer choice.Every broadband consumer should have the right to know what information is being collected and how it is used. Every broadband consumer should have the right to choose how their information bits should be used and shared. And every consumer should be confident that their information is being securely protected, he wrotein an article in the Huff Po, flagging up thevisibility ISPs such as TechCrunchs parent AOLs parent Verizon can haveinto users digital lives.This is not to say network providers shouldnt be able to use information they collect  only that since it is your information, you should decide whether they can do so. This isnt about prohibition; its about permission.Simply by using the Internet, you have no choice but to share large amounts of personal information with your broadband provider, added Wheeler. You have a right to know what information is being collected about you and how that information is being used. Thats why establishing baseline privacy standards for ISPs is a common sense idea whose time has come. The bottom line is that its your data. How its used and shared should be your choice.The FCC chairmanis by no means the lone voice raising privacy concerns here.Back in JanuaryWheeler was senta letter co-signed by around 50 consumer rights and privacy organizations all urging the FCC to create stronger rules to regulate broadband providers use of data.What tracking is going on now and how the info is being used is in most cases not readily apparent, Susan Grant of the Consumer Federation of America one of the letters co-signatories  told TechCrunch at the time.The CDD was anotherco-signatory. In itsreport its now seeking to further flesh out whats at stake  by profilingin some detail the data harvesting practices of specificISPs and cable providers, including AT&T, Comcast, Dish Network, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, Disney/ABC, News Corp (Fox) and others, as well asdetailingsome of the interplay between ISPs/broadband/cable providers and different data brokers and larger Internet companies also involved.Its this complex and non-transparent (from aconsumer point of view)webof data harvesting and processingrelationships thathas enabledISPs to amasssophisticated consumer tracking and ad targeting infrastructures in recent years (including via the acquisition route), the CDD argues.ISPs have made partnerships with powerful data brokers, giving them insights into our online and offline behaviors. They are incorporating state-of-the-art Big Data practices  such as programmatic advertising  that significantly threaten the privacy of subscribers and consumers, it writes.The stealth data-profiling apparatus that determines whether a person is bought, sold, or ignored, and used to target family, friends and others, requires the Federal Communications Commission to address the use and consequences of practices that threaten privacy and pose consumer-protection concerns, the report adds.The CDD is urging the FCC to adopt rules to help reverse what it dubs the tide of ever-growing and unchecked collection and use of consumer data across devices.A truly open Internet that embraces network neutrality must have privacy and consumer protection at its core. Otherwise, powerful data and digital marketing gatekeepers will be in an even more influential position to influence the kinds and diversity of programming available in the marketplace, it goes on to assert, suggesting there is a risk ofconsumer informationbeing used in unfair anddiscriminatory ways that can harm individuals and families  by, forexample, financial databeing used totarget high-interest credit card or loan offers to at-risk consumers; the singling out of seniorsto promote unnecessary medical devices and services; basing targeting profiles on racialand ethnic data; and taking advantage of young people.The CDD is advocating for consumer protection rules and privacy policies that reflect Fair Information Practices, rather than just requiring opt-in consumer consent for data harvesting and processing  arguing for a total bar on pervasive and continuous data collection, such as viacrossdevicetracking (a technique used by TechCrunchs parent AOL, for instance) and offline/online data profiling; and for data minimization safeguardsto ensure that online records are kept to a minimum and cannot be used for ongoing targeting. It also wants a ban on deep-packet inspection being used byISPs to allowthem to examine the content of communications.As youd expect, ISPs are opposed to the FCCs proposals for stricter regulations around data use and consumer privacy  and have claimedthey are amply regulated by the FTC already. However they may well be whistling into the wind there. The FCCs reclassification of broadband as a public utility last year has paved the way for what is a more powerful regulatory body with (unlike the monitoring body, the FTC) legal authority to create new rules. Last years strictnet neutrality rulesnow look like only the FCCsfirst order of business, vis-a-vis broadband providers.Beyond ISPs philosophical objections to being more strictly schooled in how much snooping they can do on users, onemore specific criticism ofthe FCCs proposals made by ISPs and others  is that itfocuses only onISPs and does notloop in larger Internet companies, such as Google, which may alsohave amassed sophisticated data processing, user tracking and ad-targeting capabilities. Internet companies remain the regulatory purview of the FTC.Indeed, the CDD report itself includes Google as one ofthe companies profiled, noting that the company is in the forefront of using programmatic and other data-driven advertising across platforms, including digital video and adding: Google illustrates how the role of data and our use of digital devices is fundamentally transforming our viewing across screens.I added Google and others to show that the basic data collection business model  all your data, all the time  is impacting every part of the media, communications and advert sector, addsthe CDDs Jeffrey Chester, when asked about this. While ISPs have unique and powerful ways to capture consumer data, such as deep packet inspection, they are part of a digital environment where privacy is always at risk.Earlier this month, in a response to the FCCs proposals, the Electronic PrivacyInformation Center also called for the new privacy rules to be applied more broadly.While ISPs are engaged in invasive consumer tracking and profiling practices, focusing only on these providers misses a vast amount of data collection activities by other service providers, it argued, also calling for the FCCto establish a broad framework for communications privacy, based on Fair Information Practices.And in another blurring of the line here, one of the big Internet companies in question (Google) is also an ISP (via its fiber program). Albeit a far more dominantInternet company than it is ISP.The CDD report notes thatGoogle is using data-targeted ads as part of its Google Fiber Internet and TVservice in Kansas City, adding that: Google Fiber set-top boxes are IP based, which allows for continuous monitoring and changes via the cloud  including for targeted marketing.You can read the full CDD report here.
