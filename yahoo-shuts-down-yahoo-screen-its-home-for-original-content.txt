According to a report by Variety, and confirmation by Yahoo, Yahoo Screen has closed its doors with its content being split among its various magazine properties.Screen launched in 2013 as a place to house Yahoos original content, which the company has since backed away from (remember the $42 million write-down?). From bringing back the show Community to airing an overseas NFL game, the plan was to turn Screen into a more refined version of YouTube. It clearly didnt work.Variety reports that Katie Couric will continue to do her daily news show, probably under the Yahoo News umbrella. Heres the statement Yahoo provided to the publication:At Yahoo, were constantly reviewing and iterating on our products as we strive to create the best user experience. With that in mind, video content from Yahoo as well as our partners has been transitioned from Yahoo Screen to our Digital Magazine properties so users can discover complementary content in one place.The service was shuttered last week and the apps have been removed from Apples App Store as well as Google Play:Screen at one time was the crown jewel of Mayers MaVeNS turnaround approach and touted over a thousand hours of viewable content, including the Saturday Night Live catalog.
