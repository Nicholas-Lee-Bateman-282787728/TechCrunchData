Hey Siri, give me a hint. Apple just invited journalists to its annual September press event. Its happening on September 9th at 10am. But the best part of this invite is the attention to detail and Apples Easter eggs.The invite starts with a simple sentence  hey Siri, give us a hint. And Apple programmed many, many different hints. None of them are actually useful. But its pretty funny to see that Apple takes its marketing copy very seriously.Rumor has it that Apple will unveil the new iPhone and the new Apple TV. Maybe we will see new iPads as well, maybe not.On the iPhone front, many leaks indicate that we will get an iPhone 6s with a better camera sensor, a better processor, a sturdier shell to avoid bendgate complaints and Force Touch.The Apple TV hasnt been updated since 2012. Its time for an upgrade. The new device should pack a better processor in a slimmer design with more internal storage. Apple may also announce a new App Store for the TV, putting its media device on par with competitors such as the Fire TV and Nexus Player. But it looks like Apples own TV subscription service wont be ready for September.Heres the invite:
