Amazon Prime members who are also frequent travelers will now have another new benefit coming to them as part of their annual membership. The companythis morning announced it has inked a deal with JetBlue to bring Amazon Prime Instant Video to the airline, allowing customers to watch tens of thousands of movies and TV shows thatwill be made available over JetBlues high-speed Fly-Fi broadband Internet.This is the first time that Amazon has partnered with an airline to power an in-flight entertainment option. More importantly, it will put Amazons video service in front of non-Prime members, as well, as the JetBlue deal will allow all passengers the option to rent or purchase titles from the Amazon Instant Video store.AmazonsInstant Video store includes new release movies and day-after TV programming, which will provide JetBlues customers with a range of viewing choices. And it will allow Amazon the ability to advertise its Prime membership program, which includes the Netflix competitor Prime Instant Video, in front of a captive (literally!)audience.The deal will also allow Prime members to access the 1million tracks from Prime Music from the air, as well as the ability to purchase and download songs from the Amazon Music store, e-books from the Kindle store, as well as apps and games from the Amazon Appstore.But the tie-in is advantageous to JetBlue, too  with the partnership, customers will be able to earn TrueBlue points when they shop from specific categories on Amazon while using the airlines free Fly-Fi broadband Internet service while in-flight or via other JetBlue promotions. And while JetBlues Internet has been ranked one of the fastest in the sky today, the new partnershipwill also allow the airlineto further differentiate its Internet servicefrom others in the industry.JetBlues Internet service uses satellite technology to offer customers broadband speeds. Access to Amazons video entertainment library will be built into the JetBlue Fly-Fi Hub, which letscustomers watch titles without having to download an app or the content itself in advance of the flight.The Internet service will be available on all of JetBlues Airbus A321 and A320 aircraft this year, and on JetBlues Embraer E190 aircraft in 2016. Amazons integrations will also go live later this year.With this deal, JetBlues Fly-Fi broadband Internet for streaming, will be made free for all customers. Planes with Fly-Fi (beta) support streaming video, but today itcosts $9 per hour.While the companies arent disclosing the specificsof their business arrangement, reading between the lines, it sounds like Amazon may be helping to keep JetBlues Internet free by nature of this partnership.Amazons customer focus aligns perfectly with the experience we have created for our customers, including the best inflight entertainment, free unlimited snacks and beverages, lots of personal space with the most legroom in coach, and wide, comfortable seating, said Jamie Perry, vice president of brand and product development for JetBlue, in a statement released this morning. By teaming up with a category-leader like Amazon, we created a unique model where we can offer complimentary broadband internet access.
