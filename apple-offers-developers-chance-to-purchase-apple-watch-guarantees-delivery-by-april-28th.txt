Apple is sending out emails to developers, offering them a chance to purchase an Apple Watch Sport for delivery by April 28th. Its doing this to encourage them to test and develop for the Watch, according to the text of an email sent to developers and shared with us.The email, pictured below, says that Apple wants to give developers the opportunity to test WatchKit apps on Apple Watch as soon as its available. It offers the ability to purchase one Apple Watch Sport with the 42mm silver casing and a blue sport band. The Watch is guaranteed to ship by April 28 at 2015, which is probably the biggest draw as if developers hadnt pre-ordered already then they were looking at June or July delivery times. The email states that there are limited quantities set aside and that developers need to register via the Apple Developer Portal by April 23 at 10am PST  and that the status of the order will be delivered that day.Apple is clearly courting developers hard to get their apps ready for the Watch launch, even at the cost of potentially irritating Watch purchasers who saw their order times slip quickly if they werent quick on the draw.Apples email says the offering is being made by random selection  and the developers weve seen receiving the letter run the gamut of app types. Having a test unit early would definitely aid developers in providing a wider array of Watch apps for the first run crowd.Its likely that several million (Im hearing more than estimates Ive seen out there so far) Apple Watch units have been sold already  and that more have been ordered than previously reported. Having useful apps ready could make or break the first wave word of mouth.Weve reached out to Apple for more information on the offer.Article headline has been corrected to note shipment, not delivery date promised in email.
