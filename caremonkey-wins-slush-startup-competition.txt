Another day, another massive tech conference in Europe. This time were in Helsinki for the annual Slush conference, where 15,000 people wander around what appears to be a dark, laser-lit aircraft hangar full of startups stalls, while squinting at a map which has helpfully been printed in 4 Point on a black background. Aside from those quibbles, Slush is its usual mix of fantastic networking, speakers and startups, and their startup competition has produced interesting companies in the past, such as FishBrain.The winner this year is CareMonkey, which automates the collection and secure distribution of sensitive personal data for groups.CareMonkey is an Australian based software company headquartered in Melbourne, but has a globally distributed team. Its a health, safety and productivity solution for families, schools, clubs, businesses, community service organisations and other groups with a duty of care.The pitch is that they save time for organisations and families by allowing them to share sensitive information in a secure and private manner, without the burden and security issues related to paper.They also save time and reduce the chances of medical errors in emergencies by providing instant access to emergency and medical data on mobiles devices  even when theyre offline.
