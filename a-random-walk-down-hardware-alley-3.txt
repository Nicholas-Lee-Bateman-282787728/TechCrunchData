Every Disrupt I gather some of the coolest hardware startups in the world into one place  Hardware Alley. This cavalcade of gear is one of my favorite parts of Disrupt and I try to walk through the entire thing on video so you can meet some of the startups. Some of my favorites? The Parashoot, Supplyhog, and the kitten toy Kittyo  although everyone was great.Take a gander and well have the second half of the video up shortly.
