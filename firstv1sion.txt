The Lithuanian teamalgiris Kaunas will wear theshirts in their match against Real Madrid, which will be broadcast by 12 channels globally, including Canal+ in Spain.FirstV1sionssmart garment contains an embedded HD camera and microphone, sited on the chest, plus additional sensors  includinga heart rate monitor and accelerometers  so it can broadcast first person views and also track the wearers velocity and biometric data.
