If you want the new build, make sure that you are on the fast release ring. Otherwise, you will have to sit tight.The development pace of Windows 10 remains rapid. Its been notable to watch the enthusiasm gap between the current Windows 10 release cycle, and what took place with Windows 8. Thats to say that people seem to care more this time around.An example of this is my new Twitter nemesis, Gabe Aul from the Windows 10 team, who regularly racks up oodles of favorites for his oracular drippings concerning when new code might, or might not, land:Riveting.
