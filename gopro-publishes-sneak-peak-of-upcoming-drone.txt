GoPro is working on a drone thats scheduled for release in early 2016. The company just posted a sneak peak of footage captured from the new drone. Spoiler: Its silky smooth.This footage was released an hour after GoPro announced a disappointing third quarter financial statement, which caused the stock price to crash 18% in after-hours trading. Analysts are skeptical about GoPros potential growth and the ability to monetize the video produced by its cameras. A drone could help nudge GoPro back in the right direction.The footage shows a very smooth image. Its unclear if this is the work of camera-side software or hardware stabilization, but the smart money is on a combination of both.GoPro CEO Nick Woodman revealed GoPros drone ambitions early this year noting that the company was building its own drone, which will be available in 2016. Its widely speculated that GoPro enlisted the help of DJI to build the drone (Walmart is also using DJI for their drone program).Last month at TechCrunch Disrupt Woodman explained that GoPro is looking to drones to help push the GoPro camera to a new vantage point. The companys cameras have already been a key part to drones available from other companies. Clearly, GoPro is hoping buyers of its cameras will also buy its drone.
