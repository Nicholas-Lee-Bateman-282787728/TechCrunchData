Need something to spark a bit of creativity this week? How about a super clever hack for Amazons $5, single-purpose Dash buttons?The Dash buttons were originally meant to serve as a quick way to reorder household goods you order often (Order a lot of laundry detergent? Stick a Dash button on your washing machine, press it when youre running low. Bam. Ordered.), but Cloudstitch CTO Ted Benson has found a way to make themdo pretty much anything he wants.You can read Bensons full breakdown right over here, but heres the gist:One catch: whereas the factory Dash can act on its own, a modified Dash will need something  a computer, generally  awake and running on your network to sniff out the button presses and respond accordingly. It complicates the equation a bit, but its still a fun hack.
