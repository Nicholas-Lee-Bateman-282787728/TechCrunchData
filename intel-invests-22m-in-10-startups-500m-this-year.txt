Intel Capital, the venture arm of the tech giant, today announced $22 million in new investments across 10 startups. The news was delivered at the companys annual global summit, where it also said that it would invest half a billion dollars in total this year.This is both a rise and fall of sorts. Asa point of comparison, during the same event last year, Intel announced $67 million of investments in 16 startups, but said that 2014 investments totaled $359 million.It seems that $67 million is a magic number for Intel: the company announced the same amount of investments in Chinese startups just this past September.Todays investments cover a range of companies running from later stages in larger and more established startups through to newer companies and emerging technologies, and come from five countries: China, Israel, Taiwan, the UK, and the U.S. Intel is not disclosing the value of any individual stake today.FreedomPop, a provider of free wireless voice and data services that makes its money on value-added options like voicemail, extra data allowances and so on.
