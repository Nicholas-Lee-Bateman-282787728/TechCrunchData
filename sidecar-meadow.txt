Meadow, a YC-backed startup in the medical marijuana space, is partnering with Sidecar to do quick medical marijuana deliveries throughout the city of San Francisco. It follows recent moves by much bigger companies like Google and Uber, which are diving headfirst into the delivery space with services like UberRush and Google Shopping Express.The partnership with Sidecar will allow dispensaries throughout the city, which lack couriers, to quickly sign-up for a turnkey delivery system. Sidecar and Meadow will handle the drivers and logistics.This is the next step of creating a delivery solution for dispensaries that dont have drivers or that want to scale their existing delivery network, said Meadow CEO David Hua, who added that there are 28dispensaries in the city.Only a few of them have actual drivers and delivery services.Meadows first partner is The Apothecarium, which has been working with Meadow for several months already on the companys original app.When a patient places an order at The Apothecarium on Meadow, a Sidecar driver will get dispatched. All of the drivers will be card-holding medical marijuana patients who are also members of the dispensary. Theyll take the order, put it in a lockbox in the trunk of a car and deliver it within an hour.Thisadds to Meadows existing suite of services. The startup alsosupportsa program called CannabisMD, which does scheduledmedical marijuana evaluations where the company will actuallydispatch a doctor to your home for a consultation.
