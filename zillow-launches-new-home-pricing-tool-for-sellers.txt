Online real estatesite Zillow is launching a new home-price estimate tool today that allows users to create a custom and private estimate for their homes based on recently sold homes and comparable listings.If this sounds familiar, its probably because Zillowhas long offered price estimates forvirtually every home in the U.S. through its Zestimates feature. Recently, Redfin launched a very similar feature and a number of startups like Surefieldare also getting into the home-price estimate business.The new Price This Home feature allows sellers to claim their home on Zillow and update facts about it (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage, for example). After this, users can then select from a list of similar homes that are currently for sale or that recently sold.Given that Zillow already offers estimates for millions of homes, this new feature may seem a bit redundant. But asZillow also tells me, the Price This Home feature essentiallyputs sellers into control of its Zestimate algorithm.Its also worth noting that most automated tools can only select homes based on the basic data about them, but they cant take different styles and preferences into account, for example.Once sellers select their comparables, Zillow will provide them with a private estimate thats likely a bit more precise that the Zestimate and  of course  try to connect the homeowner with an agent. At its heart, after all, Zillow is still essentially a sophisticated referral service.
