Debuting in prototype-form at CES a few years ago, the URB-E is finally ready for the spotlight.Weighing just under 35 pounds, the foldable scootercan carry an adult up to 20 miles at a topspeed of around 15 MPH.Today at CES I metwith the URB-E team, andthey walked me through their new product.All models are made using aircraft-grade anodized aluminum and carbon fiber handles, and include a removable lithium-ion battery that is fully chargeable within four hours.Interestingly, the battery has a USB connection, meaning you can plug in accessories like headlights, brake lights, or even an adapter to charge your iPhone.The URB-E is now available for sale, and thescooter is retailingin a variety of colors for $1,499 or a black label edition for $1,699, which comes with a little more torque.
