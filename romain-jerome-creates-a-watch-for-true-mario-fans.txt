Do you like Nintendo? Do you have $19,000? I think we found you a watch. The Romain Jerome Super Mario Bros. the watchmakers take on good old Mario and his mushroom-induced adventures and is aimed at collectors who arent afraid to drop twenty grand on nostalgia.The watch is RJs third arcade-themed piece and joins his Pac Man watch as well as his Space Invaders piece. The watch has an automatic movement but the real work went into the face which features a 3D playing field and enameled figures including a mushroom, a cloud, a bush, and finally a mightily-jumping Mario. The case is 46mm wide and the watch is limited to 85 pieces in honor of the games launch in 1985.Obviously youre not going to drop $20K on this thing (right?) but its a fun piece from one of the manufacturers who are actually tying to do something a little different in the luxury oeuvre. Plus Mario looks great up close.via ABlogToWatch
