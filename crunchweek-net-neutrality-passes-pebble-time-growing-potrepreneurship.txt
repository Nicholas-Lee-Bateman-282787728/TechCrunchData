Its the end of another week in tech and what a week its been! The FCC passed new net neutrality regulations and then the Internet exploded. First it was about the net neutrality news, then we quickly turned our attention to some llamas, and soon after that everyone divided over the color of a dress (do we even deserve net neutrality?).In any case, this week, Sarah Buhr, Alex Wilhelm and Kyle Russell band together to discuss the FCCs decision, whether or not Pebble Time has a chance against the Apple Watch and the sweet, sweet smell of potrepreneurship.Have a lovely weekend, folks.
