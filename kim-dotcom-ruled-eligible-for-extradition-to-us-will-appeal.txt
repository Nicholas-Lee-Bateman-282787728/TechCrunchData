After a ten week trial and more than 3 years after the raid on Kim Dotcoms mansion, a New Zealand judge has denied an extradition stay for Kim Dotcom and his three business associates.This means thatthe group is now eligible to be extradited to the United States to face copyright related charges stemming from his involvement in file-sharing site MegaUpload.However, this doesnt Dotcom will end up in the US anytime soon. The ultimate decision will rest on the shoulders of New Zealand Justice Minister Amy Adams. But before Adams can make a decision, Dotcoms legal team will appeal the decision to the NZ High Court.The @KimDotcom team looks forward to having the US request for extradition reviewed in the High Court.We have no other comments at this time Ira Rothken (@rothken) December 23, 2015Under the extradition treaty between the US and NZ, Dotcom was eligible for extradition ontwo charges  money laundering and racketeering. While there are protections against extraditionfor New Zealand residents, Dotcom (a German and Finnish duel-citizen) is only a NZ permanent resident.Todays decision was in no way a conviction  it simply means that the NZ Judge ruledthat the US has enough evidence to warrant a legitimate case in a United States court. Even after three years, there are still layers of appeals and bureaucracy standing between Dotcom and an American prison.Until an appeal is heardDotcom will remain out on bail, living in a newly rented waterfront residence. Dotcom moved out of his infamous countryside mansion a few weeks ago, citing mounting legal fees as the reason for the downgrade.
