If you are anything like me youd rather order the food than make it in your kitchen. But every so often in the cold of winter I get the itch to play Martha Stewart. The problem is Im missing key ingredients in almost every recipe I want to try. Pinterest-like recipe platformYummly is hoping to solve that for those like myself by partnering with grocery delivery startup Instacart.The partnership will enable those on the Yummly iOS app to pick out recipes and get them delivered via Instacart within an hour. Normally an Instacart order is not that immediate but you (and I) need that ingredient now, not later tonight or tomorrow. TheInstacart personal shopper will see your order from Yummly, gather your ingredients and deliver them to you so you dont have to trek to the store and get it right when you need to make your meal.Yummly is a fast-growing recipe platform with over 15 million active users now. The Instacart integration with Yummly makes sense here and we should expect to see more of the same in the future. Instacart is expected to continue to grow and expand with a recent raise of $210 million.Yummly and Instacart are aligned on our technology-driven understanding of food and focus on delighting the customer, said Apoorva Mehta, founder and CEO of Instacart.The new Instacart service is available through Yummly starting today in Atlanta, Austin, Boulder, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, Portland, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and Washington, D.C.
