Scandy is aiming to make it easier to print full-color 3D prints of photographs, from sources such as depth-aware cameras and technology like Googles Project Tango. Scandytoday announced itraised a $1 million angel/seed round fromCallais Capital in an effortto bring the technology to a broader audience.Being able to spin a 360 photo around in your hand has a certain Polaroid-esque retro-futuristic feel to itIf youre shooting 360 photographs taken withthe rapidly growing number of360 cameras, Scandy can make yousome really nifty spherical prints.The challenge with 360 photography is, of course, that (most) screens are flat.Using a VR headset is one way to solve that problem, and looking around a 360 world using a headset is undeniably appealing. However, as anyone who has ever stared at a map of the world in globe form knows, the only sensible way to look at these type of images in printed form is in three dimensions.Of course, showinga 2D photograph of a 3D object puts us right back on the same problem, so heres a video that illustrates why this is nifty:Pretty cool, eh? Finally, a way for me to print thoseRicoh Theta S pictures Ive been capturing.Its not just about spheres, however; Scandy has a whole gallery of prints showing off what theyre up to. If you dont have a 3D cameralaying about, the companyalso creates its own iOSsoftware to enable you to take full-surround photos.Scandy has an opportunity to define how users capture and consume 3D content. We are excited to be part of this tremendous growth opportunity, said Hal Callais, Managing Director and CIO of Callais Capital Management. By allowing a user to create 3D content, share it on social media, and order 3D prints from the same application, Scandy has made 3D easy for the average consumer.The companys iOS app is live already, and the Android app is coming by the end of the month.
