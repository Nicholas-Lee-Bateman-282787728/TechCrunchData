If at first you dont succeed, try, try again.Googles latest attempt to get its operating system for TVs embedded on consumer electronics devices has attracted a handful of partners, which were announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. In a blog post today, the search giant said TVs from Sony, Sharp and Philips would begin shipping soon.The company introduced the latest version of its smart TV operating system at Google I/O last June, and first made it available to consumers through the launch of its own Nexus Player late last year.But for Android TV to gain real market penetration, it would need some help. That starts with bringing consumer electronics partners on board to create devices that had Android TV embedded in them.As is usual with these things, Android TV takes some pressure off device makers, since they wont need to create their own operating systems for smart connected devices. Thats why companies like TCL, Hisense, Haier and Best Buys Insignia brand are developing devices based on Rokus operating system.This isnt the first time Google has announced partners for a TV operating system. After all, its been working on this type of thing for the last four or five years.
