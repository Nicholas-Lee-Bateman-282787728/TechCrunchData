After launching a standalone app for Ola Money in November last year, Indian transportationapp Ola has made an acquisition to double down on its mobile wallet and payments business: the company has acquired Qarth, a startup that has developed a mobile payments app calledX-Pay.Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. The is the third acquisition announced by Ola, and the first to build out an aspect of its business beyond basic transportation.With acquisitions like Qarth, we are investing in building seamless digital payment solutions,Anand Subramanian, Senior Director, Marketing Communications at Ola, said in a statement.As we work towards our mission of building mobility for a billion people, we will continue to build for a best in class payment experience for our users.Qarths X-Pay app (Android-only)integrates with some 26 banks in India, providing those who have accounts at these banks to use theapp to make one-touchmobile payments or money transfers.It has picked up some users but has not been a runaway hit: since going live in December 2014, X-Payhas had between 10,000 and 50,000 installs. As a point of comparison, PayTMs payment and wallet app has had between 10 million and 50 million installs, while Ola Money has had between 100,000 and 500,000 installs on Google Play.The X-Pay app is going to remain live for now, Ola tells me, but it sounds like its technology will also be integrated into Ola Money to build out the functionality that Ola can offer its users.Ubersrival in India is backed by the likes of Softbank, Sequoia, DST and Chinas Didi Kuaidi, and it has raised just under $1.2 billion (most recently $500 million in November). Olasprevious acquisitionswereTaxiForSure to expand intolow-cost rides; and GeoTagg to grow Olaslogistics platform.For its part, Qarth had been incubated in the IIT academic system and co-foundersAbhinav SrivastavaandPrerit Srivastava, along withthe rest of their team, will be joining Ola Money.The rise of Olas payments business is a unique development that may not have an obvious correlation for the likes of Uber and Olas network partner Lyft inthe U.S.  not immediately, at least.(While Lyft and Uber have created some payment infrastructure in their services, this has been mainly connected to making paying for rides and goodsmore frictionless for passengers, and drivers getting paid more quickly. Its yet to be seen whether either company tries to leverage those payment relationships for other kinds of services.)Ola Money was partly borne out of a regulatory need: because credit and debit cards are not that ubiquitous, those who operate transportation appsand want to accept card or non-cash payments provide passengers with a wallet service where users can keep a float to pay for their rides.But quickly realising thatthe sums of money that people were keeping in their Ola Money walletwere bigger than what users were spending on rides alone, Ola expanded the service to cover more than simply rides on its own network.In India,card payments are not as ubiquitous as they are in the West, and so cash payments are still a popular way for consumers to pay for rides. Uber, despite a late entry into cash acceptance in India, is fast expanding its own cash program. But from what we understand, Olas recently tipped overand now takes more transactions for rides via Ola Money than it does by cash.And that is ultimatelythe way Ola wants things to go: cash is messy and more of a liability, while card and wallet payments givepeople a looser regard for how they are spending their money.It also opens the door to Ola making commissions on transactions, even those that may have nothing at all to do with transportation. Olas essentially looking at how it can transform from a company that helps you get from A to B to a company that can more generally helps you get things done.Having a payments service and control of a consumer wallet canpotentially help withOlas margins on its burgeoning transporation empire, too. Marginsare not something to be underestimated when launching new services: Ola recently shuttered its food delivery pilot, reportedly in part because of the costs of running the business coupled with a lack of user uptake.
