It does this by analyzing thousands of insurance plans within seconds and coming up with the best rate. Co-founder Vivek Shah compares it to the way travel sites pull up the best airfare prices and then let you compare the price with the time and other details important to your needs.But finding a good price is just one of the myriad pain points surrounding group health insurance. Add to that the chaotic run-around, paper work and other minutiae that has been tacked on to our bloated health care system.

New York-based Oscar Health Insurance offers its own insurance;Zenefitsincludes third-party options and offers price comparisons through its HR administration software; andCollective Health allows employers to cobble together unique services, depending on employee needs.SimplyInsured provides comparisonpricing and plan details and handles the paperwork involved in group health insurance  key areas of distress for small businesses looking to provide coverage for employees.Shah declined to offer revenue numbers for the startup but did say it was mostly bootstrapped, save for the seed funding. He also mentionedthat the startup is currentlypulling in more than $1 million in sales per month for largeinsurance networkslike Kaiser Permanente and Anthem Blue Cross.There are 12 employees working at SimplyInsured now, and Shah islooking to bringabout 30-50 more people on board in the near future, most of whom will be in engineering and sales and marketing. The engineers will be working on a new Virtual Broker product that quietly launched on the site two weeks ago, whichis meant to replace traditional insurance brokers.
