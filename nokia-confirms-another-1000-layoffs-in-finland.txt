As a late Friday coda to this weeks news of Nokias old feature phone business getting soldonce again, todayNokia quietly confirmedit is layingoff 1,032 employees in its home market of Finland. The cuts will come across all business units, with half outofits HQ in Espoo. The majority of cuts will happen bythis summer.On top of putting the news out in the evening on the very last day of the week, the announcementwas downplayed by being releasedonly in Finnish.The layoffs are theconclusion of a formal process that started in April, when Nokia said it would lay off up to 1,300 people in the country. At the time, some reported that the cuts were part of a widercost-cutting process that would reportedly see up to 15,000 jobs cutglobally in the wake of Nokiasmergerwith Alcatel Lucent and a bid to cut some 900 million ($1 billion) by 2018.Nokia has never commented onthe larger number of layoffs but did confirmin its last quarterly earnings that it it was embarking on a headcount reduction between now and 2018.As of December 2015, the company employed almost 56,000 people.The layoffs are a difficultbutinevitable progression of a bigger shift at the company as it has moved from being the worlds biggest mobile phone maker into one that focuses primarilyon networking technologies as well as developing and licensing IP related to that and its historical business.This weeks news attests to that shift: When Microsoft soldNokiasphone business to HMD and Foxconns FIH earlier this week, Nokia inked a licensing dealwithHMDfor brand and IP assets.In other words, as Nokiacontinues to pare down and shift the business, itdoesnt need the same workforceit used to.Small silver lining: Nokia says that its still offering laid-off employees access to the Bridge program that it started several years ago at the beginning of its massive downsizing wave. Optionsinclude a small amount of funding for a new venture if you want to try your hand at your own business, or consulting to help place you in a job if you do not, plus other assistance. Hundreds of ex-Nokians have taken up the company on the offer to date.
