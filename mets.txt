TechCrunch went out to the ballpark this week  specifically Citi Field, home of the New York Mets.Granted, it wasnt the most tech-centric event, but the stadium has seen some changes between seasons  including the addition of a big LED Coca-Cola sign, which looms over the new Coca-Cola Corner in right field. Apparently, the sign is the second largest freeform display in Major League Baseball.The Mets will play the years first game at Citi Field on April 8, against the Phillies.
