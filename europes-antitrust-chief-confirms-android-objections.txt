Europes antitrust chief has confirmed the Commission is stepping up an ongoing investigation into whether Googles Android mobile OS is in breach of regional competition law, issuing a formalStatement of Objections today.Setting out what it described as its preliminary view, the Commission said it believes Google has implementeda strategy on mobile devices to preserve and strengthen its dominance in general internet search.The move comes a year after the EC announced an in-depth probe into Android rivals concerns that Google is using its mobile platformas a Trojan horse to pushadoption of its other apps and services, such as Google search.Specific allegationslisted in the Statement of Objections are that Google has breached EU competition law by:That tie between [Googles] Play [app] Store and other [Google] apps is what we see as a very problematic behaviour, said Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, speaking during a press conference confirmingthe formal charges.There should be an incentive to innovate and one of the strongest incentives to innovate is you can present your product to consumers. And that is what is at stake here  it has become too difficult for other products, other app stores to present their apps to the consumer.Givingone example, she characterizedit asquite tricky for consumers who have an Android device that is pre-loaded with the Google Play store to use other app stores because alternative app stores cannot be downloaded fromGoogle Play.Its quite tricky to find another shop to do your shopping for apps and that of course is because of limitations on the manufacturer  of the free choice of the manufacturer as to how to present the product to the consumer. And that of course puts very strong limitations on the consumer as to what can I do.Vestager also said her department hadfound evidence that some manufacturers haddecided not to use an alternative version of Android  developed by what she couched as a credible competitor  due to Googles behavior.Google does offer an open source version of Android, with no stipulations on how manufacturers can use it and the apps and services they can pre-load or not pre-load. But the Commissions suggestion here is that Googlescarrots for using Android are so large as to effectivelyamount to sticks.We have concerns that this hampers the development of rival versions of Android which could develop into credible platforms for competing apps and services, added Vestager.She also highlighted as problematic the fact the companyprovides financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile carriers  on condition thatGoogle search is pre-installed as the exclusive search provider on their devices.We have found evidence, as a result, that device manufacturers and mobile network operators have refrained from pre-installing alternative search services, she noted.In a Q&A with journalists, she went on to describe the structure of these financial incentives as a kind of revenue sharing. In our opinion, as we see it right now, it is preventing competition from happening because of the strength of the financial incentive, she added.Google now has 12 weeks to respond to the Commissions Statement of Objections.Vestager stressed this is an interim step in the process of investigatingwhether the Commission considers Android to be in violation of regional antitrust rules.I will obviously carefully consider Googlesargument before determining how to proceed, she said.Weve reached out to Google for comment and will update this post with theirresponse.Update:In an emailed statement,Kent Walker, SVPand general counsel at Google, said:Android has helped foster a remarkable  and, importantly, sustainable  ecosystem, based on open-source software and open innovation. We look forward to working with the European Commission to demonstrate that Android is good for competition and good for consumers.Following its usual policy response playbook, Google has also published a blog outlining its arguments  in which it assertsthat its partner agreements are entirely voluntary, andadds that anyone can use Android without Google, name-checking Amazon as an example of a major company that has forked the platform.Any manufacturer can choose to load the suite of Google apps to their device and freely add other apps as well. For example, phones today come loaded with scores of pre-installed apps (from Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google, mobile carriers, and more), Googlegoes on to note.Of course while Android is free for manufacturers to use, its costly to develop, improve, keep secure, and defend against patent suits. We provide Android for free, and offset our costs through the revenue we generate on our Google apps and services we distribute via Android.The leading coalition of Android antitrust complainants, gathered under the umbrella moniker FairSearch, has also issued a responsedescribing the ECs formal charges today as a crucial step to end abusive business practices surrounding the Android mobile platform.Google launched Android as an open source project, allowing anyone to change it and write a new version. Today, Google actively hinders the possibility of developing versions that might lead to new operating systems able to vigorously compete against Android,FairSearch added in its statement.Google effectively imposes exclusivity on both smart phone makers and wireless providers with revenue sharing arrangements that require them to promote Googles own applications to the detriment of competitors.FairSearch member companies include Expedia, Nokia, Oracle and TripAdvisor.Microsoft, the maker of the Bing search engine, was also previously providing financial backing to the group, although the companyterminated its membership earlier this year.When it comes tothe competitive damage caused by Googles behavior with Android, as the Commissionsees it,Vestagers view is thatthe way Google controls the ecosystem with stipulations and incentives has not only impacted the search marketbut has more generally led to a stifling of competition  andeven to restricting innovation in the wider space.Its certainly true to say that alternative mobile platforms have floundered in the face of the massive dominance of the Android ecosystem. Microsofts Windows OS for mobile has a global marketshare in the region of just one per cent, while other alternatives  such as Jollas Sailfishplatform have had an even harder time trying to carve out a niche.Meanwhile, stepping away from the Android allegations, another EC antitrust investigation pertaining to Google  the long-running probe into the Google Shopping search price comparison service  is still ongoing, withVestager noting today that her department hasreceived and iscurrently analyzing Googles response to the Statement of Objections issued last year.Google has given us a detailed response to the allegations in that Statement of Objection, and we are currently in the process of analyzing the very large amount of data that we received, she said. Were working on this as a matter of priority but we can of course not sacrifice quality over speed.In addition, she said her department is continuing to look atGoogles behavior in other areas where it has received prior complaints (and as part of that longer-running probe)  namely inspecialized search; the copying of third party content; and advertising. Albeit it has clearly been focusing on Android as ahigh priority, given the speed with which the latterinvestigation has progressed. Indeed, Vestager has said as much herself, andmore than once.By comparison, the ECs Google Shopping probe dates back to November 2010  and to the tenure of the prior EC competition commission, Joaquin Almunia  withVestager only takingover the antitrust chief role in November2014. Apparentlyhavingabsorbedcriticism that competition regulators were not keeping pace withtech giants. Or else determined to pick her battles carefully, with a focus on areas where evidence can be amassed to make a case  and make it quickly.It isourobligation to do what we find that we can prove. We have no grudge against any company. We have an obligation to look if a behavior is anticompetitive or is a misuse of a dominant position, she told journalists today. For us it is obviously the duty to be able to prove that. To find the facts, to find the evidence, to prove if were right or wrong  following up on, among other things, a number of complaints.Responding to a question about whether the Commission isapplying competition law disproportionately harshly on U.S. companies  with the impliedcriticism, typically directed at the EC from the U.S., being of regional, protectionist bias Vestager rebutted this by saying: It is not our job to defend companies, it is our job to make sure that there is competition. Competition also to the fact that sometimes companies grow to be dominant, and that is fine The thing is that if dominance is abused then we have an issue.I think there is an obvious reason as to why Google is dominant, and it is not only the behavior that we describe today  its also because some of these products are the preferred products by consumers. And that is all very good. In Europe you can be big, you can grow, you can be dominant. The one thing you cant do is to misuse or abuse your dominate position to stay there and to close off competition, she added.Should Google be found to be in breach of EC competition law,Vestager assertedthe remedy would be quite simple  aka: to stop these practices that we find to be damaging for innovation and competition.Perhaps the more complex question is whether her department can reach a conclusion on Android quickly enough to please complainants/restore any competitive imbalance, shouldthe platform befound inbreach of antitrust law. (She was asked directly how she intended to prevent the investigation dragging on for year after year after year  but had no clear-cut response to that.)She also responded to a question aboutwhy her antitrust departmentis not concerned with how rival mobile OS maker Apple controls itsiOS walled garden (albeit, it does not have anywhere near the dominant marketshare that Android does)  where Apple also pre-loads its own suite of apps and entirely structures the out-of-box experience for consumers.On iOS Vestager said its not a like for like comparison because Apple does not license its operating system as Google does with Android.That is obviously a very categorical difference between the two, she said. We are obliged to look at the things as we see them and not to try to compare two different things.
