Samsungs Tizen mobile platform is all too easy to write off as a failure. The product, which is a Samsung-owned rival to Googles Android and Apples iOS operating systems, was delayed for more than a year. Even when the first Tizen-powered device finally emerged this January, it was a pretty underwhelming $92 smartphonefor India and other emergingmarkets.Added to that,Samsung had earlierextended the platform to cover smart TVs, a move that some took to mean that the platform wouldnthave a major role in its mobile division.This scenarioisntexactly in tune with the hype that, with Tizen, Samsung ishedging its relianceon Android and creating its own platform to assert greater control over the devices it produces and services that it runs on them. Tizen doesntlook like it will challenge Android or iOS for marketshare.But  anyone who read the headline knew this was coming  there is an earlysign to suggest that itmight not be a total disaster after all.A new report from Counterpoint Research suggests that the Samsung Z1, the aforementioned $91 device, was the top-selling smartphone in Bangladesh in Q1 2015. The report did not provide an estimation for the number of sales,but that finding from the report is surprising  to use Counterpoints own description.Yes, Bangladeshs smartphone market isnt anything like the size of that of China or the U.S., but Counterpoints report signals the potential for the phone to compete in emerging markets where the shift to smartphones is still in its infancy and consumers are particularlysensitive to prices.Feature phones still dominate the mobile sales mix in Bangladesh, which has a population of 156 million. Smartphones account for just 21 percent of all phones sold in the country, but  in a sign of where things area heading  smartphone sales in Q1 2015 increased 17 percent year-on-year and that growth rate is likely to increase.The takeaway from this for Samsung, which is the secondbiggest seller of smartphones inBangladesh, is that Tizen couldhave an impact in emerging markets where smartphone adoption remains immature.It is still early days in Bangladesh, and it remains to be seen of the device can continue to sell well, while also Tizen hasnt worked in India, a far bigger smartphone.Samsung reportedly said the Z1clocked 100,000 sales within a month in India to account for just 1 percent of its smartphone sales in the country. That wasapparently higher than expected, but it isnt enough toconcern Google or Apple.Android is the big challengewhen it comes to entry-level smartphones, and it doesntjust rely on Googles Android One program  which expanded to offer $50 handsets inBangladesh in December 2014. This Technology Review articleexplains how cheap, third-party Android devices, some of which are priced below $50, disrupted Mozillas efforts to make a dent with its FireFox OS platform, and that is also a challenge for Tizen in emerging markets.But, Samsungs global brand is a huge selling point for the company in many parts of the world.
