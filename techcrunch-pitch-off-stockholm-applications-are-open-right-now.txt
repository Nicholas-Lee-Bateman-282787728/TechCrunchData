TechCrunch is hitting the road for the Summer and checking out some key global tech hubs to spread our Crunchie love all over you guys.Our world-famous TechCrunch Pitch-Off is a two-piece event. We invite a panel of investor judges to check out the very best startups in each city we visit. Each company has exactly 2 minutes to pitch their startup with no demos allowed.If you want to pitch, make sure to apply here. We will select 8-10 companies to compete. If you dont want to pitch but just want to come along and hang out, get a ticket here.Afterwards, the startups, the investors, the TechCrunch writers, and the wonderful audience get to hang out, throw back a couple of drinks (these are over-21 events), and hang out.The details:TechCrunch Stockholm Meetup + Pitch-off
