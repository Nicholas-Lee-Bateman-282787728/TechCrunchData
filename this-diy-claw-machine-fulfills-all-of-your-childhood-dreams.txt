As any child will tell you there are a few things you want to try every time you see them. When youre young you want to ride on any coin-operated animal or train you see on the street. A few years later and candy machines are the target. Then, when you get older, you want to play the claw machine. And when you play the claw machine you inevitably begin to cry.Fear not, child in you, because this claw machine by Retrobuilt Games is fairer, faster, and better than anything in the arcade. It uses Arduino to control a 3D-cut arm and lets you build your own life-completing game for $470.The creators write:I, for one, welcome anything that saves me $5 every time my 9-year-old sees a claw machine in the arcade.
