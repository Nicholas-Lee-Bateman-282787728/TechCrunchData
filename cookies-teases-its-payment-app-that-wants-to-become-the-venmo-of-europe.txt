Cookies wants to become the Venmo of Europe with a consumer app to pay back your friends in no time and with no fees. The company promises a speedy onboarding experience and a great design. And today, the company is showing a bit more about the app.With the following screenshots, you can see what Cookies is building. Its a messaging-meet-payment app with a lot of emojis.You can send or request money, chat directly inside the app and confirm payments with the Touch ID sensor or a PIN code. Its not groundbreaking if youve been using apps like Lydia in France, but it looks like a polished experience.There are two things that set Cookies apart. The two founders, Garry Krugljakow and Lamine Chelou, met when they were working for Number26, a German fintech startup that has managed to convince more than 100,000 people to open a new bank account.Second, Cookies isnt an e-wallet. You connect your Cookies account with your bank account so that Cookies can withdraw and credit money directly without relying on your credit card. It lets you skip one step and it meansyoure not going to forget about some money you have on your e-wallet.I still believe theres more to see about Cookies. If the startup can integrate in other apps, it could become a seamless and ubiquitous way to pay back your friends. And an API approach makes a lot of sense in the payment space. The service is launching soon and is going to work with all German bank accounts.
