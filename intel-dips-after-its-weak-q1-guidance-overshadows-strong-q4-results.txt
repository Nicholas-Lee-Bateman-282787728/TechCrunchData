Intel reported its fourth-quarter financial performance today, including revenue of $14.72 billion and profit per share of $0.74. Both figures beat expectations: The street had expected $14.70 billion in revenue and $0.66 in profit.But neither the companys narrow profit beat, norits wider profit beat, have sent its shares higher in after-hours trading. Rather, at issue is its first-quarter, 2015 guidance of $13.7 billion in revenue. That is below investor expectation, at current tip, of $13.77 billion. Intel shares are down just under a percent after hours.The companygenerated$5.8 billion in cash during the period, along with net income of $3.7 billion.For the full year, Intel had revenue of $55.9 billion, net income of $11.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.31. The companys revenue is mildly cyclical due to the impact of fourth-quarter holiday shopping. Thats the reason the companys expected sequential revenue decline into 2015 is neither surprising nor worrying. Instead, investors are only quibbling that they had expected a slightly smaller delta between the two periods.Importantly, Intel did meet its goal of shipping 40 million processors for tablets in the year, ending 2014 with a total of 46 million shipped.Looking ahead, Intel expects its revenue to grow mid-single digit percentage points in 2015. At this year, Intel laid out its plan for the year, including a focus on increasingly intelligent computing, and, as with everyone, wearables. Importantly, the company made a commitment to spend $300 million over the next few years to increase the diversity of its workforce.Intels modestly robust report sets the stage for other players in the PC market  Microsoft, AMD, and others. It will be interesting to see if a stabilizing PC market can float more than just Intels boat.
