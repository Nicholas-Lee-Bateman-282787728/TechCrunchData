Google I/O blasted us in the face with news, mostly around the new and improved Android M. Greg was live at the Moscone Center in San Francisco the whole time and reported back to John and I (stuck in New York) as Matt continued the struggle with his microphone. Google Now on Tap, which reads the text on the screen and taps Google Now for relevant info, has Greg jazzed, as does Googles future in VR (exemplified with the revelation of the latest Cardboard VR Viewer). We also chat about the new Offline Google Maps, Android Pay, Google Photos, and all the wonders of being at Google I/O in real life. Youll find all this and more on this weeks episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast featuring Jordan Crook,Greg Kumparak and John Biggs.We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific.
