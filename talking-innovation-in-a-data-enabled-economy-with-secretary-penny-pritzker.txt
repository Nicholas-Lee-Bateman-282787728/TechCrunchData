The value of this data can translate to tens of billion dollars for the American economy on an annual basis.Indeed, according to the Open Data 500 Study, the first comprehensive study of its kind, there are in excess of 500 companies that use open government data to fuel innovative businesses in agriculture, finance, energy, education, healthcare, and many other sectors of the economy.The efforts of Secretary Pritzker and her team go well beyond releasing data, though. The Secretary stressed that there must also be collaboration and partnership between the public and private sectors, standardization and timely accessibility of the data in order to drive maximum value to the business community.She further highlighted that the government is here to serve its key customer, the public, and that the technology community should view the Commerce Department as its partner. I want there to be a recognition in the tech community that the Department of Commerce is your partner when it comes to data and the digital economy, the Secretary said.And, indeed, the private sector has embraced working with theCommerce Department.We have created the Commerce Data Advisory Council which consists of a group of professionals that act like a public companys board of trustees to help identify the priorities for our department including high level Technology executives such as Intels Chief Information Officer, Paypals Head of Data Strategy, and IBMs Chief Information Strategist, said Secretary Pritzker.The startup community isnt ignorant of the benefits of working with the Commerce Department, either. Startups that met with Secretary Pritzker during her visit included Omnity which uses data from the USPTO, BrightBtyes which looks at Census data, Symbiotic Technology and Ecology (STAE), AutoGrid which leverages data releated by NOAA and Arborlight, also relying on data from NOAA.There is a transformationof the Federal Government underway which goes beyond the modernization of systems being used across the government. Italso involves a shift in how government leaders such as Secretary Pritzker, a former CEO herself, are seeking to incorporate private sector best practices and business models.To learn more about how Secretary Pritzker and her team are engaging with the private sector to drive innovation and opportunities to benefit not just the Department of Commerce but commerce overall, listen to the entire interview, Talking Innovation through Open Data with Secretary Penny Pritzker.
