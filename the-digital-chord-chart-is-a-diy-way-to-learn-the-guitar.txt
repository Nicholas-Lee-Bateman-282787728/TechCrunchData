It is my understanding, and correct me if Im off base here, that youre intopia coladas and getting caught in the rain. Furthermore, youre not into yoga and, I suspect this is unrelated but lets not quibble, you have half a brain. And if you like making 3D-printed guitar necks at midnight on your home workbench, then you should probably take a look at this Instructables project.How does it work, you ask? Using a 3D-printed guitar neck, a matrix of LEDs, and some Arduino code, the neck lights up exactly where youre supposed to fret on your real guitar. In this way you can practice each chord pattern or solo progression individually, ensuring you dont miss a single bit of blazing solo and sweet, sweet arpeggio.Created by one MushfiqM, the Digital Chord Chart could be programmed to play almost any song using TAB files that include chords and stylized note representations. While this isnt nearly as powerful as the Firelight, its a clever little hack and should help your learn a song that could impress your significant other, especially if your relationship is like a worn-out recording.So if youre not much into health food and more into champagne, feel free to fire up the printer and soldering iron and make a little guitar that you can take down to OMalleys for a secret rendezvous/practice session. Maybe something funny/ironic will happen!
