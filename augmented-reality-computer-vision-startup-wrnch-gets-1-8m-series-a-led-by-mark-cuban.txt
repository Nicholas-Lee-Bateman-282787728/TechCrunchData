Talk to anyone in the AR space right now and the phrase democratizing x is bound to arise two or three dozen times.Wrnch CEO Paul Kruszewski says that concept is especially true for the computer vision space, with war chest-toting companies like Magic Leap powering their own technologieswhiledramatically smaller teams are left to piecemeal their own solutions.Today, hiscompany, Wrnch, announced a Series A raise of $1.8 million led by Mark Cubans Radical Ventures.Aligo Innovation, gr0k andTandemLaunch Ventures also participated in the round.As a diversified technology investor, I have a ring side seat to watch how AR/VR is set to change the world, said Cuban in a statement. I am excited to help the wrnch become the go-to tool for computer vision development.This funding will allow Wrnch to weather the commercialization phase and prove the business model surrounding their core engine, Kruszewski says.Kruszewski told me that its early enough in the space that not everyone is fully aware of what computer vision is, but he wants to approach their computer vision engine in a manner similar to how Epic Games approached their video game engine, by helping build actualcontent to draw attention to their computer vision engine.Were working withthe various crackerjack computer vision team units on actual production stuff right now,Kruszewski said. People running Wrnchs engine will eventually be able to use it to make mass market Magic Leap kinds of experiences across devices.
