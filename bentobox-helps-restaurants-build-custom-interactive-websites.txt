A decade ago, building a website was a task reserved for professionals and early adopters. Today, however, there are dozens of tools on the market that will help an individual or a small business get a web page up and running. However, there is nothing on the market built specifically for restaurants.But wait! Now theres BentoBox, a tool for restaurant owners to get a beautiful, functional website up for their restaurant quickly and on the cheap.A restaurants website isnt a blog oran e-commerce platform but it still has elements that need to be interactive and other elements that need to be updated, such as the menu. Thats where BentoBox comes in.Restaurants simply head to the BentoBox website and put in some information about their establishment. After a template has been selected, BentoBox takes the project on and delivers a robust website that is customized to the needs of the restaurant. From there, the user has the option to update any part of the site and make changes as necessary.If the restaurant already has a developer that theyre working with, BentoBox has a custom option that will let the coder build the site on the BentoBox developer back-end so that the restaurant can still quickly and easily update the site through BentoBox without having to re-hire a developer each time a change needs to be made.Developers can also build in transactional features  gift cards, for example  and CRM-based tools for booking private parties, taking reservations, and getting feedback. BentoBox currently works with big names like the Union Square Hospitality Group, The Meatball Shop, The Breslin and others with a 100 percent retention rate among clients.The company recently raised a $1.2 million seed round from Female Founders Fund and others.
