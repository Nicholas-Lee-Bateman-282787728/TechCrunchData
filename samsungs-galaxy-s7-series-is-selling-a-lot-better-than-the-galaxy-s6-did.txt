Its become increasing common to hear of Samsungs mobile business struggling, but heres some positive news  early signs around its newest devices suggest that the companymight be returning to times of success.On the back of Samsung forecasting upbeat financials for its upcoming quarter of business, a report from analyst firm Counterpoint Researchsuggests that the first month of sales for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7Edge are 20 percent higher than last years flagship devices.Samsung itself didnt cite any specific factors behind its unexpectedly positive predictions for its Q1 2016 period but, with its latest smartphones fresh on the market, the broad assumption is that the devices areoff to a promising start.Counterpoint conductedinto research across 40 markets which, the firm said, shows that Samsung is seeing up to 50 percent higher sales with its Galaxy S7 series versus last years Galaxy S6 models in some parts of the world. On specific markets: in the U.S., the firm estimates that sales are up 30 percent, in Western Europe that figure is 20 percent, while it is at 10 percent in China. Only Koreahas seen relatively flat growth, Counterpoint said, and that could be down to last years models going down relatively well on home turf, its strongest market.Overall, the firm estimatesthat Samsung has shipped10 million Galaxy S7devicesworldwide thus far, thats 25 percent higher than it estimates for the Galaxy S6 last year after its first month.The immediate thought might be that the devices are more appealing to consumers  Samsung returnedsome popularfeatures left out of the Galaxy S6 family, notable water resistanceand expandable memory options  or that Samsung hit a home run with its marketing. Those may be factors, but Counterpoint argues thatbasic preparation and supply-demand management is key.The company seems to have picked its timing well, launching the Galaxy S7 devices a month earlier than usual while rivals like Apple and other rivals are between devices, andit got its ducks in line on the supply chain side of its business.Last year, the Galaxy S6 Edge was very popular and in high demand, no one was looking at the flat version, Counterpoint Research Director Neil Shah told TechCrunch. However, making those curved edges had low yieldand hence Samsung couldnt supply [demand from consumers] in time and [it]lost the window of opportunity.Fast forward one year and the Edge yields have improved, hence, supply too, he added.In other words, Samsung didnt anticipate that the Galaxy S6 Edge device would draw such attention last year, and that caught it flat-footed whenit wasnt able to fully service demand from customers. This year, that experience helped it increase supply for the Galaxy S7 Edge so it could translatedemand for the device into sales.There are, of course, other factors at play.Shah added that the lack of (perceived) wow factors between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S may also have played into Samsungs hands, too. However, despite earlypromise, he stressedthat Apple is still the company to beat, particularlywhen it comes to the most expensive phones.Overall, the iPhone is still the one which has increased the premium market pie, so Samsung has their work cut out to maintain this momentum, Shah explained.Beyond its halo devices, Samsungs new strategy has seen the company target emerging markets where younger rivals, like Chinas Xiaomi, erodedthe Korean firms dominance with highly competitive and lower priced Android smartphones.Samsung has fired back with its own take, introducing new typesof phonesthat offer a higher quality user experience at a lower price point than it traditionally offered. The Wall Street Journal explains thatthe newGalaxy A, Galaxy E and Galaxy J families offer near-high-end specs at considerably lower prices, and they havehelped Samsung regain the top spot for sales in India and Indonesia, two of Asias most populous countries with fast-growing smartphone markets. China, though, continues to be a tough place for Samsung.
