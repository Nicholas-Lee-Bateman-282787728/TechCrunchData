Wibbitz, a startup that helps online publishers create video summaries of their articles, is announcing its first big push in the U.S. market, starting with partnerships with USA Today Sports, Hearst and ViralNova.Wibbitz analyzes the text of a story, creating a summary thats turned into a voiceover (you can go with a real human or a computer voiceover) accompanied by photos, graphics and other content from the publisher or from Wibbitz partners. You can see a sample video below.Co-founder and CEO Zohar Dayan said this isnt supposed to replace videos created by your editorial team, but to supplement them  after all, for most publishers, the vast majority of articles dont have an accompanying video. Wibbitz makes it easy to change that.Wibbitz says it already works with 70 international publishers. Even with just a few publishers announced in the U.S., the companys videos should appear on more than 35 sites, including Esquire, SFGate and USA Todays digital sports properties.And while Wibbitz still has an office and a team of 25 in Tel Aviv, Israel, it has also opened an office in New York City. Dayan said the new office hasbecome the companys business headquarters, and hes now based in NYC himself.
