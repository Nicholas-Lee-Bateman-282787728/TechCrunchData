When launching a new consumer application, especially those in the social space, many developers today rely on an invite mechanism that has the apps initial user base reaching out and recommending the app to theirfriends. But today, theseinvite systems are often fairly basic  they connect to a phones address book and then force the user to sift through their hundreds of contacts for those they think would be interested in joining the new app, too.AY Combinator-backed startup called YesGraph wants to make these invite and referral systems more intelligent, with a tool for developers that puts the best contacts  meaning those who are most likely to accept an invite  at the top of the list provided to users.The company has also now raised a $1 million seed round led by Bloomberg Beta to fund the services further development.YesGraph was initially founded in summer 2012 byIvan Kirigin, previously head of growth at Dropbox. But earlier, the company was focused on using its core engine to develop a better recruiting system which would help companies find top talent to join their team by highlighting people whocurrent employees already knew.In the months since that products debut, however, YesGraph encountered some challenges. For instance, LinkedIn made changes to its API which limited full access only to approved partners, which put a damper on the growing ecosystem of startups thatleveraged the technology for other purposes, as YesGraph did. In addition, explains Kirigin, theearlier service was something that appealed a lot to fiercely competitive tech companies, but wasnt resonating outside the industry as much.But really, he adds, the idea to put the core engine into use in a new way was simply more compelling. Plus,after talking to a number of companies in the space, he found therewas a lot of demand.Before we wrote a line of code dedicated to spinning out this core engine, we already had some pilot customers lined up to use it, notesKirigin.The way the system works is somewhat complex, but at a high level, it combines a data from a number of sources, including external services like FullContact, as well as information users have already shared with the app. It also takes into account the apps targeted customer base and the apps purpose to make its recommendations.For example, if its a social app for families, then it may want to track down those whose email addresses have the users same last name. Or if its a collaborative app for business users, it may want to locate colleagues who share the same email domain.The requirements for each companys invite system will vary, of course, but the overall goal is to automate the ranking of a users contacts when they invite friends to join an app. So instead of just being presented with a list where all the Aarons are at the top of the recommended contacts, the most relevant contacts are presented first.To make this work, YesGraph has to understand both a users relationship with the contact in question, and it has to understand how good of a match that contact is for the app itself  something which in other industries is referred to as lead scoring.Larger social networking companies already have big teams dedicated to developing sophisticated growth and referral systems like this, but the goal with YesGraph is to expand access to a broader range of companies, from smaller startups up to enterprise level clients.The system will be made available via a developer API  and because its still in private beta, pricing is not yet available. But Kirigin says that, eventually, the company will be able to attribute an apps growth to its recommendations and will charge accordingly.Some of YesGraphsearliest testers include YesGraphs Y Combinator colleagues, and its working withthese customers to figure out where it makes sense to take the service next  whether thats developing SDKs for iOS or Android, or figuring out whatsort of functionality should be included in YesGraphs online dashboard.The dashboard, which is also still under development, will display the products performance. Kirigin says that hes thinking that this dashboardshould be more about offering analysis, instead of something YesGraphcustomers have to configure for themselves to make the service work better.I personally think the responsibilitys on us  building a complex dashboard to tune and target things is like having enough rope to hang yourselfId like to set the bar higher, he says. We should figure out what sort of knobs to turn to make it optimized.In addition the Bloomberg Beta investment, YesGraph is backed by Y Combinator,Michael Birch and other angel investors. The company had alsoraised $1.3 million earlier fromNextView Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Accel Partners, Founder Collective, Quotidian Ventures, Rivet Ventures, Michael Birch, Gustaf Alstrmer, Lance White, Tom Williams, and Adam Gross for its recruiting product in the past.
