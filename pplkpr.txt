Theyve created and tested the idea in similar art projects prior to pplkpr, including us+, Social Turkers, and Conversnitch.McCarthy and McDonald testeda select group of students in an 8-weekresidency at Carnegie Mellon University for the pplkpr project. They logged students emotional responses and stress levels for a week, using theMio wristband.The two manipulated the studentssocial media interactions and monitored reactions to determine if theproject would work.pplkpr is launching just as heart rate monitoring is becoming a standard feature on more fitness trackers and other wearable devices. In addition to Mio, which the company used in its own study, low-cost wristbands with heart rate monitoring built in include the new Fitbit Surge and Charge, the Basis Peak, and even the upcoming Apple Watch.Even if you dont have one of these devices, you can still use pplkpr. You just have to remember to log how you feel about a person on the app each time you interact with them.A video on the pplkpr site says the app will automatically manage your relationships so you dont have to.The overallpromise is to help you spend more time with those who contribute to your well-being and avoid those who stress you out. It does this in a way that aims to excuse you from having to make that sometimes difficult decision yourself.pplkprdoesnt tell you if someone you meet has been blocked by others or if you are actually the one stressing everyone elseout, but it does provide a nice excuse to get away from someone.You can just tell them, sorry, but my app tells me we cant hang anymore.
