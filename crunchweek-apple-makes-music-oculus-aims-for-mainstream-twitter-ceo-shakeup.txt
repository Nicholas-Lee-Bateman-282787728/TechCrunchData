 This time around I was joined by Matthew Lynley and Darrell Etherington to talk about the big takeaways from Apples WWDC conference (one of which was the launch of Apple Music,) the debut of Oculus first consumer-focused Rift VR headset, and the news that Twitter CEO Dick Costolo is stepping down from the helm of the company and handing the reins back to the companys co-founder Jack Dorsey.This is a bittersweet episode for me, since today is my last day at TechCrunch, and Im heading out for new adventures. Working here for the past 3.5 years has been an absolute honor and so much fun, and Ill especially miss the TechCrunch TV team and our CrunchWeek crew. Thank you for watching, and make sure to keep tuning in.
