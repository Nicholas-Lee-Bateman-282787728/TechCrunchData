Caeden, maker of earphones and connected jewelry, is launching a connected bracelet that aims to help you chill out when you need it most. Called Sona, the bracelet helps users improve mind and body wellness through activity tracking.Unlike other activity trackerslike Jawbone or Misfit Shine, the focus is on overall wellbeing instead of weight loss or steps.Sona monitors subtle changes in heart rate to let you know when you feel stressed and the companion app walks you through a designed breathing exercise and meditation program called Resonance to help you slow down. Its also compatible with Apple HealthKit.The bracelet is made of leather and metal with a subtle, screenless design. The look is reminiscent of the stylish Tory Burch Fitbit and is meant to compliment your wardrobe as a fashionable accessory.As mentioned above, Sona comes with a much more detailed heart rate sensor that can track heart rate variability (HRV), as opposed to the standard pulse rate. This allows it to gather information abut your cardiovascular and nervous system, which can provide a better overall view of your health.Sona comes in two sizes  small/medium or medium large  and comes in 3 colors  rose gold with white leather, gunmetal with black leather, and gold with black leather.You can get the bracelet at the pre-order price for $129 for a limited time. Sona will eventually retail for $199.Co-founder Nora Levinson walked me through the product on a recent visit to the TechCrunch studios.
