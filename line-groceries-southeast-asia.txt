Amonth after introducing its own Uber-like service in Tokyo, Line  the Japanese messaging serviceknown for itszany cartoon stickersis taking a first step towards grocery sales and delivery in Southeast Asia, in the styleof U.S. startup Instacart.Beginning in Thailand this week, where itclaims 36 million registered users, Linewilloffer upa range of perishable and non-perishable goods via itsmessaging app. Itis initially testing the concept using a daily deals model, which will includethreedaily deals and twoheavily discounted offers per week, but there are plans to do more over time.The promotionswill be publicizedby three existing Line brand accounts that haveshowcasedpromotionsfor consumer products since last year  in other words, Line users deliberately opt in for the grocery deals, it isnt spam that is sent toall.The longer-term plan here is forLinetobuild out a fuller channel for food (and general) shoppingacross Southeast Asia.Thiscampaign is our first step towards moving into developing our channel exclusively for the emergingonline groceries category. In the future, this platform would display all the regions top food and FMCGbrands in a digital food marketplace integrated with all the ease and convenience of mobile at theconsumers fingertips, said Sedong Nam, who is head of service atLine Plus  the corporations overseasorganization  in a statement.Nam conceded that Line may need to educate both consumers and retailers on the benefits of mobile, in-app, shopping, but this pilot is anotherstep on that journey.Thailand, where Linehas two million more registered users thanFacebook, is its second largest market behind Japan. This is the latest in a range of shopping-themed pilots there, but this test is more indicative of future plans.Last year, Linereleased a shopping app in Thailand and it began offering hot deals and promotions on consumer goods.Previously userscould only complete purchases via the standalone Line Shop app, but now thecompany is allowing paymentinside the core chat appvia itsglobal payment service which went live in December. Cash-on-delivery may be added in the future, were told.Using Line Pay for this trial could boost adoption of the payment services,plus getting users to add their bank details removes a major barrier and unlocksthe potential to sell them more goods and services in the future.Finally, Line is promising free, next-day delivery for all purchases, although the company isnt handling this side of the project.aCommerce  a Bangkok-basedstartup that raised $10.7 million from Docomo and others last summer, and workswith Line on other commerce ventures  will providethe logistics and fulfillment backbone.The launch of Snapchat Discover has given the concept of messaging apps as platforms more credence in the U.S., but Line is one of a number of Asian companiesthat have longbeen plotting services for users. In addition toshopping and taxis, Line is hatching a global music service  having bought MixRadio from Microsoft  while it harborsfood delivery and other online-to-offline commerce ambitions too.Line claims92 million active users across Japan, Thailand and Taiwan, and it seems feasible that a mobile commerce play could work in these markets. But its most recent financial report showed new user growth is slowing, andhalfof its 181 million active users worldwide islocated in those three aforementioned countries.That makes the potential adoption ofregional and global services somewhat uncertain at this point.
