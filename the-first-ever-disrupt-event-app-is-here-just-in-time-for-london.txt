Here at TechCrunch, we want to make Disrupt the best possible experience for our attendees. This includes finding new ways to help attendees discover and stay connected to new people and making it easier for everyone to stay informed. So we are calling on our community to help us build an awesome conference app.For Disrupt London, we will be releasing a beta version of our new Disrupt app and inviting the audience to take it fora test drive.The app will help attendees find and connect with each other via in-app messaging and their social networks, as well as deliver event alerts tailored to each attendees role at the event (e.g. Startup Battlefield contestant, sponsor, attendee, etc). The app will also have a customizable agenda, so users can plan their days around the speakers they want to see most.It is important to us that we build a product that is useful, so were releasing it in a rough, early stage to gather feedback on whats most valuable and what features our beta testers would like to see next.This experiment will only be available to Disrupt attendees. And attendees can only message other attendees who have downloaded the app. So get in there early and dont miss out on people who might be trying to message you right now.If you have already purchased a ticket, you can download the app for iOS and Android. If not, become part of it and help us shape the future of this app by getting your Disrupt London ticket here.Once youve familiarized yourself with the app, dous a solid and give us your feedback here.For any questions, check out the FAQ page.
