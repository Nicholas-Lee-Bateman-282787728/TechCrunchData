Heres a new startup to keep an eye on  Forward, which plansto use sensors and other technology to rethink the healthcare experience.Its hard to say what that means exactly. For now, the Forward website is pretty much a blank sign-up page.But the startup already has more than 30 employees and has enlisteda number of big-deal executives as investors, including Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Box CEO Aaron Levie, StumbleUpon/Uber co-founder Garrett Camp, Thrive Capital/Oscar co-founder Joshua Kushner and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale.We asked another investor, First Rounds Josh Kopelman, about why he backed Forward. Kopelman said:Todays healthcare experience is virtually unchanged from my grandfathers experience fifty years ago. Forward hits the reset button on healthcare with a clear vision to take us into the future using all the technologies healthcare has neglected.sensors, mobile, and AI. Were excited about the team and what theyre out to accomplish!(Also an investor: CrunchFund  which is backed by TechCrunch-owner AOL and, like TechCrunch, was founded by Michael Arrington.)Post-acquisition, Aoun worked on artificial intelligence efforts within Google, but he planned to leave before being persuaded to stay on by CEO Larry Page, with a new job  director of special projects. In that role, Aoun launched Sidewalk Labs, a company under the Alphabet umbrella looking at ways to usetech to improve city living.When we reached out to Aoun for comment, he confirmed that hes left Google and is working on Forward, but he said its too early to offer further details.
