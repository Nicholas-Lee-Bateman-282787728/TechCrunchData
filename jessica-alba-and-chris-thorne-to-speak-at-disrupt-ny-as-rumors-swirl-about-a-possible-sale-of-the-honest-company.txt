Were excited to announce that Jessica Alba and Chris Thornewill be speakingthis May for our first Disrupt in Brooklyn. Alba last appeared atDisrupt SF 2012 whenThe Honest Company was just starting up. At the time,sheand CEO Brian Lee talked about the passion that drives founding a startup. This time around, theres a bit more to talk about.Alba and Lee co-founded the The Honest Company in 2011, having since raised $222 million through four rounds of funding, withthe latest round valuing the company around $1.7 billion  all on the back of personal products the company says are effective, safe and, well, honest.The company reportedly started looking for a public exit in 2015, but that plan might have changed.The Honest Company might be looking to sell instead of going public, citing the coolness of the public markets, according to a report in WWD.Last year at SXSW, when talking to Alba and Lee, interviewer Lindsay Blakely of Inc. pointed out that Lees last two startups, LegalZoom and ShoeDazzle, didnt IPO, so she asked: Will the third time be the charm? Lee replied, I love LegalZoom, I love ShoeDazzle, but The Honest Company definitely has a deeper meaning for us.If the public markets are open, we may or may not take advantage of them, but we dont have to take any one path, he added.Were thrilled to have Jessica andChief Marketing Officer Chris Thorne atDisrupt to talk about the companys path from fledgling startup to a company worth more than a billion dollars and what the plan is going forward.
