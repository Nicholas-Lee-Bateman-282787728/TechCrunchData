Hi. Im Fitz, TechCrunchs newest writer/intern.(West) Philadelphia born and raised, on the computer is where I spent most of my days. Seriously, though.I started playing Power Pete on my first Mac Performa in 1996, and have been obsessed with technology ever since.Fun Fact: Ive camped out for every iPhone launch since 2007, and am only slightly ashamed of it. (Also, I hear Im not the only TC intern to complete such a task.)While Ill be writing from the TechCrunch NYC offices this summer, I go to school in LA at USCs Marshall School of Business.Im planning on covering college startups, Apple, Wall Street, Mobile Apps, FinTech, Bitcoin (yes, I mine my own, and no, I didnt start early enough to get rich), among other things.Feel free to reach out if you are doing something cool in one of these spaces (or anything else interesting). You can find me on Twitter, Instagram, and most other social networks.
