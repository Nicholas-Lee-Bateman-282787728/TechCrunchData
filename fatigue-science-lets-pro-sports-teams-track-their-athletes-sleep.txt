As wearable activity trackers get increasingly smart and complex, Fatigue Scienceis measuringone thing and one thing only  how we sleep.Fatigue Sciences Readiband looks very similar to a Fitbit or Nike Fuelband. It has a 3D accelerometer that tracksmovement, impact, velocity, speed and frequency, a battery that lasts 60 days between charges, and its both water and pressure resistant.The band alone is not a revolutionary development, considering that even the most basic wearable fitness trackers can monitor when youre asleep.Fatigue Science has the abilityto detect sleep quality at 93 percent of the accuracy of a hospital sleep lab, but the real feat is theirability to predict human effectiveness and reaction time. The startup takes the sleep data captured by the bandand runs it through abiomathematical model developed by the U.S. Military.This level of accuracy may not be essential for most of us, but for eliteathletes who are requiredto be in topphysical condition, understanding quality of sleep and how it affects performance can be a game changer (literally).TheSeattle Seahawks, the Seattle Mariners, the New York Giants and the Dallas Mavericks are among agrowing groupof pro sports teams that havetheirplayers wearing the Readiband atnight.With Fatigue Sciences TeamPlatform, a dashboardthat aggregates data collected from all players wearing the band, coaches canmake informed decisions about training and scheduling to make sure athletes are fully rested at game time.If the Seahawks, for example, have to cross multiple time zones to go play in New York on Sunday night, they need to be able to plan in advance the right amount of sleep for their players so at game time theyre playing their best, says Fatigue Science CEOSean Kerklaan.If management can determine that the travel schedule affects their players ability to be ready for practice the next morning, maybe they should cancel that practice, he says.By aggregating individual sleep data across an entire sports team, doctors and coaches can analyze how long it takes for players, on average, to fall asleep after a game, how much the team is sleeping when they have days off compared to when theyre playing and traveling, and how all of this effects game-time performance.Kerklaantells me that the U.S. Mens National Soccer team used the band to measure which players were mature about their sleeping habitsbefore going to the World Cup in Brazil this year.And professional sports is only one application of this technology. Fatigue Science has partnered with construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar to prevent employees from operating heavy machinery when theyre sleep deprived.For the time being, the company is solely focused on tracking sleep and fatigue, butit plans toopen its API in the near future so that users can plug in data from other sensors.We get a lot of questions about pulse, heart rate, sweat and other sensors, says Kerklaan. Our position is that none of thatis scientifically valid for helping you understand how fatigued you are, but our API willenhance that research and correlation.Fatigue Science closed $3 million in seed fundinglast Fall from a handful of strategic angels, and Kerklaan says theyre taking their time raising aSeries A because the business is cash-flow positive.
