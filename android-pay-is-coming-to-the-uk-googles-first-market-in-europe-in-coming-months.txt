Now signing up 1.5 million users each week in the U.S., Android Pay, Googles payment platform and mobile wallet for Android devices and apps, is coming to the UK, with dozens of partners including banks, physical retailers, apps and payment platforms in tow. Google is not giving an exact date for the launch except to note that it will bein the next few months. This is Googles first market in Europe, and it looks like its the second outside of the U.S., after Google announced thelaunch of Android Pay in Australia in December(where it has yet to go live).Meanwhile, over in the U.S., Google is adding more retailers and kicking off a new loyalty program for Android Pay users, in partnership with Plenti  a card-based rewards program from American Express. Users of Android Pay who sign up to Plenti can now pick uployalty points and redeem rewards when they shop at participating retailers. Considering that one of the issues with mobile payments is that in many cases people cannot find enough of a reason to switch from using existing payment methods like physical cards, its integrations like this with loyalty programs that can potentially help make services more sticky and potentially more useful.For context on the UK announcement, Apple Pay launched in the UKin Julylast year, and Samsung has saidthat its own-brand mobile wallet will be coming to the UK this year. People had been noticing hints of Android Paysimminent UK plans,but this is the first official confirmation from Googleof the service.In a sense, considering that Apple made an earlier move to turn on Apple Pay here, and individual banks like Barclayshave put in legwork to build their own mobile wallets and contactless payment apps, Google is somewhat late  or at least took its time bringing Android Pay to this market.One of the reasons may have been that it was trying to get a sufficient number of partners on board to enter with a splash. Today, that seems one of the main themes of its announcement.Included are eight big banks  but not all of them, with some of the biggies left out including Barclays and TSB. (Notably, when Apple Pay launched people pointed out that it, too, was missing some major names  which then got in the months following.)Googles Pali Bhat, a product management senior director at Android Pay, notes thatmore banks are still getting added.As for retailers, the launch list includes 11 brands, including drugstore chainBoots, Costa Coffee, Waitrose and Starbucks, as well as the London transport network to let people use Android Pay on the Tube network, buses and city trains.Android Paylate last year also started integrating with apps, so some of the biggies that were already working with Google on this are now extending support to the UK, along with some new additions. They include food delivery startup Deliveroo (theUKs answer to Postmates), fast fashion chain Zara and JD Sports.Similarly, there are a number of payment providers also working with Google, including Hollands Adyen, Klarna, and Stripe.Last year,when Android Pay was made public,payment giants like Visa Europe weighed in with their support.Google also announced that it would be adding more retailers and apps toAndroid Payin the U.S. extending the service to millions of new locations. New additions include Best Buy, Peets Coffee & Tea, and Rubios in addition toEat24, Eventbrite, and Ticketmaster, on top of the loyalty program withPlenti.
