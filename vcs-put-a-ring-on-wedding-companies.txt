Ritani, a tech-enabled jewelry brand, has pulled in$15 million from Cantor Venturesto bring engagement ring shopping into the 21st century.Over the last 10 years, over a third of all existing independent retailers in the jewelry industry have gone out of business. The reality is that this millennial customer is coming of age and has a driving need thats different, says Brian Watkins, Ritanis CEO.Using Ritanis online platform, customers can virtually build engagement rings specific to style and price point.Instead of purchasing thering immediately, users canhaveitshipped to a local retailer, free of charge, to examine in person.This isan industry where the product has a certain level of touch, says Jed Kleckner of Cantor Ventures.Even though online has advantages, it will never replace certain elements of offline, like service, cleaning, and the trust and reputation factor that a local vendor provides, Kleckner says.Ritani has partnered with over 200 local jewelry retailers, whichare happy to showcase Ritani products so they can tap into theonline-focused customer base.After buying an engagement ring, 50 percent of the time that consumer buys their wedding band from the same store  so you have an immediate follow-up purchase, says Watkins.And quite frankly, most guys are pretty lazy, so theyll go back to the same store for each anniversary, he says.If a customer decides not to purchase the ring, Ritani sends the diamond back to itsmanufacturing facility and melts down the metal  a minimal cost compared to the profit margins on engagement rings averaging $8K. Ritani brought in$50 million in sales in 2014, andtheyreup 100 percent through Q1 of this year.
