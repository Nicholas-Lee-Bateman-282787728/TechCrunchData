Each week, John Biggs and I head up to the Sirius XM studios for the TC Radio show on Insight 121. We discuss the latest in tech news and then dive straight into the TC Radio Pitch-off, where five companies have exactly one minute to impress a panel of judges. Its a win-win situation. Startups get a chance to build up awareness of their products, we get to learn about the latest hot products in tech, and our listeners get a list of potential new apps/products to acquire. But in order to make it happen, we need startups to apply for the Pitch-Off. The shows airs every Tuesday at 6pm ET/3pm PT on Sirius XM Insight 121. Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome.
3. You must be able to pitch your product with your words only.
4. You must be able to operate a telephone.Apply:Apply here.Its going to be a hoot!
