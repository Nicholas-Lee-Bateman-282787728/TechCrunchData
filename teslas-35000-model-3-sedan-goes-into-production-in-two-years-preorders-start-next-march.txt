Its happening! You, yes you (and me!), might be able to afford a Tesla sometime soon. On Twitter today, Musk shared that the Holy Grail of Teslas, the lower cost Model 3 sedan, will officially be unveiled next March (along with taking preorders).@elonmusk $35k price, unveil in March, preorders start then. Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 2, 2015Weve known about it since last year, but now we know when to keep an eye out for it.At the time, Musk said [The Model 3] will be way different from any other car on the road. But, in a way thats really useful and just doesnt feel like a weird-mobile. Whatever that means, I want it.If you reserved one of the sexy Tesla SUVs (Model X), you can start customizing it now. While were talking about Tesla, in case you missed it, the Model S broke some consumer satisfaction records, as well.For the rest of us, start saving your pennies for the Model 3 now.
