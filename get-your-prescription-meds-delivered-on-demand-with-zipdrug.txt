While on-demand startups have made it easy to get your food delivered or clothes washed, there has yet to be acompany that lets you skip the monthly 45-minute wait in the pharmacy line.Just launched in NYC, Zipdrug is a on-demand prescription drug delivery servicethat will bring you your meds with the tap of a button.The first time usersboot up the app theyare prompted to enter the pharmacy where theirprescription has been sent by theirdoctor, as well as payment and insurance information.The companythen dispatches messengers to pick up your medicine, all of which have been through a background check, drug screening, and a HIPAA awareness course.All pharmacy payments are handled by Zipdrugs,so your card is just charged the cost of the medications after insurance deductions, plus a $10 delivery fee.Because of the Zipdrugspharmacy-agnostic approach, users cankeep their existing pharmacy and still maintain a relationship with their current pharmacist.Notably, the company wont deliver a small group of controlled substances, including pain narcotics, seizure medication, and ADD stimulants. Everything else is fair game though, including monthly refills.While here are some companies that operate on a similar premise like PillPack,this is the first to offer an on-demand model for prescriptions written same day.Zipdrug is the first investment out ofNotation Capital, a new Brooklyn based fund started by Nicholas Chirls. Other investors include CollaborativeFund and Red Sea Ventures.The app can be downloaded from the iOS App Store now, and will soon be expanding to other cities beyond NYC.
