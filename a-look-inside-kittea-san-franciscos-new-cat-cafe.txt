Online culture has been obsessed with cats since the Japanese text board 2channel first posted Giko Neko in 1998.Cat cafes have capitalized on this obsession and brought us a cache of cats in real-life locations all over the world. What started as a Japanese phenom has already spawned a couple of cat-themed cafes in Silicon Valley  one in Oakland and anotherin San Jose.
