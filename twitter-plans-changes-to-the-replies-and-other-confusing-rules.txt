Twitter can be an incredibly confusing service for new and existing users, and Twitter says its now planning to address some rules that might make it unwieldy.In the companys letter to shareholders, Twittersaid that changes were coming to rules like the @reply and the .@name syntax. We dont know what that looks like just yet, but that the company plans to address that seems significant and in-line with what the company has tried to do lately  make the service less confusing and more palatable to more casual and new users.We have some really weird rules around conversations, around replies and .@name format that no one understands. We need to fix that, CEO Jack Dorsey said on the earnings call. We are focusing a lot of our energy on refining the core product and looking at what is confusing about the service.Heres what it says in the shareholder letter:This, in theory, will at least address the Twitter Canoe problem  as more and more people pile into a conversation, their @reply handles take up characters so each persons reply has be shorter and shorter until its basically impossible to convey complex thought.Many think that @names shouldnt take up character counts in replies. If Twitter made this change, people would always have 140 characters to use in their discussion no matter how many people are part of the thread.As more people join an @ reply thread, their handles take up more of the 140 character limit until people can only add tiny responsesTwitter reported its fourth-quarter earnings today where user growth was flat, and excluding SMS fast followers user growth, core Twitter actually fell. That means Twitter has to do whatever it can to make it easier for new users to understandso it can revitalize growth.Heres a video rant about why small changes like these wont fix Twitters problem
