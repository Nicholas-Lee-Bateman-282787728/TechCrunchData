Many of Katy Perrys 89 million Twitter followersthe most on the platformwere probably intrigued and confused when the pop star tweeted supposed archnemesis Taylor Swift this morning. As it turns out, that tweetalong with several others that were filled with profanity and slurswas the work of a hacker and quickly deleted.It appears Katy Perrys Twitter  with her more than 89 million followers  has been hacked pic.twitter.com/VmTVKJYGqj Ryan Parker (@TheRyanParker) May 31, 2016Those tweets followed one that said haha follow @sw4ylol #hackersgonnahack. That account, which is still active, claims to be based in Romania and sent its first tweet on May 29. It also tweeted a link to a SoundCloud song supposedly by Katy Perry, which was taken down after a copyright claim by Universal Music Group.Lol. pic.twitter.com/DfqUOjE45Z sway (@sw4ylol) May 31, 2016This incident is yet another reminder that despite the platforms security measures, no ones Twitter account is safeespecially if they are a celebrity. Other high-profile Twitters that have been hacked include Justin Bieber, Lea Michele, and Britney Spearsand even the U.S. Central Command.Earlier this month, Tumblrsaid it recently found out about a 2013 data breach and required users to reset their passwords. One security researcher estimates it may have affected 65 million users (theres no indication that data breach and the Katy Perry account hack are related).TechCrunch has contacted Katy Perrys reps and Twitter for comment.
