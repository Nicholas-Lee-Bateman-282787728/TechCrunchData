Whether theyre actually fully safe or not yet for your own joyriding, Googles self-driving cars are pretty damn cool. It looks like people other than Googlers and journalists will get to take a look, as the company has shared that Austin, TX is first to get a visit.Why Austin? BBQ.
 Its pre-prepped with Googly infrastructure thanks to its Fiber project and multiple offices
 Its a smallish city
 The mayor is stoked: We welcome the Google self-driving car team for this next phase of their testing and look forward to seeing them around town.

 Austin is pretty open to new tech
 It has no heavy press presence to scrutinize the sexy cars.In other words, Austin is pretty safe.According to the link that Google sent us Austin American-Statesman, the company already sent a car (a Lexus RX450h) to Austin to drive the city streets with two safety drivers monitoring its route, to make sure everything is hunky-dory. Another car (a Lexus hybrid) is on its way to ride around for testing purposes.Whats cool is that the safety drivers are filling up Googles database with tips like how high a curb is or whether theres a keep-clear zone or other situation that Google Maps or Streetview hasnt picked up. However, if they have to send a team out a few weeks in advance of unleashing a car in a city, how long will it take to micro-map the whole country? Anyways, progress is being made.Jennifer Haroon, head of business operations for Googles self-driving unit asked the city for help:Keep it weird for us, Austin, and visit our website to let us know how were driving.This should be interesting. I propose the hashtag #lookmomnohands for Instagram, Austineers.Where will the cars pop up next? Maybe in other cities where Google Fiber lives: Atlanta, Charlotte, Kansas City, Nashville, Provo, RaleighDurham and Salt Lake City.
