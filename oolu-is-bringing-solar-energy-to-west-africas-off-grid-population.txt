In rural West Africa,150 million peopleare currentlyliving without electricity.Oolu, a Y Combinator company launching today, aims to reduce this number by delivering affordable solar energy to West Africas off-grid population, beginning in Senegal.Despite the surge ofinnovationin solar storage and paneltechnology, Oolu founder Daniel Rosa says that many people living in rural areasof West Africa still walk miles to the nearest city to charge their cellphones and purchase kerosene for lanterns.According to Rosa, the average rural family spends around $20 per month on energy-related costs. Considering that Senegals GDP per capita was just over $1,000 in 2012,thisis a huge expense for many families.Oolus in-home solar system is composed of three adjustable lights and two USB plugs, powered by a battery that holds a charge for up to six hours withmaximum output.For a low monthly fee, Oolu will install the system and perform all necessary maintenance, including free battery replacements and system upgrades.The company is not disclosing itsexact prices (and itanticipates the cost to differ slightly by region), but Rosasays that Oolu has been able to save families an average of 60 percent on total energy spending.These communities are, by and large, farmers of cash crops, says Rosa. The average Senegalese family is very large  the average household size is ten people  so each family has several cellphones that they need to charge twice a week.Oolus innovation isnt the technology behind the solar products that theyre dispensing. The systems are produced by a large manufacturer, and similar products are already being used in areas of East Africa.Instead, the companystrue featis setting up a distribution model and payment infrastructure that West African families and community leaders are comfortable with. Oolu has partnered with Orange Money, a Senegalese money transfer company, so that customers can pay the monthly subscription fee from their mobile phones.Were working with Orange Money to bring not only solar, but also mobile payments and mobile banking to millions of rural people, says Rosa. People talk about a solar revolution, but really its a solar mobile revolution.Prior to starting Oolu, Rosas co-founderNilmi Senaratna worked with children in a rural region of Senegal throughthe Canadian International Development Agency.We were tutoring these kids at night, using flashlights and very bad quality lanterns and candles to study, Senaratna says. We would even use the dim light of a cellphone to study at night.Senaratna began thinking about ways to bring modern technologyto communities that are very hesitant to trust outsiders. Thats why thecompanys name,Oolu, is a word in the local language Wolof that translates to trust.Rural people are very used to being let down because so many organizations come in and promise wonderful things and then they dont deliver, says Senaratna. Our name speaks to the fact that were holding ourselves to a very high standard; when we say well be back with enough systems for your whole community in a week, we do that.Oolu has employed a team of 10 people, working on the ground in Senegal, to communicatewith clients in-person and aid in the installation of systems.After a year-long pilot, the companyhas signed up 500 clients in Senegal. Rosa and Senaratna say theyexpect to reach1500 clients by the end of the summer, and theyre planning to launch in another French-speaking West African country in the near future.And in-home solar systems are just the beginning. Oolu plans to eventually offer a variety of products, from agricultural technology to consumer electronics, to rural West African families using its combination of mobile payments and on-the-ground community support infrastructure.The reason why we got into this business in the first place was to work with rural communities to find ways to provide them the technology they really need, says Rosa. Its not just about solar, we really hope to impact these communities beyond that by bringing modern services to rural people.
