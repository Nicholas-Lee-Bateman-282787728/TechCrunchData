Twitters latest step in the tricky balancing act of championing free speech without also handinga free pass toorchestrated harassment via its platform is the announcement today that its formed a Trust & Safety Council comprised of multiple external organizations with various interests in the two issues.The company said todaythat the Twitter Trust & Safety Council willprovide input on our safety products, policies, and programs.Twitter works with safety advocates, academics, and researchers; grassroots advocacy organizations that rely on Twitter to build movements; and community groups working to prevent abuse, it adds.Ina blog announcing the move,Patricia Cartes, TwittersHead of Global Policy Outreach, writes that a multi-layered approach is necessary to ensure people can continue to express themselves freely and safely on Twitter.As we develop products, policies, and programs, our Trust & Safety Council will help us tap into the expertise and input of organizations at the intersection of these issues more efficiently and quickly. In developing the Council, we are taking a global and inclusive approach so that we can hear a diversity of voices from organizations, she adds.At this inaugural point, Twitter has more than 40 organizations signed up to itscouncil  including Feminist Frequency, the organization of feminist media critic AnitaSarkeesian (one of several high profile women who have suffered abuse via Twitter). Other listed groups includetheInternet Watch Foundation, which works to combat child abuse online; counselling organization the Samaritans; and the Anti-Defamation League, which works to combat anti-Semitism. Other organizationsinclude anti-domestic violence, anti-bullying and anti-hate speech groups.Weve reached out to Twitter to ask for more details on how the council will work in practice and will update this post with any response.The Councils page links to Twitters policies, where it notes:we dont tolerate violent threats or Tweets that promote violence. We also prohibit content that threatens or promotes violence or terrorism against a person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age or disability.A year ago, Twitters then CEO Dick Costolo wrote an internal memo to staff sayingwe suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform. Since then Twitter has taken a series of steps aimed at improving how it deals withharassment and abuse  including moves to automaticallyidentify and limitthe spread of abusive tweets,andsimplify the threat reporting processfor users. It has also made changes to the anti-harassment tools it offers users.The formation of a trust & safety council is a welcome step, although it remains to be seen how Twitter will tap the collective wisdom of such a large and diverse group of organizations in practice  and how that intel will end up shaping its policies. But its certainly a positivemove and a better approach to a nuanced problem than early years Twitter, which preferredto proclaim the tweets must flow when faced with questions about the limits of free speech.A global platform thatseeks to contain and channelmyriad points of view needs a more matureunderstanding of multiple perspectives on speech and asking 40+ variedorganizations to weigh in is certainly one way to achieve that.Twitter isalso one of the tech platforms that recentlyagreed to work fasterto fighthate speech in Germany, as the government thereworks to combat a spike in racist sentiments being expressed online following a rise in the number of refugees entering the country. So its seen the pressure being applied on Facebook, for example, which had been facing investigation by the German government for not doing more to combat hate speech on its platform.Facebook is now working with local Internet safety organizations in Germany to improve its response there, much like Twitter is now doing on an internationallevel by looping inmultiple relevant stakeholder organizations in an advisory capacity.
