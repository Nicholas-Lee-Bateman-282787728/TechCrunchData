JFDI Asia, the Singapore-based accelerator program, is doubling down its investment in early-stage startups and experimenting with allowing participantsof its 100-day programto spend time away fromits physical base.The organization, which was founded in 2012 by former BBC producer Hugh Mason and entrepreneur Meng Weng Wong, said it will now provide an immediate SG$50,000 (US$37,000) investment for startups accepted into its twice-annual program. That covers an 8.88% share in each company, and isdouble its previous investment. JFDI Asia is also pledging to offer a furtherSG$70,000 (US$53,000) towards a follow-on seed round for the mostsuccessful startups.Mason told TechCrunch that the increased funding comes in response to the development ofAsias startup ecosystem over the past few years, and also for practical purposes.Valuations are going up, and were seeing more mature businesses, he added, explaining that JFDI Asia is retaining the same amount of equity for itsinitial investment. As for the follow-on money, we would like to be able to participate in seedrounds where teams are very successful.It typically takes our graduate companies three to five months to close a round once they leave our program. That initial SG$25k would get them through the program [and cover the cost living in Singapore], but then we found a lot were struggling to bridge the financial gap before they closed a round  giving them more security is important, he further explained.Equally as interesting as the increased capital and valuations, JFDI Asia is experimenting with video and online-based learning and mentoring to enable teams to spend time participating in its program remotely.Some of this, Mason explained, comes down to cost  life in Singapore is comparatively more expensive than other parts of Asia where mostof the founders of startups accepted into the program arefrom.Mason values the face-to-face element of accelerator programs above all else, though  were not about to throw that away,he said, pointing out that Singapore is Southeast Asias business and investment hub  but teams will be allowed to spend some time away from JFDI Asias base. He admitted also that the organization, which he said regularly fields partnership requests from across Asia, maylook intoproviding a blended offline/online experience and perhapsaffiliate camps or programs in other markets in the future.Its an experiment, he said. The truth is Singapore is very expensive.JFDI Asias moveto incorporate remote elements came about after the organization embraced Slack, which has now replaced all internal email and other digital communication. Not only has it allowed JFDI Asias startups to increase their meaningful communication with each other, Mason said, but it enabledthe organization itself to create a community to keep tabs oncompanies that applied but are not quite ready for its program.A100-day program has a beginning, a middle, and an end, Mason told us. But if you run a marathon you do pre-event training and keep in touch with those you ran with  similarly, social media allows us to extend the period that were in touch with companies both before and after, which makes the 100 days more effective.JFDI Asia has seenmore than 50 startups graduate from its program. Some of its most notable alumniincludes TradeGecko, which recently raised a $6.5 million Series A, Flocations, which was acquired by Japans VRG, and medical/health startupsHealint andOurHealthMate.The organizationis currently taking applications for its next 100-day program, which is scheduledfor the third quarter of 2015.
