Earlier this week I jumped on a call with Asi Sharabi (pictured third from left above), co-founder and CEO of London-based startup Lost My Name, the self-described full-stack publisher that makes personalised pictures books for kids.In the interview (which over-ran somewhat!) we talked in-depth about how Lost My Name went from side project to a company with a multimillion dollar valuation, how the startup sold over 700,000 books in two years, and fund-raising with Google Ventures.We also discussed Lost My Names latest product  The Incredible Intergalactic Journey Home  which claims to be the most technologically ambitious kids picture book ever!You can listen to the lightly edited interview below.
