Turns out the Ballmer Peak is real.Shares in Twitter spiked 4.85 percent today, closing at $31.15 per share. Tradingabove the $30 mark is an important psychological threshold for Twitter. Put another way, as $40 is to Microsoft, $30 is to Twitter.What happened? Former Microsoft CEO and current eccentric sports fan Steve Ballmer announced that he has acquired a 4 percent minority stake in the social company. That news, coupled to the modestlyebullient reception of fired former CEO Jack Dorseys returnto that role once againweresufficient tender for a fresh rally.TWITTERERS.

In case you were curious, 4 percent of, say, $20 billion is $800 million. That means that Ballmers bet is no small wager  its a stiff investment. He can afford it, of course, but that doesnt diminish the implied confidence that Ballmer has in Twitter.Jokes aside, having both Ballmer and SaudiPrince Alwaleed Bin Talal pickup stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars is good news for Twitter; patient investors can a lower beta make.
