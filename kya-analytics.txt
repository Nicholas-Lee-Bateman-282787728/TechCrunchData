The K-Y-A in KYA Anlytics stands for Know Your Audience, and founder and CEO Jeff Weisbein said thats exactly what hes trying to help online publishers do.Weisbein has been in those shoes himself, having created and run the tech site BestTechie for more than a decade (though he took some time away from it to work as an analyst at Mashwork, now known as Canvs.tv). While there are many analytics products out there, he argued that theyre missing something crucial.Theyre good at numbers, but oftentimes theres a lack of context to those numbers, Weisbeinsaid. For example, you could look at an article and see that it has 10,000 pageviews, but does that mean your audience enjoyed that piece of content, or do they click on it and leave?Heshardly the only analytics maker talking about looking beyond clicks and pageviews. In Weisbeinscase, this basically means trying to provide more information about who your audience is and what theyre interested in.So KYA gives publishers a KYA score  a number between 1 and 100 indicating how engaged their audience is compared to other sites. It also allows publishers to compare the performance of individual pieces of content, and to see demographic profiles of different audience segments.KYA collects its data, in part, through a Facebook-connected Shout Button, which users can click to indicate they liked an article. Thats useful for publishers who get a more nuanced sense of what readers are responding to, and to the reader, who gets personalized content recommendations.Plus, publishers can share these numbers with advertisers, making a stronger case that theyve got an audience thats engaged around certain topics.Founded in 2014, KYA Analytics currently works on WordPress sites. It offers both free and paid options, based on audience size and features.
