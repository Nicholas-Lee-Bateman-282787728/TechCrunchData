The tech industry came under fire at the 9th Annual Crunchies Awards on Monday night  an eventwhich aims to celebrate the best and brightest companies, founders and investors from the startup world. The eventshost, Brooklyn Nine-Nine co-star, actress, writer and comedian Chelsea Peretti, opened the evening with barbs aimed at the industrys lack of diversity, and the failings of various on-demand businesses, like Uber and Postmates.Perettididnt take it easy on the crowd  kicking things off with off-color remarks, and referring to the audienceas filled with theone percent and rich white men.I hate all white men, said Peretti. Sorry everybody here.The irony was that this years Crunchies Awards made an effort to focus on diversity, with the addition ofthe first-ever award for diversity, the Include Diversity Award. The awardwent to the person who has made the biggest contributions to advancing diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. (Kimberly Bryant of Black Girls Codewon the inaugural award later in the night.)But as Peretti noted, the industry sometimes misses obvious opportunities to advance the causes it otherwiseseems to tout.They asked me to speak on the issue of diversity in tech world, saidPeretti. Let me float out a kooky idea: hire a non-white host.Also targeted in her opening bit was the on-demand economy, which included barbs atUber for its crazy drivers (recruited from mental hospitals, she said) and its oddredesign.Peretti joked that the Crunchies should only have one category: viable business. This category should be Apple, Google, Facebookand maybe Uber if they get this logo design thing under control.Postmates was skewered as well  for being late and bringing her cold food.Fastest-rising startup, said Peretti of Postmates, referring to the category the startupwas nominated in. Depends on what you think fast is.Uber later won the award for the best overall startup, after which Peretti apologized for some of her earlier remarks, adding more sincerely that companies like Uber and Postmates had changed her life. Im worried the apps will just be gone from my phone, she confessed.
