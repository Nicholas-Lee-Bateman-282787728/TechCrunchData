Today is a good day for freedom of speech in India. The countrys Supreme Court struckdownanambiguous law that couldbe used to imprison citizens for content they post online.NDTV reportsthatSection 66A of the Information Technology Act was declared unconstitutional at a session held this morning. The court added that the controversial law, which first came into existence in 2000, is vague in its entirety and in violation of existing free speech laws.Quick refresher, this is what Section 66A actually is:66A. Punishment for sending offensive messages through communication service, etc.Any person who sends, by means of a computer resource or a communication device,(a) any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character; or(b) any information which he knows to be false, but for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will, persistently by making use of such computer resource or a communication device,(c) any electronic mail or electronic mail message for the purpose of causing annoyance or inconvenience or to deceive or to mislead the addressee or recipient about the origin of such messages,shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine.As you can see, it is highly ambiguous, to the point that Indias formerInformation and Broadcasting Minister has even admitted that it isoften misused.Achallenge was filed against the law in 2012 when studentShreya Singhal pressed for an amendment followingthe arrest of two girls over a Facebook post.Shaheen Dhada used the social network to criticize the shutdown of Mumbaifollowingthe death of politician Bal Thackeray.Her friendRinu Shrinivasans crime was to click the Like button below saidstatus update.A court later rescinded charges against them, butSinghal had already jumped on the case to push for reform.Nobody should have fear of putting up something because of the fear of going to prison, Singhal said in a comment today.In its ruling today, the court did not strike down the website blocking powers ofSection 66A, however, according to DNA. It isnt entirely clear how that will shake down, but it doesleave the possibility that the law can still be used to censor websites.The ridiculousnessof state-ordered censorship wasmade very obviouslast December when the Indian government ordered 30 websites, including Github, Vimeo and Archive.org, to be blocked by ISPs. India has also dueled with Google, Facebook and Twitter in the past over restricting content in the country.Data released by Facebook this month showed that Indias government made the second highest number of requests for user informationfrom the social network during the second half of 2014. While the volume of requests from the U.S. and UK governments dipped, India lodged more in H2 2014 than in the first half of the year.
