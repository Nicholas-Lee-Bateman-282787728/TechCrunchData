Dashlane, a password manager application that competes with the likes of 1Password and LastPass, among others, has just rolled out a significant update which not only gives the software a new look-and-feel, but also makes it capable of automatically updating your passwords on over 500 websites, thanksto the additional support for 300 more sites included in this release.The introduction of DashlanesPassword Changer first took place in late 2014, following numerous data breaches that saw user information pilfered from major companies, including retailers like Target, Home Depot, Staples, Neiman Marcus, and more. Combined with large-scale security incidents like Heartbleed, web users were continuallyasked to change their account passwords after these types of incidents occurred.However, not only is changing your password a bit of a hassle, its also difficult to remember if that password had been used on other sites. (Many peoplere-use their same passwords on more than one site, of course.) Thats where Dashlanes Password Changer came in  with a click of a button, you could automatically change your password on a number of sites, and have the new one stored in the app for future use.In making this feature work on a much larger number of websites, Dashlanes software nowbetter protects its users.While that may be the most important of the under-the-hood improvementsin the new release of Dashlane 4, its not the only change. The updated app also received a visual overhaul that now delivers a more consistent experience across platforms, including both on devices and the web.This redesign includes a number of features and tweaks, such as a new list and grid view, new sorting options, improved button and header labeling, and a new Quick Actions menu from the in-app search field that lets you get to the data you need more easily  that is, you can just search instead of clicking and scrolling.Another update includes an improvement to Dashlanes Secure Notes section  which is a better alternative to writing down critical info in the native Notes app on your phone. (Something many people do, apparently, as Apples iOS 9.3 beta has added support for locking this app with a passcode or fingerprint.)Now, the Secure Notes section offers templates for the type of info youre saving, includingApps, Databases, Financial documents, Legal documents, Memberships, Service info, Software licenses, and Wi-Fi passwords.And you can now add a note to your credit and debit cards  a feature many users requested.The company also added over 618banks and financial institutions in Dashlane Payments, the softwares digital wallet that lets you fill out forms on checkout pages and save receipts with just a click.Plus, while Dashlane already reaches over 4 million users in over 200 countries, its still working in becoming a more global product. To that end, it rolled out support for five more languages,Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, and Japanese in the browser, desktop and mobile applications. That brings Dashlane to a total of 7 languages, given its prior support for English and French.On iOS devices, Dashlane expanded the list of apps that work with its software, allowing mobileusers to instantly login to app accounts with Touch ID. Today, it now supports over 180 mobile apps for both login and account creation.Though Dashlane is not the only password manager on the market, it has the potential to eat up more market share following the acquisition of LastPass by LogMeIn last fall, for $110 million. Many LastPass users were wary, if not downright angry, to see their preferred password manager program transferred to a company that had a bad reputation with regard to managing its acquisitions, in their eyes.That could leave a sizable group of customers on the lookout for an alternative  something Dashlane is also addressing with this release, which includes an improved onboarding experience for new users.Dashlane is free software for use on one device, but its worth the $39.99 annual fee to sync passwords across an unlimited number of devices.
