Farmigo, a startup rethinking the local farmers market, has raised $16 million in series B funding.Founder and CEO Benzi Ronen said the company started out by building software for farmers, but its focus has shifted to a consumer marketplace where you can order farm-fresh groceries, then pick them up from local food communities, such as a nearby school or office. (Farmigo launched one of its products at our Disrupt conference back in 2011.)Ronen suggested that this makes for a convenient alternative to a farmers market  many consumers dont live near one of those markets, or dont have time to shop there every week. He said it also offers more choice and variety than community supported agriculture programs, which follow more of aone-to-one model, where the buyer ends up with whatever food the farm has produced that week.There have been some big successes in the food tech industry, like Instacart and Blue Apron, but Ronen said things have been slower to materialize in the farm-to-table sector. In fact, both Good Eggs and GrubMarket recently suspended operations outside of San Francisco so that they can rethink their model.The challenge, Ronen said, is that farm-to-tablecompanies are reinventing an entire supply chain  its hard, its physical, its not just bits and bytes.Farmigos model works, he argued, because of its food community distribution system (so the company isnt delivering produce to the home of every customer) and because ofthe technology theteam has built to make the process more efficient.Weve basically builtan end-to-end ERP system that tracks everything in the supply chain, Ronen said. We know exactly what [the farmers] inventory is, we know exactly what was preordered and packed, this is the software that the driver uses to manage the pickup site. Building that software has been our labor of love for the last six years.The round was led by Formation 8 (an investment firm founded by Joe Lonsdale, Brian Koo and Jim Kim), with participation from existing investors Benchmark and Sherbrooke Capital. Farmigo has now raised a total of $26 million.
