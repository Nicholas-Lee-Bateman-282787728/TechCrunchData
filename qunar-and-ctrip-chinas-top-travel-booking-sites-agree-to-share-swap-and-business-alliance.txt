Chinas two largesttravel booking giants Qunar and Ctrip are partnering up to end a long period of rivalry and courtship witha share swapand business alliance.The deal follows two majormergers betweencompeting tech companies in China this year (taxi app firms Didi Dache-Didi Kuaidi, and Yelp-like rivals Dianping-Meituan),althoughQunar and Ctrip are entering into a partnership not merging.Bloomberg reported that the two companies have a combined valued of$15.6 billion, so this is a major piece of consolidation nonetheless.WhenQunar raised $500 million in fresh funding back in June it revealed that it had declined an acquisition offer from Ctrip. A statement at the time said itremain[ed] open to engaging in further discussions with Ctrip as well as other strategic players in our sector  saidnegotiations have now borne fruit afterBaidu, the majority investor that made ripples when it backed Qunar back in 2011, agreed to give Ctrip a45 percent voting interest in Qunar in exchange for 25 percent of Ctrip.Beyond mixing their ownership, the companies said they would work together across a broad base of products and services. Baidu said its existing relationship with Qunar  which it sees it use hotel and flight bookings for its Nuomi, maps and mobile search services  would continue, and it seems likely the tech firm will begin cooperating with Ctrip too, now that it is a shareholder.We are excited by this transaction, which we believe will help build a healthy travel ecosystem in China. This milestone transaction will enable us to focus on providing the best travel products and services to our travelers,James Liang, chairman of the board and CEOof Ctrip, said in a statement.China travel is an industry with great potential. As the technology leading player in the industry, Qunar has become Chinas fourth largest e-commerce company with tremendous growth momentum, commented CC Zhuang, CEO and co-founder of Qunar.It isnt clear what changed since the summer offer from Ctrip. Details of the offer were never disclosed, so it could have fallen short of what Qunar expected, but an interesting shift has been the influence within the companys management.Baidu never held a boardroom majority, despite being majority owner of Qunar, butthreenewappointments to the board in September gave it greaterinfluenceand mayhave contributed to the share swap agreement.Unlike some of the previous merger deals, competition wasnt weighing down on either companies and neither was burning capital at crazy rates. This alliance looksto haveplenty of positive synergy, particularly as tourism inside China grows while the country is tipped to become the second larger supplier of global tourists. Certainly, with Ctrip also invested in travel booking firm Tuniu and online travel agency LY.com, it is sitting pretty.
