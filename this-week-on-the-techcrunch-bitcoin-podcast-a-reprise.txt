Hey friends, and welcome back to a partially new episode of the TechCrunch bitcoin podcast, better known as TCBTC. A few weeks back, this little show hosted Jason Rowley on the program, shooting video in the mix.However, due to production overlaps, we didnt get the full audio version up. So, without further ado, here is our show with Mr. Rowley, in proper sonicformat. If you cant find the episode in your favorite podcast app, we apologize. Fire @JohnBiggs a tweet, and we apologizefor the mixup.With Jason we dug into the important bits of the block size question, and, of course, made him prognosticate where the price of bitcoin will land in a bit of time. Hit play, and we will be right back in just a week.Download MP3Subscribe on iTunes.You can subscribe to the show here.
