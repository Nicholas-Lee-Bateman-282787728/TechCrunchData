The space game is hot and only the strongest are going to survive. One Canadian company feels like its in a good spot to succeed, having just been awarded the patent for a space elevator.Back to the hows and whats in a secondthe company, Thoth Technology, took an aggressive shot at Elon Musks SpaceX in the process of announcing the news by way of its CEO, Caroline Roberts:Landing on a barge at sea level is a great demonstration, but landing at 12 miles above sea level will make space flight more like taking a passenger jet.Damn, son.Of course, Roberts is referring to SpaceXs tinkering with landing rockets so they can be used again. Reusable rockets would be a killer breakthrough and a moneymaker for Musks crew. In reality, SpaceX and Thoth could easily work together.The idea of a space elevator isnt new, with reports surfacing that Google was even working on its own headed up by Astro Teller and the X group.If this thing ever gets built, the company proposes that people could be lifted about 12 miles above Earth. Would be a pretty cool joyride, too, no?In addition to taking the elevator for funsies, large equipment could theoretically be pushedup to space at a much lower cost. Having a patent is one thing; actually building it is another. Give me a buzz when I can buy my ticket to space.
