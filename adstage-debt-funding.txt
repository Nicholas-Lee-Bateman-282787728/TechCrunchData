AdStage, a startup that helps businesses run ad campaigns across platforms like Google and Facebook, announced today that it has raised an additional $1.5 million in debt funding.The funding comes from Silicon Valley Bank and follows a $6.25 million equity round last year. Co-founder and CEO Sahil Jain said the vast majority of that money is still in the bank, but he said the debtserves as a very nice insurance policy, especially if he wants to stay competitive as the ad tech industrybecomes increasingly frothy.Specifically, Jain said that if the opportunity arises, the money could help AdStage hire more aggressively or make a small acquisition.If I want to hire five engineers in a week  on top of the 20 people that weve now grown to, that would eat away at [the Series A] money very very quickly, he said.The company says its currently used by more than 4,000 mid-market agencies and advertisers. It also fully removed the beta testing label from its product.In addition to Googles AdWords and Facebook, AdStage supports Bing, LinkedIn and Twitter. In fact, its part of the initial lineup of Twitters just-announced Official Partner Program.That also means providing advertisers with more data, and with that in mind, AdStage is launchedits integration with Google Analyticstoday,allowing advertisers to create custom reports with details about which campaigns are and arent paying off.The company says its already working on more data integrations, including with Google Merchant Center.
