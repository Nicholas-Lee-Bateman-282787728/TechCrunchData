Expensify is taking another step toward making expense reports easier by announcing integrations with a bunchof travel-related services.So instead of forwarding travel receipts to receipts@expensify.com, users can just make their bookings in the partner service of their choice, and the information will automatically be sent to Expensifyfor reporting.This could save you a bit of a headache when youre creating theexpense report for a business trip, andExpensify founder and CEO David Barrett said it also addresses the issue of leakage, where an increasing number of people are doing their travel booking outside the standard corporate systems.The exciting trend is the convergence between expense reporting and business travel and corporate bookings, he added. Historically, corporate booking was something that happened before the business trip, and expense reporting was something that happened after.  Now we kind of overlap in the middle, and were participants throughout the entire process.Expensifys initial travel partners include NuTravel, Egencia, Locomote, NexTravel, Uber, Priceline, Hipmunk and Rocketrip. The company also says there are plans to add GetThere, Amadeus, Atlas Travel and Airbnb.Among theintegrations, the company is highlighting its preferred partnership with NexTravel, which it says will bring all the benefits of corporate travel to our small business customers.
