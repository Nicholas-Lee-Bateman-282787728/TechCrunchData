The FCC followed through on its promise to release a massive document laying out its newrules for net neutrality. The order comes two weeks after the board voted to classify broadband Internet as a utility.The FCC confirmed with TechCrunch last night that the order would be released today.The hundreds of pages in the report lay out a detailed plan for how net neutrality will be enforced. A quick read of the document indicates that it hews to what the FCC originally outlined in a summary that was publicly released before the commission voted on the rules.Heres the text:Todays release also brings us closer to potential legal challenges. As FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said earlier this year, The big dogs [ISPs] have promised that theyre going to litigate. The framework for those challenges will likely be drawn from the dissenting opinions of the Republican members of the board.Put more simply, this is not the end of the net neutrality saga. Instead, we have the battles lines now well drawn, and soon, understood. TechCrunch will be tracking the slew of responses from ISPs, politicians and lobbyists this release is sure to bring.
