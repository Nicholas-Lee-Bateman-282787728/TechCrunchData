After announcing it at E3 2015, Square Enix unveiled the first gameplay trailer for one of its most anticipated games, Final Fantasy VII. And it looks like its more than just a remake with better graphics.As you can see in the trailer below, the new game looks gorgeous. There are a few shots of actual gameplay, and a couple of things are worth noting. First, the remake is going to be a third-person game, switching from the fixed camera angles in the original version.Second, its a brand new combat system. Final Fantasy VII is now an action role-playing game with real-time combats. Im not sure hardcore Final Fantasy VII fans are going to like this move, but its true that turn-based combats are now out of fashion.In this second video, producer Yoshinari Kitase explains some of the changes you can expect in the remake. When it comes to the artistic direction, the team is trying to recreate the same look and feel from the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children movie.While Kitase confirms the new real-time combat system, you can also expect classic RPG elements as players will be able to choose their weapons and more. Its unclear if the new action-focused orientation is going to affect the story.As a reminder, Final Fantasy VII remake is coming on the PlayStation 4. Rumor has it that Square Enix wants to release it in 2017 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original game. Its a temporary exclusive title, meaning that the company could release the game on the Xbox One and PC later. Its going to be a long wait.
