Those combination locks you pick up for a few bucks at the office supply store have never been the epitome of security  but in recent weeks, theyve taken a beating.A few weeks ago, Samy Kamkar  the endlessly clever gent behind the USB necklace thatll hack your computer and the self-title Samy virus that devastated MySpace back in the day  demonstrated a way to crack a Master Lock by hand in just a few minutes.Now hes back with a robot that does all the hard work for you:(If you just want to see the lock get owned in a heartbeat, skip to 0:25 or so in the video above)Effectively an automated version of the manual process he detailed weeks ago, Samys Combo Breaker is a witchs brew of geeky goodness: a stepper motor to spin the dial, a servo motor to tug the lock to see if its open yet, a 3D printed harness to hold everything in place, and an Arduino to handle all the math and tell the motors what they should be doing.So is it time to throw out all of your combination locks? To be honest, probably not  at least, not if you werent looking to ditch them already. As noted right off the bat, these combination locks have never been all that great; theyre enough to keep casual lookie-loos from poking through your locker or desk drawer, but theyre effectively tissue paper to anyone who knows what theyre doing and/or owns a big hammer.If youre using one of these spinners to keep someone looking to borrow a pen from accidentally opening the drawer with all of your Harry Potter fanfic, whatever; if youre using it to protect trade secrets and launch codes, though, you probably want to reconsider your security options.
