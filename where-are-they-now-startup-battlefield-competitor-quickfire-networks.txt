QuickFire Networks launched itsQuickFire TV platform in the Startup Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2014. Perhaps best described as a Pied Piper-esque solution for video, QuickFire TV is a custom hardware and software platform that reduces video file sizes and upload times so individuals and companies can get their videos out faster.And no, please dont ask us what their Weissman Score was.The hardware is pretty impressive, with each server rack containing a custom motherboard built to accommodate 11 quad-core Intel Core i7 processors working in unison. The workload was distributed with a software layer called V-Fabric and the racks were tied together with another layer known as Q-data.While QuickFire didnt make it to the Battlefield Finals, things quickly took off for the company after itsTechCrunch debut. Shortly after participating in the Startup Battlefield, QuickFire caught the eye of Facebook  which bought QuickFire Networks in January 2015 for an undisclosed amount of money. Talk about a quick exit!Now, the technology QuickFire built is being incorporated into Facebooks core platform, which should give Facebook users faster load times and less buffering without a loss in video quality. That technology could be great for Facebook, as competition between Facebook and YouTube heats up over video.Applications for this years Battlefield have formally closed, but theres still hope!
