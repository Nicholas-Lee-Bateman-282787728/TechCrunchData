Its been a good week for game developers. Unreal Engine 4 went free. Unity 5 came out, and a massive chunk of its once premium features went free.And now: Valve has just announced Source 2, the next generation of their Source game engine and sure enough, its free to content developers.Best known as the engine that powers games like Half-Life 2, Team Fortress, Counter-Strike: Go, Left 4 Dead, and Portal 2, the original Source engine* was primarily used for Valves own titles. While a handful of third-party titles (Stanley Parable, Garrys Mod, Titanfall) are Source-powered, theyve never really been Sources bread and butter.Perhaps with this news, thatll change.* built in 2004. Two thousand and friggin four!Now, a bit of a caveat: we dont know much about Source 2 yet. Hell, we dont even know the exact definition of free.So far, all Valve has said on the matter is that Source 2 will be available for free to content developers.Is that 100% free, or will they charge royalties a la Unreal (who charges 5% on every dollar after $3,000)? What, exactly, is a content developer  just indie developers, or are they giving it away to any and all?Its something of a golden age of video game engine licensing. Not too long ago  hell, 5 years ago, licensing a big, brand name engine (including Source) involved gnarly negotiations, NDAs, and a small mountain of cash. Then Unity came along and changed the game.Now you just find the engine with the most agreeable terms and start cracking away.
