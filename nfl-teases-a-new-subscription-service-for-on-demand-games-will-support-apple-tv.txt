The NFL is preparing to launch a new version of its Games Pass service, which will now include the ability to watch games on a wider selection of devices, including the Apple TV. According to information posted on the NFL website, the new Game Pass servicewill also replace Game Rewind, a paid service that previously offered all 256 NFL regular season gameson-demand, after they air on television. Game Rewind will be discontinued on July 31, 2015, the NFL site said, and users will be able to move tothe updated Game Pass service instead.The new Game Pass will offer apps for a number of devices, including mobile platforms as well as select connected TV devices likeXbox One, Xbox 360, Apple TV and more. Notably, this will be the first time that the NFL has provided access to full games on Apple TV  currently, the NFL Now channel on Apple TV features news, historic videos, and game highlights, not full games.The NFL site says apps for these connected TV devices are coming soon, but didnt provide a launch date. Though with the discontinuation of Game Rewind on July 31, the speculation is that this is also when the newGame Pass service rolls out. In addition to connected TV devices, Games Pass will be available through existing mobile apps like NFL Mobilefor iOS, Androidand Windows Phone, as well as on the desktop.According to the website, NFL Game Pass will include all 256 regular-season games on demand, some live out-of-market preseason games, as well as the ability to watch older games from the 2009-2015 seasons, including past Super Bowls.The service will feature tools like a Scores On/Off option to hide spoilers, condensed games that let you look back on entire games in about 30 minutes time, full replays of every game from 2009 on in high-def, exclusive All-22 and EndZone angles to analyze games, DVR controls including fast forward and rewind, and more.Pricing is not yet posted for the new Game Pass service, but is expected soon.The fine print on the site indicates that NFL Game Pass includeslive access to most preseason games, but those that are not available live will be made available on-demand in the NFL Game Pass archives after the original telecast.However, Game Pass does not include live regular season, playoff, and Super Bowl game broadcasts  instead, these will become available after the games air on television. Thats not, then, an ideal solution for thosecord cutters who are looking for alternative ways of watching games in real time through their many devices  but it would work for enthusiasts looking for replays, or those whowant to watch games they would have otherwise missed (e.g. out-of-market fans), or those they couldnt catch live due to other commitments.Sunday morning and afternoon games (9:30am ET, 1pm ET & 4pm ET) are available at the conclusion of all Sunday 4pm ET games, and Sunday night, Monday night, Thursday and Saturday NFL games are available following the conclusion of the applicable game telecast, the site notes.The service will beavailable to users within the United States, Bermuda, Antigua, the Bahamas, any U.S. territories, possessions and commonwealths (including American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands) and Mexico.Meanwhile, the NFLs deal with DIRECTV continues  the NFL Sunday Ticket app will be available in 2015 on more devices, including Xbox 360, Roku and Chromecast for live game streaming, according to DIRECTVswebsite.The app also runs onmobile, desktop, PS 3 & 4, and Xbox One. Apple TV, however, will not be supported the updated FAQ notes at thistime. (But its possible more devices will be supported by launch time, the site teases.)News of the forthcoming Game Pass subscriptionservice has been slowly leaking out ahead of any official announcement by the NFL, thanks not only to the teaser info posted on its own website, but also viaemails sent to current NFL Now Plus subscribers.For example, some users of the NFL Now apprecently received an email thatsaid the premium subscription service NFL Now Plus will not be offered as a standalone subscription product during the 2015 season, and they would no longer be charged from that point forward. However, the email also stated that we will have an announcement soon about our new subscription product for the 2015 season.When reached for comment, an NFL spokesperson said while the information posted on the NFL website has prompted some inquiries, the organization is not prepared to reveal the details until its products are ready to launch.Image credits: NFL email  Cordcuttersnews.com; NFL.com
