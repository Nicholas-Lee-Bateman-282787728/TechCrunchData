This week we cover one noteworthy review of the new MacBook by Marco Arment, as well as iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 details. Apple is supposedly tidying up with both OS updates this year, and also making things more pleasant for older device owners, and thats very good for Tim Cooks favorite customer satisfaction metric.We also discuss the new $2,000 iMac, as well as the update for the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro. And surprisingly, we spend very little time talking about the Apple Watch, for probably the first time since that device became available  or even was first announced.Rumors also suggest iPad could get a dual-screen mode, and were fairly split on how we feel about that. One things certain, though: Apple probably has a ton of new stuff to show off at WWDC this year if theyre spilling the beans on Mac hardware refreshes a few weeks before the actual event.Direct download available here, or find us on iTunes and SoundCloud.
