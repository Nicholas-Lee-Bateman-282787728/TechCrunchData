Numerous startups now sell class passes for childrens activities, including KidPass, which announced $325,000 in seed funding in January,and Pearachute (it raised $1.2 million last month).Now, a Brooklyn-based startup namedSawyer is trying to separate itself from the little kid pack.Its very grown-up ambition: to becomean OpenTable-like platform that makes it easier for museums, theaters, sports centers, and kid-focused service providersto sell childrensclasses directly to families.Its easy to see why. While Sawyer might not follow itsmodel exactly,OpenTable generates plenty of revenue. Itcharges restaurants a fee to get set up; its clients then pay a monthly price for access to its software, plus a fee per patron.In fact, thatvision partly explains the $1.5 million that seven-month-old Sawyerwas able to raisefrom investors,including Notation Capital, Collaborative Fund, VC1,andother strategic angel investors. (Part of that money was raised last fall via a convertible note; Sawyerconverted that funding into equity andclosed on some more thispast Friday.)Of course, every new company has to start somewhere. For now, Sawyer is centered on class passes as its source of revenue, charging a flat monthly fee for access to a mix of venues. Parents and caregivers in Brooklyn (and soon Manhattan) can pay either $99 per month for access to six classes or $39 monthly for access to two classes, says CEO Marissa Evans.The economics are tough, acknowledges Evans, who declines to discuss how much of that monthly subscription feeSawyer keeps on average and how much it sends on to the vendorswith which its working.The companywhich employs just seven people currently and was originally named The Kids Passporthas obviously been experimenting in recent months,including with ways to drum up sales affordably. One effective solution to date, says Evans, is turning tomostly moms whove recently left the workforce and arent interested in crazy lawyer hours any more.Paid on commission, theyve pulled80 vendors onto the platform to date.Sawyerhas also decided against offering any kind of unlimited package of monthly deals, which is something with whichits direct competitors are currently experimenting. (We retain some margin that way, says Evans.)Asked how many clients have signed up for the service so far, Evans declines to say,offering instead that customers have so far booked more than 1,000classes through the platform and that it features4,000 otherlistings (including across dates and times).She addsthat despite the competition, Sawyerfeels less pressure to expand into more cities quickly than to get it right in Brooklyn and Manhattan.Were more focused right now on innovating than trying to get as many families on the platform as quickly as we can,says Evans, who was most recently a general manager at Rent The Runway, where she met her cofounder, Stephanie Choi.Ultimately, she says, the passport will be just one line of business.
