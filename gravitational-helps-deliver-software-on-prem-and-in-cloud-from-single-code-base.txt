Gravitational, a graduate of the Y Combinator 2015 class set out solve a very difficultproblem for companies  how to deliver software in the cloud andon-premises from a single code base.Without a solution like the one from Gravaitional, companies would haveto maintaintwo sets of code, which is simply too costly for most companies to pull off. That meant these companies were sometimesleaving deals on the table from customerswho wanted a delivery model they couldntoffer.Thiswasnt the founders first go with Y Combinator, EvKontsevoy, Gravitationals founder told TechCrunch. His first company, Mailgunwas a member of the YC Winter 2011 class. Itraised$1.2 million, before itwasacquired byRackspace in 2012.Itwas through his experience working at Rackspacefor several years after the acquisition that Kontsevoy began to see some difficultproblems facing companies hosting SaaS programs in the cloud, which would eventually come together and lead him to launch Gravitational.First of all, customers of SaaS companiesliked the simplicity of the delivery model, which didnt require as muchIT overhead to manage, but at the same time, some still neededcontrol over their data. That control issue was exacerbated by companies who were required by law(or preferred to) store their data outside of the United States.As all of this was happening, Kontsevoy also couldnt help but noticethe growing power of Amazon Web Servicesin the cloud market. He could seeit was scaring some on-prem software vendors who wondered how they could compete directly with the public cloud juggernaut.At the same time Kontsevoy began observingthese trends, some key enabling technologies were becoming popular including Docker and Google Kubernetes.As all ofthiscame together, Kontsevoy left Rackspace and formed Gravitational. He created a solution that enabled companies to deploy theirsoftware any way they liked without maintaining two code bases by building a solution usingDocker and Kubernetes as the underlying technologies.Gravitational provides a way to manage the code base from a single management console and deliver it in multiple ways without dramatically increasing costs or development efforts.He obviously understandsthe advantages of participating in Y Combinator having launched and sold one successful company after being a part of it, but he saysthis time around he could seehow the incubator hadevolvedsince he last participated in 2011.For starters,the sheer size of the network hadgrown enormously since 2011 and now included many more enterprise companies. This wasin stark contrast to his earlier experience when many of the companies had focused on consumers and it wasnt as easy for an enterprise company to get help.By 2015, there werea lot of successful alumni who hadbuilt successful [enterprise] companies and couldhelp you with their experience and connections, he said.The company has some funding and some early Beta customers, although he didnt want to reveal numbers at this point. He says by the end of the year he hopes to have a dozen enterprise customers, who have increased theirsales through using his companys software.At the end of the day, Gravitational hopes to help software companies make more money by letting them sell in whichever way makes most sense to their customers  on premises or in the cloud.
