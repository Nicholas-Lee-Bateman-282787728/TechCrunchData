SoundHounds Houndify, which promises to add voice enabled conversational interface to anything, is officially available to developers today.SoundHound is best-known as a music recognition app, but over the summer, it announced broader ambitions with the private beta launch of its Hound app and Houndify platform.The Hound app issimilar in some ways to voice-controlled products like Apples Siri and Amazons Echo, but with a focus on quickly answering complex queries. (For example, when SoundHound founder and CEO Keyvan Mohajer demonstrated the app for me in June, he asked it, When is the sun going to rise two days before Christmas of 2021 in Tokyo, Japan?) The aim of the Houndify platform, meanwhile, is to bring similar capabilities to other apps and devices.Mohajer told me yesterday that the response to the private beta has been strong, with more than 300,000 applications to test out the Hound app, and thousands of developer applications for Houndify. Those werent just small app developers either, he said, but also very big companies, like consumer electronics companies and car manufacturers.So now, Houndify is moving out of beta testing. Mohajer said one of the challenges was usability  maybe not something youd think of asa top priority for developer platforms, but he said Houndify has to be accessible to developers who are not necessarily scientists in this field.SoundHound has also partnered with a number of other companies to make data available through the Houndify platform, including Expedia (hotel and flight data), AccuWeather (local weather), Sportradar (pre-match, live and post-match sports data) and Xignite (stock market).And he suggested that these data partnerships could be useful in that context. Take a smart coffee maker: Yes, youd want to be able to tell it to make coffee with a voice command, But while your espresso machine is making coffee for you, why not ask, Hows the weather?'Houndify is available in both free and paid tiers. SoundHounds consumer voice search app Hound remains in private beta, though Mohajer said, Obviously, thats going to change soon.
