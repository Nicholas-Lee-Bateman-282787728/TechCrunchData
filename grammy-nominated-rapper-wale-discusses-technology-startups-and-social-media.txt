I recently sat down with Grammy-nominated rapper Wale to talk about his views on technology, social media, and the music industry.Like most artists, Wale has a dedicated following on all major social media platforms, and has an interesting perspective on how each one gives him a different relationship with his fans.He is also a pretty avid gamer, and uses video games as a way to unwind after recording or producing in the studio.We also discussed the current state of the music industry, and why the shift to streaming doesnt necessarily have a large financial impact on him.Watch the video aboveto hear more about Wale and his technology interests.
