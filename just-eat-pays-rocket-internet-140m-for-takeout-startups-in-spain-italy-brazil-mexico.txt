The takeout shakeout continues apace. Since going public in 2014, Rocket Internet has been trying tosimplify and reorganize the tangle of e-commerce startupsfunded and grown by the Berlin-based incubator to make the main business more profitable. Today comes thelatest move on that front.Rocket Internetis selling food takeaway operations in Spain, Italy, Brazil and Mexico to Just Eat for 125 million ($140 million)  with the admission that they are all non-core operations that are not market-leading, in the words of Rocket.The operations in Brazil and Mexico accounted for less than 5% of foodpandas revenues in 2015, Rocket noted.Just Eat, based in London, competes with the likes of Delivery Hero and others in online food ordering and delivery services. It went public in 2014 at a $2.4 billion valuation and has been steadily growing, currently valued at $3.7 billion. Rocket Internet is valued at $4 billion. Itslosses have been widening and the stock has been trading at the low end of its range. It gota 10% bump on todays news.Its not completely clear how much Rocket Internet invested in the operations it is selling inSpain (La Nevera Roja), Italy (PizzaBo & hellofood Italy), Brazil (hellofood Brazil) and Mexico (hellofood Mexico). Rocket Internet does not always disclose all of these details, and its often hard for outsiders to gauge money poured intoindividual operations versus the bigger global brands.But e-commerce is agame of thin margins and massive scale, and there are cluesthat Rocket is selling these at a loss.For example, in Italy, hellofoodis understood to have paid 55 million  nearly half the value of the whole deal today  for PizzaBo alone.And in Spain, Rocket Internet acquired La Nevera Roja only in February 2015, for a price understood to be 80 million, according to Jaime Novoa, who also picked up on the Spanish portion of this sale/acquisition weeks before Rocket Internet and Jus actually confirmed it.Just Eat notes that thevalue of the gross assets of the businesses acquired as at 31 December 2014 was 6.4 million ($7.1 million). The aggregate losses before tax were 16.3 million ($18.2 million).Just Eat seems to think that it will be able to build a profit where Rocket Internet could not. The businesses grew orders by83% in 2015, Just Eat says, and it projects the new businesses will add 5 million ($7.3 million) to Just Eats 2017 EBITDA, and10 million in 2018.To be sure,Rocket Internet still has an appetite for thefood ordering and delivery business: the company has pooled other assets from the portfolio, as well as investment, into a partnership with onetime rival DeliveryHero.The online takeaway market remains a core focus of Rocket Internets business strategy with the significant ownership in the market leaders Delivery Hero and foodpanda, Oliver Samwer, CEO of Rocket Internet, said in a statement. Todays transactions are clearly aimed at reducing the complexity of Rocket Internets network of companies.It claims that its remainingtakeout business, foodpanda, is the market leader in growth markets with a presence in 24 countries.Whats becoming more clear, however, is that the larger food delivery businesses, after years of wild-sized investments, consolidation and ruthless price-busting competition for market share, are now in a more sober period of refocus thats resulting in some reshuffling among the bigger players to build up in specific regions.The divestment in Latin America allows us to focus on our key markets across Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe where foodpanda has a market leading position and to which we can now dedicate more resources and capital to grow our business and improve the efficiency of our operations. We are on a very good path to reach our global growth target, saidRalf Wenzel, Co-founder and CEO of foodpanda, a sentiment echoed by Just Eat.The acquisitions from Rocket Internet and foodpanda represent a positive step forward for the global online takeaway industry enabling all parties to focus their resources on building bigger and better long term businesses in their key geographies, saidDavid Buttress, CEO, Just Eat, in a statement.Rocket saidthat its limited property value,including cash, remains at the latest disclosed figure of 7.2billion as of 30 November 2015.Rocket said thetransactions in Italy, Brazil and Mexico will be completed today. Thetransaction in Spain will be completed by the end of Q2 2016, as it is still subject to regulatory approval from the Spanish competition authority, the Comisin Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia, it added.
