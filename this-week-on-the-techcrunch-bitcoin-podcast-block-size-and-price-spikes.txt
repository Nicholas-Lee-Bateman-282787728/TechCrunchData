TCBTC, TechCrunchs premier bitcoin podcast, is back.After a brief hiatus, John Biggs and myself are hereto make yet another hash out of bitcoin. Biggs is in Poland, making this among our first multi-continent shows. (Well be back in the TechCrunch studio live, on video, in about a month. But for now, were Skypin.)We hit on the block size debate, Greece and bitcoins current dance, and, of course, the price of the damn stuff. Make some lunch, and hang out with us. Well see you guys next week.Download MP3Subscribe on iTunes.You can subscribe to the show here.
