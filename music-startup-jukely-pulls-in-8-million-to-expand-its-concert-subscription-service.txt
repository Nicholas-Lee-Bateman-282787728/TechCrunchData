Monthly concert subscription service Jukely has raised $8 million in a seed extension round from existing investors to expand into at least 20 more cities in the next year.The round was led by previous investorsNorthzone and former Warner Music executive Alex Zubillagas14W, with additional participation from Larry Marcus, Hany Nada, Lyor Cohen, Maiden Lane and GroupMe founders Steve Martocci and Jared Hecht.This brings the total investment up to a healthy $11.3 million in seed money.Jukely launched out of the Techstars NYC 2013 accelerator programasa sort of matchmaker for music lovers. Those into new and unique bands could go on the site and find those with similar tastes to go to concerts with. The startup began offering music lovers Jukley Unlimited earlier last year, which is an opportunity to go to an unlimited amount of concertswith lesser-known bandsfor $25 per month.TheUnlimitedidea caught on in New York City and Jukely quickly expanded the service to 10 U.S. cities  including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, Chicago, Miami, Toronto, Seattle, Philadelphia and Denver.The service has proved to generate additional revenue and is clearly expanding the market for the live music industry by getting music lovers to attend shows they normally wouldnt go to see, Jukely co-founder Bora Celik said.According to Jukely, subscribers go to 2-3 shows per month on average, with 65 percentof them goingto see artists theyd never heard of before. While there are plenty of recognizable bands listed on the Jukely app, the Unlimited portion offers a much more select set ofbands youve probably never heard of (or maybe you are just socool you have).The new funding will allow Jukelyto hire people in both marketing and engineeringand double the current team of 15in order to expandthe unlimited service to more than 20 cities in both the U.S. and Europe.While Celik did not want to mention where the subscription servicemight be available next, he did talk aboutan upcomingLondon trip in the same breath asthe number of cities he hopes to expand to, so London could be next.
