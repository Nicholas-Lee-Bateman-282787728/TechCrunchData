Its funny how things can change quickly. Just two months ago,Rahul Yadav, the young co-founder of CEO of SoftBank-backed Housing.com, was heralded as a role model forIndias startup space after giving away his entire shareholding (worth at least $23.5 million) to the companys staff.Today, however, the 26-year-olds maverick style caught up with him after he was released from his role at the company. The confirmationfollows a week of uncertainty after Economic Times reported Yadavs imminent departure, not to mention months of controversy.Housing.com looked like a good example of a fast-growing India tech startup when it raised a $90 million round led by Japanese telecom giant SoftBank last year. But issues began to emergethis year when first SoftBank VP Nikesh Arora resigned from the Housing.com board after Yadav attacked VC firm Sequoia for its apparent efforts to poach his staff. Things looked rockier still when Yadav tendered his resignation in May, berating the companys investors, only to stay on in his role after all, while he attacked other startup CEOs in a Reddit AMA.When TechCrunch spoke to Yadav in May, following his decision to give away his stakeholding, he told us that he felt better than ever.Im still committed [to Housing.com], he said. My energy and enthusiasm and freshness has increased, and Im really happy.Yadav may have felt relieved by unloading his stake in the business, but investors clearly didnt share that optimism. In a statement released to press today, following a board meeting, they explained that the decision to remove him was unanimously agreedwith reference to his behavior towards investors, ecosystem and the media.The Board believed that his behavior is not befitting of a CEO and is detrimental to the company, known for its innovative approach to product development, market expansion and brand building, the statement continued, explaining that Yadavwill have no role in the company going forward.Beyond its core service connecting house buyers and renters with properties,Housing.com has ambitious plans to develop a new service focused on helping house-builders develop affordable and decent quality homes in India. However it seems thatthere was serious concern that its CEO was incapable of steadying the ship and delivering the goods.The companys next move is to appoint Yadavssuccessor. Dont expect anyone too flamboyant to step into the role.
