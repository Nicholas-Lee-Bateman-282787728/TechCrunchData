Vesselsvideo subscription service, headed by former Hulu CEO Jason Kilar and CTO Richard Tom, has today expanded to Android. The app is initially offeredas an open beta available for download from the Google Play store. The service, which offers early access to videos from a number of creators before they hit YouTube or Vimeo, will now workon any Android device that runs version 4.1 (Jelly Bean) or higher, the company says.Vesselsservice first launched in January of this year, offeringa variety of high-quality, short-form videos spanning gaming, music, sports, beauty, lifestyle, comedy, fashion, science, tech, design and more in one curated experience. The bigger idea here  spawned from the co-founders prior experience with Hulu  is to introduce the same kind of windowing that existed previouslywithtraditional media,alongside dualrevenue streams involving both subscription fees and ads, also similar toHulu.The startup has already raised over $132 million in venture funding from Benchmark, Greylock, Bezos Expeditions and IVP, according to CrunchBase.Content creators are encouraged to release their videos first on Vessel (typically 72 hours ahead of YouTube or elsewhere) and, in return, theyre promised the chance to makemore money than on free, ad-supported sites alone.To date, Vessel has signed up a number of creators with this pitch, including The Ellen DeGeneres Show,Machinima, Tastemade, DanceOn, Rhett & Link, Shane Dawson, Marcus Butler, Connor Franta, Caspar Lee, Ingrid Nilsen, Tanya Burr, Anna Akana, Brittani Louise Taylor, Arden Rose, Explosm Entertainment, Nerdist Industries, Jimmy Tatro, Unbox Therapy, Jack Vale, and Wassabi Productions.Its also working with biggercompanies likeA+E Networks,Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and others.The company originally estimated that creators would earn $50 per thousand views, but recently said that it was exceeding those numbers.Because its content comes largely from creators rather than big studios, its subscription fee is a modest $2.99 per month. But Vesselstill has the challenge of convincing a younger, and therefore potentially more frugal, demographic to pay for videos that will soon be free on YouTube. Thecompany isnt disclosing how many users it has today, but notes thatmorethan 80 percent of its active subscribers are watching theearly access videos on a weekly basis.Today, Vessel offers videos from over 175creatorswho have a combined audience of over 200 million YouTube viewers. The app alsoallows users the option of following their favorite shows, channels and categories in order to have a more personalized experience.The new Vessel app for Android is here.
