The eccentric millionaire John McAfee will be joining us on Disrupt TV Live at TechCrunch Disrupt SF next week to discuss his presidential ambitions and new political party.The developer of the first commercial anti-virus program announced his White House bid earlier this month. Never one to conform, McAfee will run for his newly created Cyber Party, which promotes privacy and aims to curtail government surveillance.In 2010 Intel bought McAfees company. The company renamed it to Intel Security last year to distance it from its founders antics.McAfee found the spotlight again in 2012 when he was fled Belize after he was named a person of interest in the shooting death of his neighbor. Hes since zig-zagged the U.S., making headlines for his concerns about government surveillance.I am called not serious, yet I know of no-one who has lived a more serious life, he wrote on his campaign site. I hid in the jungles of Central America for weeks while being chased by an army representing a government that I had refused to be extorted by. Please. tell me what is not serious about this.Since announcing his presidential bid, McAfee has committed to answering questions about what he has called his checkered personal history in interviews.McAfee will appear on Disrupt TV Live Monday afternoon for a fireside chat. The General admission tickets are still available. Were excited to have him.
