As part of Intels $300 million commitment to diversity, the company has announced a multi-year partnership and $1.3 million investment in CODE2040, a non-profit organization that helps get black and Latino/a students of color involved in tech.This comes a little over a month after CODE2040 raised $1.2 million from the Knight Foundation.With a specific focus on broadening the participation of diverse talent in the tech industry, CODE2040s mission aligns with Intels own priorities and together we can shift from acknowledging the problem to implementing comprehensive solutions that accelerate access to educational, professional and entrepreneurial opportunities in technology, Intel Corporation Executive Director of Strategy and External Alliances Barbara McAllister wrote on Medium.The money will go towards supporting CODE2040s Fellows program, which places students in career-building workshops and internships at top tech companiesand TechnicalApplication Prep programs,a newer CODE2040 initiative aimed to prepare students to get internships and thrive at top tech companies.This year and next, Intel will host 60 student interns from the CODE2040 Fellows program in Santa Clara. Intel will also host students from CODE2040s TAP program for part of a five-day Tech Trek.We are very proud of the multi-year partnership with Intel to create access, awareness, and opportunities for Black and Latino/a engineering talent, CODE2040 CEO Laura Weidman Powers said in a statement. This transformative partnership allows CODE2040 to expand our work to increase the impact of diversity in the innovation economy.
