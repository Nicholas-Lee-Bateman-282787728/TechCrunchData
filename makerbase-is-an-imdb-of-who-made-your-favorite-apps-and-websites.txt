A new servicecalled Makerbase wants to make it easier for anyone to discover who built some of the most popular websites and apps people use every day. The idea, which is described as an IMDb for people who make software, is the latest project from ThinkUps founders  Lifehacker founding editor Gina Trapani and early blogger and entrepreneur Anil Dash.Essentially, Makerbase is an editable directory, not entirely dissimilar from the startup directory CrunchBase, but one thats focused not necessarily on who founded a company, invested in it, or who held executive roles there, butwho are the people thatare actually building the technology behind some of our favorite online and mobile tools.At a surface level, its fun to see who makes the apps and sites we use every day, and fun for hackers and creators to be able to list all their work, explains Dash. But at a bigger level, this is a powerful tool for opening up opportunity in the industry, because it shows the network and connections between people, and maybe even offers those who arent in the industry a glimpse into whos making things and a chance to gain access, he says.To use the service, visitors to the site can sign in with Twitter to set up an account, and can then keep tabs on when pages change by optionally adding anemail.On the Makerbase homepage, theres a search box that lets you search across the database by either maker or the project, as well as a list of featured makers such asTracy Chou of Pinterest, Buster Benson of Locavore, Marques Brownlee of MKBHD, and Ayah Bdeir of littleBits, for example, as well as a list of featured projects.The site also showsthe top contributors for the day and displays a feed of recent activity, including new entries and changes. Each project entry also includes its own activity feed, so you can see whos been added over timealong with other updates.To create an entry, you first enter it in the search box. If it doesnt already come up, you can clickCreate this Maker or Create this Project to add it. Makerbase then automatically pulls in information from Twitter or the App Store to fill out the details. Afterward, you can continue to flesh out the entry by adding the names of makers who worked on it along with description of what they did, if you choose. The service also suggests those a maker tends to collaborate with, which is helpful.Dash says the site had been in testing with a few hundred users before todays launch, where its debuting to the public at the first-ever White HouseDemo Day event.This event allows entrepreneurs from around the country to showcasetheir projects,as opposed to pitching investors aswith typical demo days. In Makerbases case, its hoping to serve asa resource for those looking to break into the tech industry, and want to find outwho it is they should know.We launched Makerbase as part of the event because we think that making the networks of creators visible really helps up-and-coming entrepreneurs  especially those from underrepresented communities- get access to opportunity, explains Trapani. We often talk to younger people entering tech, and even more common than questions about learning to code is that they simply dont know who to have a cup of coffee with, or how to learn who made an app that they would love to help build.Though meant more as a side project, Makerbase does have a sponsorship model built in to help it monetize  the service lets you identify tools that you use to make a project. At launch, you can pick from Slack, MailChimp and Hover, but the company plans to add more sponsors starting next year. In the long run, this could become just as valuable a resource, if this feature was built out further as it would let you see not only who made something, but what they used to do so.While there is some overlap with services like CrunchBase, LinkedIn, or even Github, Makerbase is a much simpler type of directory, at least for the time being. Users profile pages are fairly basic  they dont always include dates worked at a company or job titles, though its possible to add a date range as well asa description of the project which could include a title, perhaps. In other words, it wont necessarily be a resourcefor anything much more than who build what and who they like to work with.But that alone has value, as it allows project contributors to highlight their roles in some of the best developments in websites, apps and services. Its also useful for helping youdiscover who worked on software at major tech companies where the names of the engineers, leads and designers are often overshadowed by the name of the company itself.For example, a page for Google Reader, the now retired (but still beloved)RSS reader from Google, includes a long list of names of those who were tasked with the project in some form or another.
