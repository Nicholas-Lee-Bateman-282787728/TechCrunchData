When we first checked in on hardware startup Butterfleye, they set out to raise $100,000 on Indiegogo to build its smart home monitoring system. Well, it blew through that goal and has raised an unbelievably impressive $604,451.The camera itself promises to cut out false positives when alerting you of movements in your home. An example? A light turning on and off triggers motion for some systems. Its smart technology that Im sure Alphabets Nest and Dropcam (and other companies), is already paying attention to. The cameras will retail for around $260.I chatted with Butterfleyes CEO Ben Nader about their technology, stretch goals, manufacturing philosophy and of coursethe all-important projected ship date.Theres still 50 or so hours left to get in on the campaign if you want to get one early.
