The Gillmor Gang Kevin Marks, Keith Teare, Frank Radice, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Saturday, May 14, 2016. The Gang poles down the Big Muddy of what used to be 3 channels and rabbit ears. Now its the phoneopoly vs. the live sports legacy advertising buy. In the middle a new power center, an adhoc bundle of streaming services and apps direct. Look out Cleveland, the storm is comin through.@stevegillmor, @kevinmarks, @fradice, @kteareProduced and directed by Tina Chase Gillmor @tinagillmorLiner NotesLive chat streamThe Gillmor Gang on Facebook
