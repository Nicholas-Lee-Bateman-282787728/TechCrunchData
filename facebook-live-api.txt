Facebook Live could take live video to a new level of popularity. Now third-party developers willget a chance to participate.Today at FacebooksF8 developer conference, the companysaid its releasing an API for developers who want to plug into Facebook Live, and it also announced the first partners  including Livestream (maker of the Mevo camera), BuzzFeed, Vidpresso and drone-maker DJI.The goal, said Facebooks Chris Cox (pictured above) is to allow hundreds of people to experience the exact same moment at the exact same time. Cox also said the API will allow both hardware- and software-makers to integrate with Facebook Live.I got some more details from Livestream about its work with Facebook. You may remember Mevo under its original name, Movi. Its a camera that offers the illusion of shooting video from multiple cameras, allowing you to edit on-the-fly using your iPhone and even create a video thats automatically edited to focus on interesting footage.Mevo isnt limited to live broadcasting, but if you want to share live video, Facebook Live seems like a pretty obvious place to do it  except that Livestream has its own website for that. CEO Jesse Hertzberg told me Livestreams aim is to give businesses all the tools they need to share video, even if its not on the Livestream site.In particular, he said that one of the big pieces of early customer feedback was, Man, Id love to stream to Facebook, to Twitch, to anywhere I want. So Livestream is working to make that possible.We obviously want to sell as many cameras as possible, Hertzberg said. This is a great way to open up the market.The Mevo camera is currently available for pre-order at a price of $299, with plans for general availability in July.
