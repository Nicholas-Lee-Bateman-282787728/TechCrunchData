Amazon Prime has become Amazons way of getting cool stuff into peoples hands quicker, to the tune of an annual $99 subscription. You can get packages faster, access video content and more. Its definitely worth it.The latest Prime promotion allows members to get their hands on the Amazon Dash dongles, which let you order more of whatever item you want. For yet another extra fee. They were free for a bit with an invitation, but now they will run you $4.99.If you havent heard about Dash, heres the quick skinny: Need more toilet paper? Put the Cottonelle Dash in the john and give it a tap. I mean, youd have to wait a while to get the shipment, and youd have to get up to get it from out front of your house, but you get the idea:You can literally buy one Dash at $4.99 for each of these brandsso that you can buy MORE of all of them:Thank you Amazon for letting me pay you to send me something that helps me spend more on things more often. Pure evil genius. Its cool tech, theres no doubt about it.April Fools Joke? Nyet!Remember those 1-click order Amazon Dash Buttons that seemed like a joke? Now shipping, $5 http://t.co/ESptaWKJYw pic.twitter.com/PelLYV5uxT Rich DeMuro (@richdemuro) July 29, 2015Real fools joke!Personally, I think you should get these things for freeor at least a couple of them, whether you have a Prime account or not. After all, were spending more than enough money on Amazon if we even entertain paying $4.99 a pop for these little buggers.
