DataXu, a Boston-based startup that provides analytics and other tools for programmatic ads, has picked up another round of funding. Sky, the UK-based pay-TV provider part-owned by 21st Century Fox,has made a $10 million investment in the company.Considering DataXu (pronounced data zoo) is reportedly valued at $1 billion-plus, its not a massive stake but it is a strategic one: Sky plans touse DataXus demand-side buying ad tech in its current services as well as work together on future products. DataXu claims that its platform processes some 100 billion digital advertising opportunities daily globally, and Skys advertising division Sky Media plans to tap into that.Additionally, Sky Media will also work closely with DataXu to explore a number of new opportunities, including extending the reach of Sky Medias revolutionary advertising product, Sky AdVance; leveraging DataXus market-leading experience in helping advertisers buy addressable TV ads programmatically; and harnessing the power of data and analytics to drive superior marketing results, the companys said in a statement.DataXus valuation is not being disclosed in this round, but CB Insights, which compiles financedata on startups and other tech companies, tells us that it has marked DataXu as part of theunicorn club with a valuation over $1 billion  since 2015. DataXu tells TechCrunch that its 2014 revenues were $167.5 million, up from $100 million the year before. (These are the latest figures the company discloses, a spokesperson tells me.)In years past, the startup was alsorumored to be exploring an IPO; however, there was no comment on this today from a spokesperson. We will update this story when and if we find out more.Unsurprisingly, theaggregation model is more widely used today, as it gives advertisers a better and more efficient way of buying and managing media campaigns across a wider range of properties. Companies that compete with it include AppNexus, Media Math and Open X among others.This investment will help us develop a deeper understanding of programmatic advertising, and play our part in shaping the market as it progresses, said Jamie West, Deputy MD at Sky Media in a statement. Combining Skys knowledge, experience and innovation in advertising with DataXus programmatic marketing expertise will provide exciting opportunities for both businesses, and most importantly, for Skys advertising partners.DataXuhas now raised nearly $76 million in funding, including a $27 million round in 2013.
