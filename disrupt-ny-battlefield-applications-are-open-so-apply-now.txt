Disrupt New York will be here in no time, and you know what that means. You should probably get started on Disrupt NY Battlefield applications.For those of you who dont yet know, the Startup Battlefield is a world-renowned startup competition. Its like the Gymnastics portion of the Summer Olympics for the early stage investment world. Its like March Madness for tech geeks. Its wonderful, and its all going down in the best city in the world.As a proud member of the TechCrunch NY team, Im expecting nothing but the best from this years main stage event. The winner will take home $50,000 in cash, the Disrupt Cup, and the attention of the tech world.Companies selected will have six minutes to pitch to some of the most respected VCs in the world. The list of previous Battlefield judges include Fred Wilson of USV, David Tisch from Box Ventures and Spring, Roelof Botha from Sequoia, and Yahoos Marissa Mayer.Alongside the Battlefield, Disrupt NY will feature panels and interviews with some of the biggest names in tech. Last year we spoke to HBOs Silicon Valley creator Mike Judge, #GirlBoss Sophia Amoruso, and Whispers Michael Heywire. This years show will go down May 4 to May 6 at the Manhattan Center in New York.Long story short? Its all worth it.The Battlefield is open to startups in any vertical, whether you are focused on software, hardware, the consumer market or the enterprise market, as long as you bring your A-game. We do, however, have a strong preference towards companies that are launching a product for the first time on our stage. Oh, and anyone in the world can apply.
