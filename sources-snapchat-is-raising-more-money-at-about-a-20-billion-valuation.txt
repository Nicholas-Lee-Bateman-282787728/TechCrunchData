Snapchat may have firstmade its name in the crowded world of mobile apps with anephemeral messaging service, but the startup and its wildly popularapp arenotdisappearing anywhere soon. TechCrunch has learned from multiple sources thatSnapchat is raising yet more financing at arounda $20 billion valuation. Sources with knowledge of the deal say the social media giant is in the process of around of about$200 million.This new financing, we understand, is a follow-on to the $175 million Series F round led by Fidelity.Snapchat was said to be valued at $16 billion in thatround, flat on theyear before. However, filings from earlier this month and embedded below, uncovered for us by marketanalysts VC Experts, show that the Series F was expanded.Based on a share price of$30.72 per share  which VC Experts tells uswas the value disclosed inan earlier Fidelity Fund filing related to itsSnapchat investment  and assuming all of the authorized shares are issued,the more recent valuation could be as high as $22.7 billion. Authorized shares do not always all convertto issued shares, butthis gives us a range thatfits in with whatweve heard aboutthe $20 billion valuation.Expanding theSeries F with a Series FP, as its described in the document below, would also fit in with a description weve heard more than once about Snapchats fundraising: The startup is always raising on a rolling basis, partly because investors are so interested.They get offers all the time, one investor close to the company said.And once you start to grow on this path, many peoplecome to give you money.You dont know how to value the company, so the best way to do that is to do some kind of rolling funding. When you have a hot companyand many people areapproaching you,you do a market of discovery.That may bedifferent from other startups, but in a way it reflects Snapchatsown fast growth and itstaste for trying out new things like QR codes to connect to accounts and content, their crazy face-changing filters and more.Besides Fidelity, other existinginvestors in the company include Alibaba, which led its Series E; Benchmark (Series A lead);Coatue Management (Series C lead); General Catalyst; IVP (Series B lead); Saudi investment group Kingdom Holding Company; KPCB (series D lead); Lightspeed (Snapchats earliest and most constant investor);SV Angel; WeChat owner Tencent and Yahoo. We hear that many existing investors are looking to participate in this new round, including Spark Capital.Snapchat declined to comment on the newer fundraising. Sources close to the company confirmed that a previous round had already closed earlier this year at a valuation different from the $20 billion weve been hearing.Snapchat, based out of Los Angeles, has hadrapid growth since launching five years ago. The startup says it has over 100 million daily active usersof itsphoto and messaging service.While there is no question that Snapchat is gaining traction, particularly with the millennial demographic, the hefty valuation can be risky. The greater the valuation, the less likely companies could afford to acquire Snapchat. It also puts pressure on an eventual IPO, with the expectation that the companys market cap will be higher.Tumultuous tech stocks and other unknown factors resulted in Fidelity writing down its value of Snapchat last fall. But that didnt prevent the investor from buying more shares this spring.Those who are bullish on the company believethe high valuationwill bear out. The company, said a source, is thinking two or three generations out in terms of its growth and what it will tackle next, whether that ismore international markets, a wider range of demographics, new kinds of advertising or other paid services or new products altogether.One source claimed that hardware is in the companys sights, which is not the first time this has come up.It is also possible that it will continue to make acquisitions to fuel growth.Snapchat acquired Bitstrips for $100 million in recent months.The new round would bringSnapchats total funding to over $1.5 billion.
