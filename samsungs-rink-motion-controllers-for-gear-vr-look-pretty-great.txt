If you remember, Oculus just shared that their own motion controllers, the Touch, will be delayed until the second half of 2016. HTC and Playstation also have their own flavor of controllers.Have a look at Samsungs rink in action below:The video description translates to:Samsung C lab development challenges rink is Samsung VR and interlocking gears, hand-operated controllers. Hand operation via a sensor worn on the hand may move the virtual reality contents , you can click or drag. CES 2016 showcase scene of demonstrations scheduled in the arena rink, Meet video!Im looking forward to being able to pore through menus using the controller, which looks a bit like interacting with screens in the movie Minority Report. Photos of the rink, which are basically all that we have other than the video, show what it might be like to type on a virtual keyboard. Basically, itll do way more than a Wii controller will, even though Samsung looks like be positioning it as something similar (see the Tennis pose.)So Samsung has gotten Oculus content to consumers faster with their Gear VR partnership, and now is preparing to get people used to using their hands in VRperhaps before Oculus can, again. No other information, including price or ship date has been shared, but lets keep our fingers crossed its sometime before the summer. Well know more next week.
