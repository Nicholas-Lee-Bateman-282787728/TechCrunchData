Uber China, Ubers independent business in China, has announced this morning that it has taken a strategic investment from Chinese automaker GAC Group.The investment from GAC (Guangzhou Automobile Group) is undisclosed, but Uber China said that the tie-in will also include partnerships around auto sales, services,financing, and marketing, with a particular emphasis on promoting new energy vehicles.GAC produces both consumer vehicles  under itsTrumpchi, Gonow andChangfeng Motor brands  in addition to buses and commercial trucks. The group claims to be on track to sell 2.4 million vehicles in 2015. While it has partnerships with Fiat, Honda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi and Toyota, that salesvolume means GACisnt one of Chinas biggest carmakers. But  with atargetof200,000 electric vehicle sales by 2020 theres plenty of potential around affordable, green vehicles: an area where Uber is increasingly keen to play.Uber is present in 21 cities in China. The country is close to overtaking the U.S. as its biggest market, but already Uber is planning a massive expansion that could take it to more than 100 Chinese locations. To make that happen, Uber China raised $1.2 billion in funding, which included investment from Uber Global and its existing partner Baidu, at an apparent $7 billion valuation.While Uber is used to being the bigger fishin most markets, things are a little different in China. Didi Kuaidi, a company formed earlier this year when Chinas two top ride-sharing companies merged, dominates the local scenewith more than threemillion rides completed per day. (Uber has around one million daily rides in China.) Didi Kuaidi is backed by a glut of top companies, including Alibaba, Tencent and SoftBank, and it has raised more than $4 billion in investment. That included a recent $3 billion injection of capitalat a $16.5 billion value, which makes Uber Chinas efforts look like smallchange in comparison.
