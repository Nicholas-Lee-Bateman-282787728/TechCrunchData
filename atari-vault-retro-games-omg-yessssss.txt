Longing for the days of the sticky floored arcades of your youth and long nights spent with the Atari 2600, but cant be bothered to dig through your mums basement to find all the bits and bobs to throw yourself into a retro-gaming binge? Arent you in some industrial-strength luck. Available starting today onSteam,Atari Vault gives you 100 retro games to while away a rainy weekend.Whats not to loveThe game vault includes severalAsteroids, Breakout, Championship Soccer, Dodge-Em, Double Dunk, Millipede (both the 2600 and the arcade versions), Outlaw, the original Pong arcade version, Sub Commander, Super Breakout, and, well, another 90or so more games.The selection is heavily skewed toward Atari 2600 games, but theres a fist-full of arcade versions as well, to keep things interesting. If you have a Steam Controller squirreled away somewhere, you can getthe full arcade trackball experience on games like Centipede, too.Whenever I hear Atari my heart rate shoots up, my right hand cramps up into a joystick-shaped claw and my eyes start to water in anticipation of the all-nighters of days gone by, so spending $16.99 on 100 of the old classics seems like a bargain. Youve got to be quick, however: the price will be bouncing back up to $19.99 when the introduction offer expires.Still need a bit of help to convince yourself? At the introductory price of $17, even if you only spend 20minutes with each game, thats still just $0.50 per hour of entertainment. Youve spent money on dumber things, and you know it.
