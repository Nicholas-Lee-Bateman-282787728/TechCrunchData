Shopline, a startupthat wants to bring more sophisticationto the online sellers whohave sprouted upalongside the rise of social media inAsia, has landed $1.2 million to developits service and expand across Southeast Asia.The Hong Kong-based startup took part in 500 Startups U.S.-based accelerator program (batch 10) last year. 500 Startups is indeed an investor in this seed round, alongside Ardent Capital  the parent company of Southeast Asia-based commerce platformaCommerce  Hong Kongs SXE Ventures, East Ventures and COENT Venture Partners in Singapore.Shopline provides an out-of-the-box package that givesonline retailers of all sizes their own website, payments system and logistics network for their business. Beyond the basics  includingan easydashboard tomanage thestore front and track data  Shopline offers marketing and promotion services to helpless tech savvy retailers grow their reach and visibility, while it says websites are responsively designed to support visitors frommobile devices.The one-year-old startupinitially adopteda freemium model, but it haschanged that. Now retailers pay $40 per month, and  importantly  they do not incur any transaction fees at all.Shopline CEO and co-founderRaymond Yip told TechCrunch in an interview that the company has helped create over 15,000 shops to date. Yip said its top sellers are grossing $25,000-$35,000 in revenue per month, but there are plenty of smaller retailers using the service for their side project business.The companyis immediately focused on the Chinese-speaking markets of Hong Kong and Taiwan, Yip said, but it will look to expand its presence into Southeast Asia this year.The rise of social media shops  wherein merchants sell items viaFacebook, Instagram and other sites, often using messaging apps to communicate and ATM/bank transfers to pay  has not gone unnoticed. U.S.-based Shopify made a big push into Asia, and there are countlessdomestic rivalsand marketplace sites like Rocket Internets Zalora and Lazada open to merchants, but Yip believes Shoplines focus onAsia is key.There are global players, but a lot of them dont speak the language of the local market  their language of business is different. We want to give the merchants here what they need. he said.For instance, Yip pointed outthat Shopline supports deliveries to 7/11 stores in Taiwan  thats something that is near-standard for those in the country who order goods from online stores.Yip admitted that Southeast Asia is an enticing market for Shopline, butit willneed to takea market-by-market approach to expansions given the importance of local factors in each country. Thats certainly where a partner like Ardent Capital (aCommerce) could be hugely important since its network spans the key markets in Southeast Asia.Right now, Shopline uses a combination of word-of-mouth, seminars and direct contact with top merchants to recruit new retailers to its platform.We tell merchants that they can continue to work and sell on social media, were just giving them new options, he explained.Given the success of artisanal online commerce such as Etsy in the U.S., aunified marketplace for all Shopline merchants might make sense as destination for potential customers.Yip said that the company has been working on such an ideathat it will launch to the public in the future.
