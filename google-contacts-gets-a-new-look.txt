Google Contactsis getting an update. Contacts sits at the core of services like Gmail, Google+, Hangouts and others, but it never felt like Google was putting a lot of resources into this service. Now, its not only getting a new look, but also a couple of new features that will make using it a bit easier.The new look takes its cues from Googles other services that have adopted its Material Design language. Inbox users, especially, should feel right at home here, though for Gmail users, the switch mayfeel a bit jarring.Here is what the new Contacts looks like:Besides the new design, Google is adding three new features to Contacts, too.If you are anything like me, you probably have multiple profiles for a couple of your contacts (one for a friendsemail address and one for his or herphone number, for example). Now, with the updated find duplicates tools, itll get a bit easier to merge all of those. I just tried it with the 32 duplicates Google found for me and its as easy as clicking the merge button.Also new in this update is the ability to see all your recent emails and meetings with a person right in their  also redesigned  contact card, and Google will try to keep your Contacts automatically updated based on their Google profile information.The preview is rolling out now, but you can bypass that process by heading tocontacts.google.com/previewdirectly (unless you are a Google Apps customers, then youll still have to wait a bit before this updates becomes available to you).
