So remember that time when HBO CEO Richard Plepler said that he didnt care if users shared their HBO accountpasswords? Apparently, so did Emmy host Andy Samberg. Joking around tonight at the 67th Annual Emmy Awards, the comedian gave out what he said was hislogin and password to theHBO NOW streaming service.But it wasnt just a joke as it turned out  it was a functioning HBO NOW account.Luckily for you, the CEO of HBO recently said he doesnt think password sharing for their streaming services is a problem, Samberg said. So heres my HBO Now login!The login details, in case youre interested:Khaleesifan3@emmyhost.com is the user name, and password1 isthe password.Gotta have a number in there, throw em off the scent, said Samberg.Youre welcome, he added.Of course, we tried the account immediately, assuming that it was a joke. But to our surprise, the login actually worked. We were in!Well, for a minute, at least. Upon subsequent attempts, the account no longer works.As it turned out, much of America had the same idea to try the login as well. And now the account gives the error message that there are too many devices in use.It was good while it lasted!The account information @AndySamberg gave for @HBO Now is actually very real, but it says: pic.twitter.com/YSf6eatWjK Peter Sciretta (@slashfilm) September 21, 2015So Andys HBO Now works pic.twitter.com/70uB7cPMk0 Christina Warren (@film_girl) September 21, 2015Best HBO marketing idea in a while.

2015Update: According to Variety, HBO heard that Samberg would joke about HBOs password sharing, but only learned of the details live, along with TV viewers. The HBO team improvised to set up an account with the credentials immediately. However, the account hit the login limits and has since been deactivated.
