Tinder users will now have better chatting tools, thanks to an upgraded messaging experience in the mobile dating app. Amida flurry of changesthat began rolling out last night to the iOS application, and soon Android,Tinder addedsupport for sending your matches GIFs. It also upgraded the size of emoji in chat and also now lets you like the individual messages you received from a match.On the more practical side of things, Tinder has finally addressed one of the bigger pain points with using its app  now, you can upload photos directly from your Camera Roll instead of relying on those imported from Facebook.This latter item has been something of an issue for Tinder, as many of those in its core demographic are not as active on Facebook as they are elsewhere (like Instagram). In addition, there are some photos users want to add to Tinder that they dont want to share more broadly on Facebook, forcing them to do things like change the privacy settings on a new upload picture to Only Me, for example, in order to import it into Tinder without their Facebook network seeing the item.Not surprisingly, this was one of Tinders most requested features.Meanwhile, on the messaging front, Tinder has tapped Giphy to power its new in-app GIF sharing feature which is accessed by way of anew GIF button next to the text input box. The app will also show a list of trending GIFs you can send to matches. Not only are GIFs fun, they also have the potential to help break the ice between two strangers, as they can be a playful way to start a conversation.The message liking option, too, is a small tweak that can be used to show interest and express a positive sentiment, even when youre not sure what to say back.Along with the larger emoji, these featurescould help increase engagement inTinders app, allowing users to spend more time texting and perhaps with less pressure to switch the conversation to SMS  something a lot of women in particular are hesitant to do ahead of meeting someone in person.Tinder tells us today that the average time spent in the app is more than an hour per day, so its already doing well in terms of engagement, however.Finally, the app has expanded its support for Apples 3D Touch, by allowing users to peek and pop on web links shared in conversations.These features (minus 3D Touch, of course), should roll out to Androidlater this morning, the company says.Tinder, which is now the flagship dating app in newly public IACs portfolio, doesnt disclose how many users it has, but its estimated to be as high as 50 million. The company did say in November, following news of its newmatching algorithm, that it has seen nearly 10 billion matches to date and makes 26 million matches daily.
