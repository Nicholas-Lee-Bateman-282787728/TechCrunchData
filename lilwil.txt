Liwil
Every student has a unique learning style, but its tough for teachers to figure out whetherthey learn best through lectures, images, reading, self-directed practice or group projects. By using publicly available education progress data and personality analysis, Lilwil is able to automatically identify the best teaching method for a student and recommend it to their instructor.Lilwil was one of the hundreds of projects built overnight at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY Hackathon. It could make schools more efficient, keep students engaged and make teaching more rewarding.Personalized learning is becoming a big trend in tech with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative pledging funding to develop software and strategies in the space.First, Lilwil used the HMHAPI which has data on the grades and assignments of students in a large percentage of public schools. It then applies IBMs Watson to assess the different personality traits of students based on their work such asopenness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and emotional range.Lilwil then presents a personality analysis to teachers, along with suggestions for the best methods for assisting that student.For example, Lilwil could identify higher levels of extraversion and conscientiousness in a student, and determine that theyre best taught through role-playing simulations and roundtable discussions.Two of the Lilwil teams founders,Lishing Chan andWill Ho,originally met in Singapore before coming to the U.S. Theyd both had bad experiences in school because they werent taught with strategies that matched their disposition.That can be especially problematic in countries like Malaysia where one of the founders grew up, considering students can be physically punished with caning for poor performance. Their experiences inspired them, along withLuis Bosquez,to build Lilwil so other students have a more adaptive journey through education.Many teachers stick with the tough job because they love watching children blossom. Lilwil could make it easier to unlock these students full potential, making the teaching profession more satisfyingand attractive to talent.Chan tells us We thought theres a better way to match learning styles and teaching methods to maximize how students learn. That group of students in primary and secondary school will be our workforce in the future!
