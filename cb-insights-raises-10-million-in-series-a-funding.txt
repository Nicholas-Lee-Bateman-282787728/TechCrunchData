CB Insights, anearly six-year-old, New York-based researchoutfitwhose private company data and analysis has become oft-cited in media reports about the startup industry, has raised $10 million in Series A funding from the low-flying, bi-coastal growth stage investment firm RSTP.According to CEO and cofounder Anand Sanwal, the money represents CB Insightss first equity round. The 61-person company had previously raised $1.15millionin grants from the National Science Foundation for itsprivate company scoring software, calledMosaic.The funding isnta complete surprise, given the venture capital that has flowed recently to other startups focused on private company data and analysis, including our own sister company, CrunchBase, which closed on roughly $6 million in funding from Emergence Capital Partners in September; and Mattermark, which closed on a$6.5 million Series A round led by Foundry Group last December.Still, Sanwal had been fairly public about running a largely bootstrapped company that was revenue funded and not supported instead by investor dollars. Asked why the company changed its mind, he says RSTP is a longtime customer of CB Insights that reached out probably two years ago about a potential investment. As the two sidesexchanged product and market ideas over time, bothdecided to move forward with a deal thats simple and fair to everyone, Sanwal says.CB Insight is a SaaS business. Itsstandard subscriptions range from $20,000 to 60,000 per year, with more custom enterprise subscriptions costing customers $100,000 or more.The company says it is profitable.Sanwal was previously a VP at American Express, co-leading a $50 million innovation fund with Jonathan Sherry, with whom he started CB Insights. He says the two witnessed firsthand how hard it was to understand private companies as a lender to them. Sanwal says theyalso founded CB Insights out of a shared frustrationwith offerings like those of incumbents Dow Jones and Thomson Reuters, two companies that have long tracked and sell information about the global private markets.
