Feel like youre pretty much never offline anymore? You have plenty of company, according to the Pew Research Center.According to a new survey of 2001 Americans ages 18 years and older, roughly 21 percent of U.S. adults now report that they go online almost constantly. An even larger number  42 percent  responded that they go online several times a day.Tellingly, just 10 percent go online about once a day,and 13 percent of people say they go online several times a week or less often. (We are curious to meet these people! We bet theyre very interesting.)Even though one-fifth of us feel like slaves to the interwebs, its particularly bad for younger adults. According to Pew, fully 36 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds say theyre online almost always, and half say that theyre jumping online multiple times a day.About 24 percent of teenagersmeanwhile say theyre online constantly, which is roughly in line withthose in the 30-years-old-and-older camp.The stats arent surprising, given that 75 percent of Americans now use a smartphone, tablet, or other mobile device that can be used at almost any time to keep from engaging with the rest of humanity.But heres something: According to a separate Pew study published a little earlier this year, seven in 10 American adults have also read a book within the past year, whether in whole or in part. Fully 63 percent of those were even books in print.
