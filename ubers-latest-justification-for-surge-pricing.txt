Uber would not be a reliable service if it didnt implement surge pricing. Well, at least thats what Uber is suggesting in its recent case study on surge pricing.Surge pricing is an increase of fare that kicks in when theres a high demand of Uber ride requests, but not a lot of drivers on the road.We found that, without surge pricing, Uber is not really Uber  you cant push a button and get a ride in minutes, Uber researchers Jonathan Hall and Cory Kendrick wrote on the Uber blog.To figure this out, Hall and Kendrick, along with University of Chicago Booth School of Business Assistant Professor of Marketing Chris Nosko, took a look at what happened when a glitch in Ubers system caused surge pricing to go down for 26 minutes in New York on New Years Eve last year, and compared that to a similar scenario in terms of demand (after an Ariana Grande concert ended) when surge pricing was working.When Uber experienced a surge outage on NYE,estimated times of arrival drastically increased and the number of rides completedfulfilled decreased. In fact, less than 25% of people who requested a ride were able to get one.Drivers were likely less attracted tothe platform while, at the same time, riders requested rides in increasing numbers because theprice mechanism was not forcing them to make the proper economic tradeoff between the trueavailability of driver partners and an alternative transportation option, Hall and Kendrick wrote. Because of theseproblems, completion rates fell dramatically and wait times increased, causing a failure of thesystem from an economic efficiency perspective.Compare that to the vitality of Ubers system when surge pricing works.So, Ubers surge pricing seems to be good for customers.That being said, a different study suggests that surge pricing doesnt actually increase the supply of drivers on the road. Instead, it just relocates the drivers who already on the road. If thats the case, that means people in other neighborhoods could get screwed over with longer wait times. In Ubers Ariana Grande example, it only looked at usage in a restricted geospatial bounding box containing Madison Square Garden, which is 5 avenues long and 15 streets wide. So, who knows what the ETAs and rides completed looked like in the rest of New York Citys boroughs.
