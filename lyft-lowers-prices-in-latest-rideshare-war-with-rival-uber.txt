Earlier this week I benefitted from a drop in Uber Pool pricing, noting my ride was a whole Starbucks medium-size latte less than Lyft Line. Lyft, fresh with a new billion dollars in funding, is now doing the same.Uber announced a reduction in price in more than 100 citiesin the U.S. and Canada last week, most likely prompting Lyft to figure out the measures it would have to take to not lose new ground.Pool currently a Starbucks tall latte cheaper than Line. Sarah Buhr (@sarahbuhr) January 13, 2016Its currently cheaper for me to take Line home  $5 vs. $8.21 in Uber Pool (God bless that VC money!).Lyft tells me this is about resolutions, neglecting any mention of rival competition.Despite the lowered cost, Lyft maintains it still pays drivers more than Uber, but the new pricing will affect drivers commissions. The new, lower prices will touch 33 cities nationwide and will affect D.C., Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose/Silicon Valley, Detroit and Baltimore the most.
