Online publishersare about to get a lot more options for embedding tweets in their stories, withTwitter announcinga new ecosystem of products around embedded tweets today at its Flight developer conference.The curation side of that ecosystem includes existing Twitter products like TweetDeck and Curator, which helps publishers find the best tweets to feature in their content. (Curator was first announced in March.)It also includes partnerships with companies likeSpredfast, Wayin, Dataminr, ScribbleLive and Flowics.Twitters Michael Ducker said that these are the same tools that Twitter uses to create its Moments, which pull tweets together around big news stories and trends. Twitter has done significant work to connect these products, so its not just a bunch of separate integrations, Ducker said.Twitter is also introducing a new tool for creating embeddable grids of Twitter content. Soif youre tired of justpublishing a stack of tweets, one on top of the other, you can also try presenting them in a grid format, like the example below. (Im guessing it works bestfor video- and image-driven tweets.)A Collection on TwitterIn his presentation, Ducker argued that embedded tweets have become the modern day pull quote and said Twitters aim is to turn them into a material part of publishers businesses. He also said theyre not just for news publishers  companies Angry Bird-maker Rovio have used them, as well.Embedded tweetsdont even have to be limited to websites and apps. Ducker also announced a partnership with JCDecaux to bring tweets to out-of-home digital displays.
