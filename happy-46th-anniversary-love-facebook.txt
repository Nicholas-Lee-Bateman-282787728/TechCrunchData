My good friend, who hasnt even been alive for 46 years, sent the following screenshot to me:She texted me, 46 years ago?!?! Fb you crazy! Trying to make me feel old, they are succeeding.Anyway, this appearsto be a widespread glitch across Facebook, with a good number of people taking to Twitterto share screenshots of their 46-year-long friendships, according to Facebook.Word on the street is that its due to some bug relating to Unix time, also known as Epoch time, which counts how many seconds have elapsed since Jan. 1, 1970.Thatwas about 46 years ago.Facebook spokesperson Chelsea Kohler provided TechCrunch with the following statement: Weve identified this bug and the teams fixing it now so everyone can ring in 2016 feeling young again.
