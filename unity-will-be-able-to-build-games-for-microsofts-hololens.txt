The Unity game engine is arguably the de facto standard for those dabbling inOculus Rift development.But that doesnt mean the Unity/Rift relationship is particularly exclusive  thats hardly Unitys style.Thus, Unity today announced support for an entirely different headset platform: Microsofts crazy hologram-style augmented reality headset, HoloLens.Unity is a game engine designed to kill off some of the pain points in game development. You design your game once in Unity, and then it ports to pretty much any popular platform (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and all of the next-gen consoles) with minimal code changes.HoloLens, meanwhile, is Microsofts insane-looking augmented reality headset that renders high-definition, hologram-style images into your environment. It was first announced back in January, with an availability window that basically works out to eventually.Unity says itll support all of HoloLens flagship features, including spatial mapping (allowing you to detect real world objects around you and render things accordingly), gaze (detecting where youre looking/focusing) and gesture/voice recognition.Before you rush off and update Unity: HoloLens support isnt publicly available yet. Its still in private alpha, and theres no timeframe mentioned for when it might be. Given that HoloLenss own release date is still up in the air, thats pretty reasonable  without a HoloLens to test on, Unity support isnt all that useful.
