With Edge in Windows 10, Microsoft has finally delivered a capable browser to replace the aging Internet Explorer. Microsoft likes Windows 10 so much, it makes Edge the default browser in Windows 10, even when youre updating from a system that previously usedChrome or Firefox as the default.Unsurprisingly, Mozilla is not amused and itsCEO Chris Beard today wrote an open letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to complain that the company is taking away its users choices and ignored Mozillas calls for keeping the default during the upgrade process.When we first saw the Windows 10 upgrade experience that strips users of their choice by effectively overriding existing user preferences for the Web browser and other apps, we reached out to your team to discuss this issue, Beard writes. Unfortunately, it didnt result in any meaningful progress, hence this letter.While it is technically possible for people to preserve their previous settings and defaults, the design of the new Windows 10 upgrade experience and user interface does not make this obvious nor easy, Beard writes.So to help users restore their defaults after upgrading to Windows 10, Mozilla has put together a step-by-step tutorial and video(which isnt riveting but does the trick).Beard, who calls this an aggressive move, urges Microsoft to change its business tactics. These changes arent unsettling to us because were the organization that makes Firefox, he writes. They are unsettling because there are millions of users who love Windows and who are having their choices ignored, and the increased complexity put into everyones way if and when they choose to make a choice different than what Microsoft prefers.Mozilla, though, its worth noting, also had a few issues lately. Its users were neither happy with its switch to Yahoo as the default search engine, nor with the integration of a WebRTC-based video chat tool and Pocket.When we asked Microsoft for a comment, we receivedthe following from a company spokesperson: We designed Windows 10 to provide a simple upgrade experience for users and a cohesive experience following the upgrade. During the upgrade, consumers have the choice to set defaults, including for web browsing. Following the upgrade, they can easily choose the default browser of their choice.As with all aspects of the product,we have designed Windows 10 as a service; if we learn from user experience that there are ways to make improvements, we will do so.
