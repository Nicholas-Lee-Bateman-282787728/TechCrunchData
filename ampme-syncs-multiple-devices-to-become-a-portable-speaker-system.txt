There are plenty of services out there that promise to sync up your devices to form a surround-sound speaker system.But AmpMe, an app that launched out of Montreal three months ago, claims to be the only one that can work across both iOS and Android.The company was founded by serial entrepreneur and angel investor Martin-Luc Archambault and has grown to over 1 million downloads in three months.The app is inherently viral because its useless unless your friends are using it, too, said Archambault.Heres how it works:Once youve downloaded the app, you sign in as a host and give a code to your friends. They input the code in the app and music is automatically synced among devices, both smartphones and tablets, to offer louder sound anywhere.We want to be a portable Sonos, said Archambault.In terms of music, users can play music files that are downloaded onto the device, as well as SoundCloud music and Songza playlists.The company says its working on adding integrations with other music services like Spotify and Apple Music.AmpMe  Be The Speakers from Martin-Luc Archambault on Vimeo.
