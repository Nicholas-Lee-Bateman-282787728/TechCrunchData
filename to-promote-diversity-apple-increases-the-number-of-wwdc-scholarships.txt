To encourage greater diversity amongst its developer community, Apple announced its increasing the number of WWDC scholarships this year which providestudents and developers the opportunity to attend ApplesWorldwide Developers Conferencetaking place this June in San Francisco.Last year, Apple offered200 scholarships by working with theNational Center for Women & IT (NCWIT). But this year, the company says it has expanded its list of partner STEM organizations to more than 20 and will also increase the number of scholarships offers to 350.The full listSTEM organizations includesApp Camp for Girls,Black Founders,Black Girls Code,Blacks in Technology,Coalition for Queens,Code.org,Code2040,CodeNow,Girl Develop It,Girls Who Code,Hack the Hood,Hack bright Academy,LaTechLa,Latinos in Information,Science and Technology Association (LISTA),National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT),National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE),Technovation,Thurgood Marshall College Fund,Women Who Code, and#YesWeCode.Like many of todays tech companies, Apples workforce is primarily white and male  specifically, according to Apples own diversity report, only 30% of its company is female. In technology positions, thatnumber is even lower  only 20% of its employees are female, in that case. Meanwhile, Apples overall makeup is55% white, 15% Asian, 11% Hispanic, and 7% black.This lack of diversity isnt just a social justice issue  not having the right balance internally can also limit a companys potential for new ideas and innovations, which ultimately could affect a businesss bottom line.One more minor example that has popped up as of late that reflects a product built by a predominantly male culture, is the lack of consideration for womens health needs following the introduction of Apples HealthKit. Apples Health app can now track a range of items, including sleep, weight, sleep, heart rate, and more  even things like sodium, copper, and selenium intake. But as a number of people havepointed out, the app failed to track one of the most obvious and necessary things related to womens health: her period. Thats the kind of oversight that comes from a workplace where there simply arent enough women making their voices heard.With the new scholarships and partner STEM organizations involved, Apple is taking broad steps to make access to its event  and therefore its larger developer community and the potential for future success in the industry  something that reaches a more diverse crowd of young developers, including not only women, but also black and Latino groups as well. At this years WWDC, Apple will offer over 100 technical sessions presented by Apple engineers, who explain how best to use the companys developer tools. These sessions and the hands-on labs are a big draw for attendees, but also important is the opportunity to network with fellow developers and establish industry contacts that can help developers further their careers.Apple says thescholarships are open to students and members or alumni of the STEM organizations Apple has selected, and are available to those over the age of 13. In addition, unlike regular WWDC attendees, these scholarship recipients wont have to be a member of one of Apples paid developer programs. However, interested student developers will have to create and submit an app in order to be considered for a scholarship.Additional guidelines that explain the app submission process have also been shared here on Apples Developer website, and statethat submitted Mac or iOS apps must be written in Objective-C and Swift, or written entirely in Swift.These submissions will be accepted beginning on Wed., April 22nd and will end on Sunday, April 26 at 5 PM PDT.
