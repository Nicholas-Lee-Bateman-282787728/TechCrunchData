As a proud member of the NYC tech community, Im truly thrilled to announce that well be bringing our world-renowned TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off to the best damn city in the world on August 18. This wont be our first meetup in NYC  we held one all the way back in 2012, before we had figured out the whole pitch-off bit, and again in March of 2014  but I can promise you that this one will be the best TCNYC Meetup weve ever had. No idea what Im talking about? Ill start from the top. The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off is a regional event that we throw, where people can hang out, get a little boozy (21+ only please), and network with their fellow tech nerds. To up the ante a bit, we turn the event into a live competition, giving 10 companies exactly 60 seconds to pitch their product live on stage. A panel of expert judges, including founders, local VCs, and TC editors, will conduct a brief Q&A after every pitch, and eventually choose a winner. And yes, there are prizes. If that sounds like something you want to be a part of, please click this link and apply to participate in the Pitch-Off. (Applications close in two weeks, on Friday July 24, so dont you tarry.) First place will receive a table in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco, which comes with two tickets to the event. Second place will receive two tickets to the Disrupt SF conference in September, and the Audience Choice winner will receive one ticket to the big show. Our judges are currently being finalized, so I cant quite share who they will be, but based on preliminary discussions I can tell you that theyre some of the coolest judges weve ever had on stage for a Pitch-Off. As per usual, Ill be your host. The NYC Meetup + Pitch-off will be held at Le Poisson Rouge on Bleecker Street on August 18. Doors open at 6pm, and tickets cost $25.Cant wait to see you there!
