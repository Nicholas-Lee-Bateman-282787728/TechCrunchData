Chevy announced earlier this year it would be bringing Apples CarPlay to production vehicles this year, and now those first cars with the infotainment feature from Apple are rolling off the line and going out to dealerships and consumers. The very first production Chevrolet with CarPlay installed was the silver, 650-HP Corvette Z06 pictured above and below, the company tells TechCrunch.CarPlay made its official debut at Apples Spring Update event backin 2014, where the company first revealed how it would be translating the iPhone user experience for use with in-dash displays, both on new vehicles and aftermarket solutions. So far, rollout of new vehicles with the software actually enabled for end-users have been slow (the Ferrari FF is the only confirmed one so far), but Chevrolets production shipments represent the beginning of whats likely to become a widespread trend.At the end of 2014, we were able to test one of the first Pioneer in-dash aftermarket receivers to ship with CarPlay support, and found the system promising but still showing its relative youth. Inclusion in production vehicles should help Apple better direct its future development, but the iPhone maker already revealed at WWDC this year that it will be adding dynamic support from different display sizes and aspect rations, and that auto makers will be able to create their own CarPlay apps to control in-cabin functions like AC.
