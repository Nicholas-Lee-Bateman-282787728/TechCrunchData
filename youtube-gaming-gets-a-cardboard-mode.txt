YouTube Gaming, Googles answer to Twitch, is trying to stay ahead of the curve by adding new functionality quickly. One such feature is only available for Android right now, and its a Cardboard Mode that allows you to watch any video with a theater-type big-screen setting feel.
Itll feel like youre sitting and watching a big screen. While the gameplay recording feature only supports 2D recording right now, one could expect that VR with full 360 degree/stereoscopic 3D video will be coming sometime in the future.Put simply, YouTube and Google arent waiting around to see what happens with virtual reality. Theyre going to swing for the fences.
