Microsoft today announced the next major update of Windows 10 at its Build developer conference in San Francisco. The Windows 10 Anniversary Update is scheduled to arrive  you guessed it  on the one-year anniversary of the Windows 10 launch: later this summer. Windows 10 launched on July 29, so thats probably the date.Many of the new feature will, of course, roll out to Windows Insiders ahead of the launch date. Indeed, most of them will start rolling out today. The update, just like preview ones, will be available for free and will come to all Windows devices, including Xbox One and HoloLens.Microsoft says it will offer new features for its Hello login feature, improved pen support, an improvedCortana, and more.Because Microsoft has switched to regular updates, these major point updates feel almost like an anachronism. But there is still some value in having these major releases on at least an annual schedule so both developers and users can get up to speed with where their operating system is going.
