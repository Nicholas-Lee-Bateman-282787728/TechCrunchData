 The folks at Gate want you to know when the postman is coming. Their new product, available now on Kickstarter, is a smart mailbox sensor that tells you when someone is digging in your post box or dropping off letters.The system, which mounts to both traditional rural mailboxes as well as in-door flap models, pings you when the mail is coming and can even estimate an ETA for your next delivery. While I cant imagine wanting to know when my mail was coming with any degree of accuracy, there are plenty of people and places where the mail-persons visit is an important part of their day.Early adopters can grab it for $199 right now and it installs in a few minutes and charges via solar. It ships in December.
