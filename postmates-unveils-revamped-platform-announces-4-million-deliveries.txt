Postmates recently unveiled a revamped version of its app, dubbed Postmates 3.0, which features category discovery, delivery tracking, gifting and estimated delivery times.In addition to providing customers with timely information, one of the reasons why Postmates added estimated delivery times is to adjust customers expectations. Most of our deliveries are not just under an hour. Theyre significantly under an hour, Postmates Director of Product Sara Mauskopf told me. For whatever reason, the branding with Postmates has always been under an hour, which is kind of selling ourselves short because if you want something in 35 minutes, you can actually get that from the Grilled Cheese Kitchen.But, perhaps more importantly, its now possible to search and browse Postmates merchants by category. I have a number of friends who didnt knowPostmates is capable of delivering more than just food. Postmates couriers also pick up and deliver anything from computer chargers to prescriptions.So, unsurprisingly, food is the most popular delivery category on Postmates. But now that categories are in place, that couldchange. Theres also now a special section to view all the merchants that offer delivery for just $4.99. Postmates doesnt have flat delivery fees, but instead chargesbased on demand and the distance between the pick-up and drop-off location.Postmates recently completed 4 million deliveries andlaunched in 10 additional cities last week, bringing the total number of major cities it operates in up to 40.Postmates also recently announced a partnership with Walgreensto offer on-demand delivery of itsfull catalog of items. To date, Postmates has raised $138 million from investors like Tiger Global, Spark Capital, Harmony Partners, Founders Fund and Crosslink Capital.
