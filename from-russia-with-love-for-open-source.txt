The U.S. mobile ecosystem duopoly has been the big story of tech for the past six-plus years. And continues to be mobiles unshakeable reality  with Android and iOS collectively cutting themselves a 96 per centshare of the device market(per Gartnerfigures for Q3 2014).Not everyone is happy about this lack of geopolitical diversity in the mobile space, though. Russia for one wants to see less U.S.-centricity, at least domestically  and is apparently willing to dip into its pockets to encourage developers to migrate apps to other mobile platforms.Specifically Russia wants to support the Samsung-led Tizen open source effort, and also JollasSailfish OS  which has been developed in Europe (Finland), and is an extension of theopen source MeeGo project (although notably Sailfish is not (yet) itself open sourced).Tweeting from a conference at the weekend, Nikolai Nikiforov, theRussian Federations Minister of Communications and Mass Communications, calledfor the de-monopolization of the global IT ecosystem  and expressed support for the Linux-based Tizen OS, tweeting a hands-on photoof himself using thenew open source operating system:   -           #Tizen pic.twitter.com/CqdjofsMEH   (@nnikiforov) February 5, 2015In the same series of tweets,Nikiforov revealed the Russian Federation intends to provide grants to homegrown developers to migrate their apps from the dominant U.S. mobile platforms to Tizen and Sailfish. An onlinetranslation of his below tweet reads: We give grants to developers who will migrate their applications from Android and iOS monopoly in independent Tizen and Sailfish:@dryab @ekozlov    ,       Android  iOS   Tizen  Sailfish   (@nnikiforov) February 7, 2015Healso retweeted a news story announcing the launch of another open source effort, Canonicals first Ubuntu smartphone  which is due to go on sale in Europe in the next few days  suggesting that platform may also end up finding friends in the Russian Federation.Samsungfinally launched its first Tizen smartphone last month, in India. (An early Ars Technicareviewdubs it a bad Android clone.) And Tizen devices remain limited in their geographic availability at this point. But in another tweet Nikiforov suggests Tizen deviceswill be launching widelin Russia soon:@dryab @ekozlov     #Tizen  #SailfishOS         (@nnikiforov) February 7, 2015The Korean companyis Tizens sole champion at this point  well, along with the Russian Federation now  but in another tweet Nikiforov notes the open source foundation of the platform leaves room for others to get involved bycontributing source code:@tikhonovilya 2. #Samsung  #        #Tizen,            (@nnikiforov) February 8, 2015Nikiforovreiterates the samesentiment with Sailfish, which launched its first smartphone last year (and is in the process of crowdfunding a tablet). Yetarguesthat Android  which also of course hasan open source foundation  is increasingly tightly controlled by the U.S. company, pointing to Google blocking Acer from launching rival mobiledevices back in 2012 and noting how many Google services device makers are required to pre-loadin order to gain access to Googles Play Store. He goes on todubthe platform the supposedly open Android OS.Russian publication Hi-Tech.Mail.ru notes thatNikiforov has expressed suspicion of closed source platforms before, noting he held meetings withApple and SAP last year to ask tobe able to inspect source codefor backdoors and hidden features  invoking the 2013 disclosuresby NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden of U.S. government digitalsurveillance dragnets.Its not clear how much money the Russian Federation intends tothrow behind the mobile markets non-U.S. underdogs via app developer grants at this point. Weve reached out toNikiforov with questions and will update this article with any response.In another tweet he notes that thegrants will be for Russian developers only  so the focus is on encouraging a viable local alternative mobile ecosystemwhilesupporting Russias domestic IT industry  as youd expect from the Minister involved. Where theres politics, there is alwayseconomics.
