Twitter just announced an expansion of its Amplify ad program that should make it accessible to more publishers and advertisers.Amplify is the companys two-year-old program for video ads. Initially, it involved a direct and somewhat complicated relationship  the publisher would embed a short video clip in a tweet, then the advertiser would both include a short pre-roll ad in the tweet and pay to promote the tweet in Twitter.In the new, open version of Amplify, an advertiser no longer needs to work witha specific publisher. Instead, they choose a content category, then Twitter will automatically include their pre-roll ads in videos tweeted by relevant publishers. (Advertisers can also use Twitters other ad targeting capabilities at the same time.)This isnt just about making the process easier for advertisers  it also gives publishers a monetaryincentive to share their video clips on Twitter. Weve heard that the revenue split is 70 percent for publishers and 30 percent for Twitter, and that publishers will be able to blacklist certain advertisers or categories if they feel like theyre not a good fit.With this expanded version of Amplify, were excited to help people enjoy more great video, publishers drive more revenue, and brands align with the best mobile video moments, all at scale, wrote David Reagan, a senior product manager at Twitter, in a company blog post.Publishers participating in the expanded Amplify program include companiesin sports (Sports Illustrated, Fox Sports and SB Nation), TV (Billboard Music Awards, Fox and MTV), digital (Maker, Fullscreen and Kin Community) and news and entertainment (Funny or Die, BuzzFeed and TechCrunch  yes, the site youre reading right now).Twitter made the announcement at an event for advertisers and marketers in New York City, where executives also talked about the broader vision for video on Twitter.The new Amplify program is currently in beta testing with a limited set of publishers and advertisers in the United States, with plans to expand globally.Heres a clip ofBaljeet Singh explaining the latest on Twitter Amplify.Baljeet Singh shares the latest on Twitter Amplify: http://t.co/Ip0Q8PzuKg Twitter Advertising (@TwitterAds) October 8, 2015Update: COO Adam Bain ended by the event by announcing that Twitter will be opening up a beta for Promoted Moments later this year.
