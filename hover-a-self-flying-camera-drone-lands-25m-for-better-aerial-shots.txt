Have you ever tried to capture close-up video of yourself or others with a traditional drone? Its nearlyimpossible.To solve this problem China-based Zero Zero Robotics has raised $25M to build Hover, a small self-flying drone.The funding is composed mainly of a $23M Series Around from IDG, and China-focusedfirmsGSR Ventures, ZhenFund, ZUIG.While this is the first publicly announced funding by the company, Zero Zero has been working on this technology since 2014 with a team of roughly 70 people. Hover is their first drone,but expect to see itsself-flying capabilities replicated in future products from the company.Hover packs a 13MP camera sensor is4K video capable,and also hasa bunch of smart software that lets it capture video with minimal human interaction.And while it doesnt have a mechanical gimbal likesome larger drones, the company says its custom electronic image stabilizationwill be enough to correct any shake from captured footage.In addition to the stabilization software,Hover will come with a handful of preprogrammed features that should make it easy for anyone to fly, even if they dont have experience piloting a traditional quadcopter. These include hover in place, face and body recognition and following, and 360 pano recording.Hover, which looks almost like a router when folded up, will be super lightweight.In fact, the 240g weight (just over half a pound) means it wont have to be registered with the FAA. While this may not matter much to the typical drone hobbyist, it will be a compelling sell to customers who havent had prior experience with drones, and dont want the hassle of registering with a government agency.Hoverwill ship this summer,and stay tunedfor a closer look once we get our hands on a demo unit.
