Disrupt SF is only a few weeks away now and our agenda is shaping up nicely. Among the speakers at this years event are CloudFlare co-founders Matthew Prince and Michelle Zatlyn.CloudFlare, which offers both content distribution and security tools for web sites, is near and dear to our hearts because the company launched as a Disrupt Battlefield company almost exactly five years ago.At the time, CloudFlare was the runner-up to a startup called Qwiki (which turned out to be a bit of a disappointment and was later acquired  and shut down  by Yahoo).Despite not winning (and Prince once told me that he was happy the company didnt, because it could barely cope with demand even after coming in second), the company has gone on to now shape a huge amount of the traffic that moves across the Internet every day. The company saysmore than 2 million web properties currently use its services.Over the last five years, CloudFlare raised $72.1 million in venture fundingand now has a presence in 43 data centers around the world.At Disrupt, well talk to the co-founders about what it takes to run a fast-growing startup and what theyve learned fromtheir own five-year startup journey.Disrupt SF will roll through town from September 21st to the 23rd, right over at Pier 70. Weve only announced a handful of speakers so far, but the lineup is already fantastic:Sam Altman! Troy Carter! Aileen Lee!You dont want to miss it.
