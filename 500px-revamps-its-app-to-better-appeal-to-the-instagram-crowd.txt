500px, the online photo-sharing community thatrecently raised another $13 million to challenge Flickr and Getty, is today rolling out a significant changeto its mobile application. Beginning with an update on iOS, the company has completely redesigned and rebuilt its app from the ground up, in an effort thats focused on making its app appeal to a more mainstream consumer base.With the revamp, the company hopes to appeal to the Instagram crowd  or at least to those who are ready to expand their understanding of photography, while still enjoying social features like following other users or favoriting photos they like.With the update, the company hopes to become known among a broader user base, explains 500px CEO Andy Yang. The service, he says, is for those who want to take their creativity to the next levelto learn about photography, learn about editing and visual creativity  thats where we want to position ourselves, he says.The updated app introduces a number of new features and improvements to existing features which are aimed at a mainstream user base. For starters, theres now an all-new home feed where youll see a combination of photos from people you follow alongside personalized recommendations based on your activities, which is meant to enhance discovery. An improved Discover section meanwhile includes a Debut feature, which highlights new creators in the community.Search and user profiles have also been improved, and 500px is now including a better photo uploader that lets you import from your Camera, Photo Gallery, or Adobe Lightroom. For creators, there are also advanced editing tools and presets provided by Adobe in the new experience.The app also features a refreshed design language that has more polish  another change thats also meant to appeal to a broader community.To date, 500px has been largely known as a Flickr competitor aimed at the more professional crowd, and this community also helps fuel its ability to generate revenue.The 500px business model relies on its marketplace wherephotographers and their fans can buy and sell photos  in fact, new strategic investor Visual China (like Chinas Getty Pictures) began distributing 500pxs photos following the newfunding round.However, the majority of 500pxs user base is surprisingly not pro photographers, but rather photo enthusiasts.Explains Yang,10 to 20 percent we would say are pro or very serious hobbyist amateurs, and the rest would be morephotography enthusiasts, casual [users who] have an appreciation for photography.In other words, like every other internet service, 500pxs content creators are the minority. So the new app is meant to make photo consumption a better experience for the masses, while gently pushing them to become content creators themselves with the addition of better uploading and editing tools.That, in turn, will help feed more photos into the marketplace as more of the casual users are inspired to participate, the company believes.The updated iOS app is live today, but an Android version is due later this year. 500px is also working on a website revamp, too, but it was not ready at this time.
