There are two kinds of people: those who are sick of all this Star Wars news nonsense, and those who just want to avoid any spoiler before seeing Star Wars Episode VII. In both cases, youre in luck because the Jitbit co-founders have something for you  the Star Wars Spoiler Blocker extension.Alex Jumaev and Max Al Farakh released a Chrome extension in the Chrome store that does one thing but does it well. Whenever you end up on a page that mentions Star Wars, the extension will take over your screen and show you a warning screen.The potential spoilers ahead screen is much better than having to block your display with your arms and screaming Nooo! so that you avoid accidentally reading crucial information on the most-anticipated movie of the year.Once you install the extension, there isnt any option or configuration screen. You can go on with your life. It looks like the extension does a quick keyword search on every page that you load to see if it mentions Star Wars. It can overreact a bit as a friend mentioning buying Star Wars tickets on Facebook will trigger the spoiler screen for example. But its worth it in case you really want to avoid spoilers but dont want to move off the Internet for weeks.As for Star Wars haters, the extension might help you close tabs so that you dont waste time on yet another Star Wars article. I hope you have other things that make you happy in your life, because Star Wars is pretty good. You should give it a try.Star Wars Spoiler Blocker isnt as sophisticated as Cloud To Butt Plus, but it gets the job done. Oh, by the way, Spock will make a comeback in Episode VII. Sorry for the spoiler
