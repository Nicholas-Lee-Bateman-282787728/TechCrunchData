On the heels of Dell buying EMC for $67 billionandWestern Digital buying SanDisk for $19 billion,HP is selling off its TippingPoint network security businessto TrendMicro for $300 million. TippingPoint isa provider of next-generation intrusionsystems and network security solutions, and HP says that in future it will resell network security services from partners (including TrendMicro) rather than own its own assets.The move comes in advance of HP completing a break-up of its business into PC and corporate services, a move it announced last yearwould be complete by the end of this fiscal year.HP was rumored in September to be shoppingTippingPoint for between $200 million and $300 million. The deal is expected to close by the end of Q4.Trend Micro says that the deal will includesecurity technology, IP, industry expertise and TippingPoints customer base. It will be combining TippingPoints business with its existing network security operations in a new business unit called Network Defense.At the same time,HP says that it is pulling out of havingits own network security business and will instead partner withthird parties for such servicesso we can invest in other areas of our security portfolio. HP says that after the deal closes it will continue to partner with TippingPoint as a strategic customer and partner.Trend Micro and HP havehad a strategic partnership in place since2014. Trend Micro is positioning this as its way of completing therange of security solutionsthat they can offer to enterprises, while keeping some continuity in the HP relationship.Organizations need a layered threat defense working seamlessly across the enterprise to address threats before, during and after an attack, said Eva Chen, CEO of Trend Micro in a statement. Thisnew next-generation network defense solution combines our best-in-class network breach detection system, with proven intrusion prevention and response capabilities from TippingPoint. Given our tenure with both HP and TippingPoint technology, we are excited about the agility of this acquisition and the value it will create for customers.The rise in cloud computing and IP-everything has led to an increase in malicious hacking and other cybercrime, and that in turn has led to a much larger priority for network security investments among enterprises.But at the same time, as the space becomes more sophisticated, it looks likewe may see yet more companies emerge that focus just on security rather than trying to offer a full stack of IT services.TippingPoint became a part of HP in 2010, when its previous owner 3Com was acquired by HP for $2.7 billion. Before that, 3Com bought TippingPoint in 2005 for $442 million  making todays $300 million price something of a steal.
