If you play video games, chances are youve played Ubisofts Assassins Creed. After all, its one of the most popular video game franchises in history, with over 73 million copies sold. You might be surprised to learn, however, that Michael Fassbender (the actor and producer charged with turning that video game into a feature film) only started playing the game a few months ago. I hadnt played it before these guys approached me, he told Entertainment Weekly. Fassbender will be playing the role of Callum Lynch. If that doesnt ring a bell, well, it shouldnt. Callum Lynch isnt necessarily a character from the game, but takes on the role of the first-person action that the player would usually assume in the game. Marion Cotillard, Michael Kenneth Williams and Ariane Labed are also starring in the film. The first picture of the movie, which you can see above, was released yesterday in the EW interview.
