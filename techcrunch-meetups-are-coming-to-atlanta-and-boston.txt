The TechCrunch Meetups in Atlanta and Boston are approaching rapidly, which means that you need to move fast if you dont want to be left out.In case you havent heard of the TC Meetups before, heres a quick refresher:Weve been running regional TechCrunch Meetups for the past three years in various cities across the globe. The purpose is to bring together the local community, get to know you guys, and see what youre working on. We also hold a pitch-off at the very beginning of the meetup, wherein about a dozen companies have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product to a panel of expert judges, including TC staffers and local VCs.The winners get tickets to the world-renowned Disrupt conference in New York and the right to brag to their friends.Fun, right?Apply here for Atlanta and here for Boston.Were starting down south where weve had some of our most memorable meetups ever, visiting Atlantas Prive at 960 Spring St. NW on February 24, from 6pm to 10pm.Then, well head right back up to the North East to check out the latest and greatest startups out of Boston.
