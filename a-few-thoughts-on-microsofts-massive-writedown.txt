This morning marked along-awaited financial mess for Microsoft, which wrote down more than $7 billion of goodwill relatedto its purchase of the majority of Nokias hardware business.The charge was not a surprise. The scale of the dismissal was; the total sum deleted is larger than the originally reported purchase price of the assets in question.Math can be both poetic, and ironic. To see it manage both qualities at the same time in this case is, well, both poetic and ironic. (You can go meta in either direction, though you risk tautology and recursion, in equal sums.)Regardless, Microsoft continued its hedge clearing by announcing that it will cede 7,800 employees to other companies, while taking a roughly $800 million charge on top of the writedown. So, to be clear, Microsofts earnings on a normal accounting (GAAP) basis are hosed in the current quarter.On a cash basis, Microsoft is in fine shape. Taking into account intangibles, this is going to hurt its period-EPS. Such is life.Microsoft has been here before with aQuantive, so I doubt that its investors are too shocked. Still, a few notes are worth our time. Well use bullet points to save time:The new question is how Microsoft manages to sort its hardware work in this new reality. What will Satya do? The company declined to make him available for an interview, but I have a thought: When you are desperate to change your single-sale business into a subscription run-rate, you are penny-conscious. And everything that is a detriment to that business model shakeup has to go.
