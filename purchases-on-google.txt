Google today announced a new feature called Purchases on Google, which will make it easier for consumers to buy products directly from mobile search ads.The Wall Street Journal first reported that this was in the works back in May, with Google confirming the broad strokes of the news later that month.For consumers, this will mean that youll see be a buy buttonin some promoted mobile search results, taking you toa page where you can buy the advertised product. To be clear, the merchants will still handle the actual product fulfillment, although the pages will be hosted by Google. The companyemphasized that its trying to reduce the friction in mobile purchases without interfering in the relationship between merchants and consumers. Thats why the purchase page will carry the merchants branding, and if the product isnt exactly what the shopper is looking for, theyll even be able to search for other products.At a press event in New York City this morning, Google said its testing this feature with a dozen or so retail partners over the next few weeks, with plans to then make this more broadly available to advertisers in the United States, and much more scale throughout the United States by late 2015 or early 2016.Update: You can read more about Purchases on Google, and other shopping-related updates, in this Google blog post.
