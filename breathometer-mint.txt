A couple of years ago, a company called Breathometer came up with a portable breathalyzer you could plug into your phone and quickly get your blood alcohol level. At the time it seemed like a bit of a novelty device, but the company has continued to innovate on the technology its built. After raising some cash in part thanks to an appearance on Shark Tank, the company went back to the drawing board and built a new and improved $100 Bluetooth-powered breathalyzer it calls Breeze.But it did more than that: Breathometer created a platform it could use to measure lots of different things through their breath. With that foundation, the company has announced its next product  a device called Mint than can measure your breath quality and hydration.I stopped by the Breathometer booth in the Health and Wellness section of CES Tech West show floor and got to try out an early prototype of the Mint. The result? No surprise, but after a full day of eating crappy food, drinking coffee and not brushing my teeth, my breath was less than perfect.Breathometer CEO Charles Michael Yim says oral health can be a pretty good indicator of your overall health. The company hopes that by making people more aware of it they can improve the quality of their lives. Like like its first product, Breathometer has turned to crowdfunding site Indiegogo to find backers for Mint. Its going to sell for $99, but the first 500 backers can get a discounted rate of $89. To back the product, which is expected to ship in August, you can check out the Indiegogo campaign here.
