You can now message your friends on the webversion of Peach, a new chat app created by the founder of Vine, Dom Hofmann.The iOS app became a viral hit in Silicon Valley after it first launched at the beginning of this year. Someone else even made an unofficial web and Android version of the app called Nectarine.Some think Peach has already used up its 15 minutes of tech fame, and according to App Annie, downloads took a sharp nose dive last week.What you can do (for now) is upload GIFs and links to the web platform, andHofmanns GitHub indicates there are plans in the works to open it up to developers to improve the online version.According to the Peach team, an Android app is also in the works.But is the app already dead? It picked up some good initial traction and quickly hit the App Stores top 10 social network apps list. But our attention spans for these types of apps are short and it already took a tumble. Well just have to wait and see if the web version sweetens downloads once again.Update: Even though Hoffman is the creator of Peach and created this web version he wanted us to note he does not consider this an official version.
