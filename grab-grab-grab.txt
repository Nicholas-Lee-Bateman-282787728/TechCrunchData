GrabTaxi, the Uber rival inSoutheast Asia backed by SoftBank and Chinas Didi Kuaidi,will be now be known as Grab after the company announced a rebranding today alongsidea few new services.The company said its new name reflects the fact that it no longer only offers licensed taxi rides, the service that it started out working with. And thats indeed true. Over the past year or two, it has expanded its offeringsto include private cars (GrabCar), motorbike taxis (GrabBike), delivery (GrabExpress) and  most recently  carpooling with GrabHitch. In addition, the company was still known asMyTeksi in Malaysia, where it originated, so that confusion will be removed, too.Weve grown over the years  and were now much more than a taxi app. This new brand is animportant evolution that represents our goal to outserve our customers. We are not onlyproviding passengers with a transport service, we are saving them time and ensuring they havea safe ride, Anthony Tan, Group CEO and Co-Founder of Grab, said in a statement.According to its latest numbers, Grab  which is valued at over $1 billion based on past funding rounds  has over 200,000 drivers on its platform with more than 11 million app downloads to date across it six markets in Southeast Asia.Beyond the new name  which, to be honest, Im not a big fan of since grab is a fairly arbitrary term thats ripe for humor  the company also officially announced a service for corporate customers, which had been in beta, andits cashless payment service, which had also been in trial. Cashless payments will initially be supported in Singapore, with Indonesia,Philippines and Malaysia addedinFebruary and Thailand andVietnam in the first half of 2016.Finally, the service itself has been tweaked with Grab telling us that it now includes an auto-retry feature for when a booking isnt made immediately, better driver tracking, and flash  a service that automatically scans all rides types in the area to faster find the best vehicle for users in their locality.Earlier this month, Grab announced an office in Seattle aimed at supplementing its team in Southeast Asia with talent from the U.S.
