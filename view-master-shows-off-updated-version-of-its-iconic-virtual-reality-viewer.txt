Mattels View-Master Virtual Reality headsetis getting some new upgrades thatwill likely cement it as one of the best Cardboard viewers on the market when it launches this fall.It was just last week that the viewer earned the milestone designation of beingthe first piece of virtual reality-focused hardware to be sold in-store and online byApple. Now, the companyisshowingoff a preview of itsnewest hardware, the ViewerDLX, at the New York Toy Show.The current iteration retails for $30 (though it generally goes for much cheaper on Amazon).Gizmodo reports that the DLX will run a bit more expensive at $40, but some notable upgrades come with the price hike.The Viewer DLX makes up for a few of the slightly annoying quirks of the original. It now allows you to use headphones with the device rather than rely on the muffled sound produced by the phone stereo speaker inside the enclosure. It also is now sporting improved optics thanks to better lenses and a focal adjustment on the top of the device.New York Toy Fair just got the first look!

That being said, some headsetsoutshine others.Mattel really surprised people when it introduced the View-Master Virtual Reality and showed off what a high-quality product the cutesy retro headset was, now the company has seen its success and is improving on the design with the Viewer DLX.
