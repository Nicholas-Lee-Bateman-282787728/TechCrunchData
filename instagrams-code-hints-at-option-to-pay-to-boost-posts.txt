Weve known for some time that Instagram will soon be introducing business profiles, analytics and features intended to improve the ad-buying experience on the Facebook-owned photo-sharing network. Now, a number of other undocumented, non-public features have been uncovered, following a decompiling of the latest Instagram application, including one that hints that Instagram plans to offer an optionto boost posts on its network.The latest build of the Instagram app (version 8.1.0) was decompiled last night by Elliott Murray, the head of innovation at social media agency Social Chain a companythat you may remember fromthe BuzzFeed profilethat examined both the servicesheavyinfluenceover Twitter trends as well as its questionable tactics. It makes sense, given the agencys management of a number of top accountsacross social networks, including Instagram, that it would be especially interested in the services future plans and features.Murray found several boolean variablesin the apps code that could be set to true or false, the most interesting of which is one namedcan_boost_post.The most likely explanation for this variable is that it refers to Instagrams plan to allow users to pay to boost their posts reach across the Instagram network, Murray explains. Facebook today allows something similar, but Instagram had yet to offer the same feature for its own advertisers.What we dont know at this time is whether any user will be able to boost their posts, or it if this feature would only be available to an approved advertiser. (Facebook killed off the Highlight feature that let regularusers pay to boost their posts, but Instagram doesnt have different classes of users as of right now. The concern is that by allowing common users to pay for more visibility, Instagram could feel like less of an even playing field.)Boosting posts on Instagram has been the subject of advertisers requests for some time  on a post on Facebooks help site, for example, a question about whether this functionality was available was met by a number of users responding +1, I want that, looking for that too and so on. But for the time being, Instagram simply allows Facebookadvertisers to make ads that appear in users Instagram feeds, where theyre marked as Sponsored. These ads can be boosted, but theres not a direct way to boost an individual Instagram post.The ability to boost posts is even more in demand thanks to Instagrams recent change to its algorithm, which will no longer show posts in chronological order, but rather will feature best posts first  meaning those that best match users personal interests, as on Facebooks News Feed. Instagram pros and brandssubsequently freaked out about the change, and beggedusers to turn on notifications so they wouldnt miss their posts. Clearly, this portion of the user base is poised to become paying advertisers if a boost post option became available.In addition to the can_boost_post variable, Murray also found other references to the forthcoming analytics system and business profiles, including those that would enable the ability to view organic insights (Instagrams analytics), show the insights terms and convert accounts to business accounts. The latter suggests that after business profiles go live, businesses on Instagramwill either have the option to convert their account to a business profile, or will be required to do so.Instagram declined to offer comment on these findings.Additional reporting: Josh Constine
