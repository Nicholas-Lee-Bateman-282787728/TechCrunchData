Ever since our contact lists moved out of Rolodexes and onto our smartphones, mobile app developers have been trying to improve upon the built-in  and typically, very basic  address book apps that ship with our devices. To date, weve seen everything from simple makeovers of the address book app aimed at improving ease-of-use to smarter, connected address books that automatically stay up to date (and, unfortunately, sometimes spam your friends).Today, the co-founder of LogMeIn, Marton Anka, is introducinghis own take on the next generation address book with the debut of Caret, a social app thatincludes theability to share your availability information with those you trust.The idea behind Caret is to combine whats historically been a more static database of contacts with social networking features, automation and location services in order to offer users a more intelligent tool for reaching out to their friends, family and business contacts.The address book integrates with users existing contact lists on their mobile device, and then places all those contacts into a default group that can then see your basic status  like available or unavailable, similar to a messaging app like WhatsApp. Users can also see your current location by country level (e.g. the U.S.), plus time zone and weather information.This offers all your contacts some high-level information about where you are today, though if you want to stop users from even seeing anything at all, you can block them.Where Caret gets more interesting, however, is when you start sorting contacts into other groups in order to provide them with additionalinformation about your availability, location, and current status.All this information is turned into automatic status updates Caret posts on your behalf, with only those you specify gaining access to the most personal information.To make this possible, theapp taps into smartphone sensors. For example, if the devices GPS detects youre moving at more than 10 MPH, then Caret can show a trusted contact that youre currently in a vehicle and may not be able to respond immediately to an incoming call or text. In another example, if you turn your phone face down while in a meeting, Caret will inform your colleagues that youre not available.The app can also tap into your calendar to display free/busy information to business colleagues, or even event details to a highly trusted contact, like your spouse.Before anyone can see things like your exact location or event details, for example, you have to explicitly add them to the appropriate group.The VIP group, which will likely only include family members  like a significant other, offers a slew of detailed information including call status, street level location (like Apples Find My Friends), calendar event details and duration, time zone info and weather info.Meanwhile,close friendsmay be placed into the Trusted group, which lets them see a slightly lessdetailed status, including regional location (e.g. California), free/busy information (as determinedby your calendar), time zone and weather info.Of course, like many smart address books before it, Caret is only as goodas its network. That is, if your friends and family dont use the app, then you wont see their availability information.That said,if Carets user base is able to grow, there are other neat tricks it can do. For instance, you can configure a custom status that pops up with you arrive at a pre-set location and then see which contacts are near you. This could make sense for when youre arriving at a big event, like a conference, concert, or outdoor festival, perhaps.To encourage users to usethe app, Caret takes a page from competingmessaging apps and offer free VoIP calls that include the callers name, location, distance from you and time zone.The consumer-facing app itself is free, but the bigger vision for Caret is as a service platform. Through the Caret API, developers could integrateInternet of Things devices like smart thermostats, home security systems, fitness wearables,connected cars with Caret in order to do things like turn on the heat when youre nearing home, tell trusted contacts when youve hit the road, inform friends not to call because youre sleeping, and so on.Anka says hefounded the company in 2010, but didnt put together a team around Palo Alto-based Caret until October 2013, after he retired from LogMeIn. Others on the team includeJozsef Patvarczki, CS PHD from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (Mass.) andEndre Tamas, MD. The startup is backed by $900,000 from Anka and others.Patvarczki was the one who actually came up with the concept, however, after realizing that every time he phoned someone he was always asking if now was a good time to chat.Caret is a free download on iTunes, Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. The company may generate revenue in the future by integrating with businesses, or allowing consumers to get business information through the app like opening hours or appointment availability, for example.The question now for mobile users is whether or not theyre comfortable sharing that level of personal information with anyapp ornetwork, no matter how configurable the privacy settings may be.
