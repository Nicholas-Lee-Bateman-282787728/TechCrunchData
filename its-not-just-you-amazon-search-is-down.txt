If youve been trying to search for something on Amazon.com for the past few hours, youve been receiving a service unavailable Error 500. Thats because Amazon is suffering an outage.While the homepage and the product pages are still working, you also get an error if you try to open a category. Clicking on Books for example gives you an error. The issue also affects the Amazon mobile apps.Todays downtime seems to be affecting Amazon.com only as search is working just fine on Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.fr, etc. Similarly, there isnt any outage on Amazon Web Services status page. AWS customers dont seem to be affected.Still, think about how much money Amazon is losing right now. Amazon processes so many orders per minute that even a few minutes of downtime is a big deal.Given that reports of Amazon being down started more than three hours ago, this is more serious than a brief outage.Update: As of 10 am EDT, search functionality seems to have been restored. Weve reached out to Amazon for comment or details on the outage and will update accordingly.
