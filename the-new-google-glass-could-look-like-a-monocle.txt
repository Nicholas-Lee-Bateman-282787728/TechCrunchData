Get ready for the Google Monocle. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted a new patent to Google for a potential upcoming version of Google Glass. The best way to put it is that it doesnt look like a pair of glasses anymore  its a glorious monocle that wraps around your head.Heres an abstract from the patent:The band is adjustable such that it can be configured by a user to contact the head of the user at a first location near a temple, a second location along a portion of the users ear adjacent the temple, and at a third location along a rear position of the head of the user.Once you configure it, Glass should retain its configuration. The question is whether this will be enough to revive interest for this device.As a reminder, Google halted sales of Glass back in January. The company later said that it needed to pause and reset development of the device.In March, we reported that Google was looking for new areas of opportunity for Glass. In particular, Google could sell Glass to enterprise customers.But the company has been mostly silent since then. Its unclear whether Google is still working on software and hardware improvements. But it looks like todays new patent proves that Google hasnt given up just yet.Via The Next Web
