In the latest episode of holy shit, how is this guy not in jailoh, he iscool, the FBI was forced to make a statement about todays arrest of Martin Shkreli for securities fraud.In case you dont know, Shkreli acquired an unreleased album by the popular rap group Wu-Tang Clan for $2M. There is only one copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin and Shkreli has it.Or was it seized during his arrest?The FBI says nope:#Breaking no seizure warrant at the arrest of Martin Shkreli today, which means we didn't seize the Wu-Tang Clan album. FBI New York (@NewYorkFBI) December 17, 2015This absolute genius of a person tried to cop the album in a very direct way, which might have caused the FBI to speak out:Just FOIA'd the FBI to try to get the Wu-Tang Clan album from Martin #Shkreli  Let's party! pic.twitter.com/Dd0nxU1DwH Andrew Wiseman (@wisemana) December 17, 2015What are our thoughts at TechCrunch?
