Klook, a service that helps touristsfind interesting activities to do whenthey traveloverseas in Asia, is in the money today, after closing a $1.5 million seed investment round.The financingis led byXiaoguang Wu, asenior executive vice president with Chinese internet giant Tencent  he is CEO of the companys e-commerce division. Alongside theround, Shuren Hu, formerlyVice-Chairman of Strategy and Planning at the China National TourismAdministration, joinedthe company as an advisor.Hong Kong-based Klookwas founded in September 2014 with the aim of providing English-speaking and Chinese travel enthusiasts with a platform to discover interesting activities  from diving in Bali, to Disneyland Tokyo, andrace track driving in Singapore  which it offersup with upwith discounts of up to 50 percent.Klook doesnt cover hotel or flight bookings because theres already a myriad of companies in that space, instead it covers how youspend your time in21 destinations across Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and Mauritius. Many of these countries are travel hotspots for Chinese tourists right now, which is no coincidence since Klook is looking to capitalize on the growth of Chinese tourism.For example, if you want to visit Bangkok  its a great place, trust me on that  then you can pull up the city on the Klook platform and get a range of activity ideas: from popular picks, to unique activities, and deals.Klook  which recentlyreleased dedicated mobile apps for iOS and Android  claims to have over1,000 carefully handpicked experiences. It uses a combination of deal selecting and local teams to bring together discounted tickets and more unique local experiences.Now that it has mobile apps, Klook said that its customers can browse activities and make bookings after they arrive at their departure. Klooks mobile app can handle mobile ticketing and entry to destinations, so theres no need to worry about paper tickets and queues.Mobile will be a game changer for this sector,Klook co-founderEric GnockFah said in a statement. Although, according torecent data, over 80 percent of travelers research their trip online pre-departure, webelieve a significant share of the bookings happen at the destination.Curated travel activities is not new, and it tends to be a tough niche to play in because so many big brands dominate the travel space. Its a large pie, though, since Asia-based tourists are tipped to become the worlds most prolific (and lucrative) travelers by 2030, with China estimated to become the worlds largest contributor.Wu, the Tencent executive who also sits on the board eLong  the Chinese travel firm Expedia recently divested from  believes Klook is well positionedto capture this huge market opportunity.Klook, which has a staff of 20, claimed it has clocked over 200,000 userssince its September 2014 launch.
