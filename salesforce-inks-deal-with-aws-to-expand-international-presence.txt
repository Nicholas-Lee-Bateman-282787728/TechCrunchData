AWS announced today that it was expanding its relationship with Salesforce.com,with Salesforce namingthe cloud giant a preferred cloud provider.The agreement should help Salesforce increaseits international presence without having to build itsown data centers incountries that have data sovereigntylaws, which require that datastays in-country. Its expensive to build their own, so they are turning to a public cloud infrastructure provider like Amazon to do the heavy lifting for them.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff spoke glowingly of AWS. There is no public cloud infrastructure provider that is more sophisticated or has more robust enterprise capabilities for supporting the needs of our growing global customer base, he said in a statement.Itsworth keeping in mind, however that Salesforce also has a deep relationship with Microsoft  and CEO Satya Nadella appeared on stage at Dreamforce, Salesforces massive customer conference last fall.But the relationship has a flip side and the companies also compete with one another. R Ray Wang, who is principal at Constellation Research, points out that this announcement should help Salesforce compete with Oracle and Microsoft overseas.It also helps Salesforce keep its options open so it doesnt rely too much on any single vendor, especially Microsoft, while buildingon itsexisting relationship with AWS.The experiences in the IOT cloud, Heroku, RelateIQ, have shown that the workloads Salesforce customers need can be reliably delivered by Amazon at an ever decreasing unit cost, Wang explained.Al Hilwa, an analyst with IDC who covers enterprise cloud, sayswe shouldnt read too much into this and it could be purely about negotiating a better price.What we are likely seeing here is some new negotiated terms and pricing between the two firms. A number of Salesforce apps can and will run on AWS, Hilwa told TechCrunch.AWS announced that the deal includesSales Cloud, Service Cloud, App Cloud, Community Cloud, Analytics Cloud and more.We are seeing increasing partneringamong the big enterprise companies as each tries to walk the line between competing and cooperating.Just last week SAP announced a deeper cloud deal with Microsoft. As Nadella has said, no platform can stand alone anymore because customers are demanding interoperability.This latest deal is just another case of Salesforce covering its bases and providing a cost-effective way to expand its markets overseas without getting so chummy with Microsoft that it becomes overly reliant on them.
