Sony today revealedthe Xperia Z4, its latest flagship smartphone. The devicewas made public in an announcement in Japanese, and, at this point, thereis neither aninternational launch date nor an accompanying Compact version.The Xperia Z4 is much like its Z3 predecessor, with the same 5.2-inch screen, athinner6.9mm form, and aSnapdragon 810 processor which clocks a more modest 2GHz but is eight-core and 64-bit. The rear-facing camera has the same eye-popping20.7-megapixels, the front-facing camera has gottenawide-angle lens. Theres3GB of RAM under the hood and Android 5.0 Lollipop runsout of the box.Sony is known for its water- and dust-resistant devices, and the Xperia Z4 also delivers on that front. (Thats of note for any Samsung customers frustrated that the new Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are not water-resistant.)Sony had been rumored to be considering an exit from the smartphone space, though its latest restructuring didnt see that eventuality realized it remains a possibility in the future. The Xperia Z4 is another iterative productand, while the Xperia Z3 received positive reviews, it didnt sell particularly well, which makes it hard to seehow sticking to the same recipe will dig the companyout of its rut on mobile.But, if youre an Xperia fan, stay tuned for details of the Z4s international launch, which will comesooner rather than later now that the cat is out of the bag in Japan.
