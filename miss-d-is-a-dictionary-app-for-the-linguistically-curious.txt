If youre seriously attempting tolearn another language then at least one dictionary app will be astaple onyoursmartphone home screen. And familiaritywith its UX foibles will have long ago set your teeth on edge.But when youre grappling with a hard problem like language learning, your personal tolerance for minor irritationsmust necessarily be very high indeed. Or you might as well say adiosto those dreams ofspeaking like a nativeright now.Sadly, theres no app to upload another idiomadirectly to your brain  ya esta! quite yet. Indeed, itappears all were going to get from tech in the near future is some spammy chatbots and the chance to strap an egg box to your face topretend youre somewhere else So nothing halfas useful, clearly. Ergo,were stuck with dictionary apps for now.My go-to dictionary apphas the unlovely name of SpanishDict. Its design is better than the awkwardname suggests, but aesthetics-wise the highest praise youdprobably bestow uponit is that it looks clean and functional. Which is fine. After all, its a workhorse, not a show pony  or at least it should be, assumingyoure really set oncommunicating afuerayour comfort zone.But some irritations doremain, mostly in the form of repetitive UX actions thatwould go entirely unnoticed if it was just an app that was usedoccasionally. But, well, if youre looking up stuff every couple of hours of every day,thenanyUX friction becomesmagnified via accumulation and soon stacks up to a sizable frustration.Such as, for example, the need to tap to positionthe cursor inside the text box before you can start typing whatever wordsyou need to translate.Or a fiddly/glitchy implementation ofcut and paste on the definitions screen (Id have thought the need to smoothly snatchtranslations and relay them to messaging apps like WhatsApp is a pretty standardmodus operandi for language learners nowadays, so dictionary app developers  hint, hint!  make cut and paste really, really easy!).Ergo,theres certainly room for improvement. Although, ultimately, Id always pick substance/utility over design/style for an app where sustainededucation is the primary goal.That said,a New Zealand-based app developerduo reckonsa stronger focus ondesign can injectnewenergy to shake upwhat it dubs the boring dictionary app space  even if only for rather less single-minded language learners than I.And the result? A visually minimalist, determinedly modern and rather charming dictionary app called Miss D, which co-founder Tony Tao says is aimed at making people curious about learning other languages. Lots of other languages, given the app simultaneously translates your target word (or phrase) into not one but 10 other languages: French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Italian, Portuguese, Korean and Polish.And thats not all; if youre just searching for a word, it canalso serve you up a relevant emoji. And a Wikipedia definition(in English) of the term you were looking for.But best of all, in my opinion, the app kills off the cursor, landing you right into text input mode with the visual command to type as soon as you open it. So no need to tap once to begin typing. A small detail, sure, but in the long game of language learning, its the little stuff that counts.Butwhat about the big stuff? The apps grand design decision to simultaneously translate into so many otherlanguages  who really needs an app that does that?It is all about curiosity, is Taos response. By using a typical one to one dictionary app, you may learn hello in Chinese, however you may never learn hello in Italian, Russian, Spanish or Korean. The ultimate goal is to extend your leaning circle, not onlygiving you what you want, but also what you need.I bet if you can say hello in 10+languages you will make more friends? Be more popular in the office? Everyone gives you Dr. Smart as a nick name, you name the possibility, he adds, suffixing his sentence with a smilie.He does also point out that the app can be used for focusing on justone language if you prefer (and if you can visually tune out the other results). To further this use-case, itretains the position where you scrolledwhen it displays its list of multiple definitions, and will then keepserving up your translations in the same position (assuming you dont close the app)  so with what is presumably your target language where you last left it.Our target audience should be people using apps like Google Translate, and we position our app as something between a comprehensive dictionary app and traditional translation app, he says, adding:The UX of the app is built around both user cases not just for people after multiple languages.The emoji feature also has a little more purposebehind it than first meets the eye. Emojis may seem trivial, but symbols are more universal than words, so, in the context of a dictionary app, emojiscan potentially be a useful additional toa language learners toolbox.It is the first time I see it in a dictionary app as far as I know, says Tao, dubbing the emoji feature fun and useful. The idea is to transform the words into graphics which we believe is very powerful. Lets say you are in China, and you want to say the word Bus; instead of saying the word in Chinese, you can just show the emoji and they will understand.You cant argue with that basic logic. Or with the communicativepower of emojis.The Miss D app is free to download, but theres a pro version  via a paid upgrade ($1.49)  that offers a few more features, such as the ability to listen to audio clips of translations (you just need to tap the word once to hear it twice).So again, for users of the freemium app, the emoji feature could act asa stand-in alternative tonot being able to play an audio clip if youre not confident of correctly pronouncing a word.Another cute piece of design means the background color of the appchangesbased on the sentiment of the words. So you might see a green background if you search for the word grass, for example. Or a blue background if you search for sky.Its a subtle visual detail that could perhapshelp when it comes toreinforcing the memorizing process for translated words.The idea for strippingback adictionary app interface to the bare-bones of search plus translationcame after the team talked to a handfulof dictionary app users about thefeatures they use, says Tao such as vocabulary lists, favorites and word of the day  and were apparently toldpeopleonlyuse one feature: search.Now call me crazy, but I also love my dictionary appsWord of the Day feature, and have developeda nearsuperstitious curiosity to viewwhich new new word will kick off mymorning. But there are a range of other features in SpanishDictthat I barely or dont really use. So a tight, thoughtful approach towhat to include/not to include, features-wise, probably always has a place in app design.That said, Tao says they will beadding a Word of the Day feature in a future update to the app, along with the ability to reorder the languages list so you can choose which language you see first, second and so on. They arealso looking at how to include verb conjugation (another workhorse feature I point out as useful to dictionary app users) in the future, and arethinking about smart ways to display multiple definitions for words where one word can havedifferent interpretations (at the moment the app just serves up a single option).So, in fact, theres quite a lot more on the roadmap of Miss D  which could result in a rather less minimalist app, down the line. Time will tell how well they balance thechallenge of slotting a whole lot more in.For now, its a cute app, for sure. And while its not going to usurpmy trusty workhorse SpanishDict anytime soon,nor is my finger hovering over Miss Dpreparing to push-delete the appinto oblivioneither  the inexorablefate of so many lesser creations so its earned itself a little breathing space on my home screen. Evidentlystrong design, thoughtfully applied, can developits own substance.
