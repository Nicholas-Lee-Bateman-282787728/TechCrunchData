Imagine youre Edward Snowden with a Facebook profile. You text an ace reporter at the Guardian and have a new bit of information to share: you totally found a great new coffee place in the heart of Moscow where the CIA cant poison you with thallium. How do you send that news securely over Facebook Messenger?Crypter is the answer. Created by a Max Mitchell, a student at Sussex University, the app enables encrypted chat over Facebook messenger. It is a plugin for Chrome and Firefox and works by encrypting the communications with an agreed-upon password and decrypting it on the fly in the browser.We had an if you cant beat them, join them attitude, in designing Crypter, said Mitchell. Instead of inviting users to join a brand new chat application we decided to apply it to an already established one  Facebook. And at the same time making sure that we dont interrupt with our users existing habits.The application basically sits silently in your conversations and works efficiently when you want to use it, he said.There are still a few bugs  an effort to initiate a super secret conversation didnt go as planned  but feel free to try it with me if youd like. A seamless chat, plugin-based encryption scheme is pretty compelling especially given the relatively insecure nature of Facebook. However, unless its really easy and seamless Id have a hard time trusting my secret tiramisu recipe to any service. Mitchell has created something that is nearly invisible and seems like it might be a good one-off solution to secure communications between friends, reporters, and secret dessert lovers.
