Authorities in New York have taken the first step to appealing a judges rulinglast month that denieda request for information held onan iPhone.Apple successfully appealed the order on the grounds that it relied on an expanded interpretation of the All Writs Act (AWA)  the same act, passed in its current form more than 100 years ago,that the FBI is leaning onto order Apple tounlock the San Bernardino iPhone. Unlike the latter case, Apple could unlock the New York iPhone since it is an older model an iPhone 5s  running itsdated iOS 7 software, thatdoesnt featurethe same security setup as iOS 8, which Apple itself isnt able to circumvent.In a new filing made Monday, reported by NBC, theJustice Department Monday urged a federal judge to look at the case again:In light of the debate that has recently come to surround this issue, it is worth briefly noting what this case is not about. Apple is not being asked to do anything it does not currently have the capability to do.Apple may perform the passcode-bypass in its own lab, using its own technicians, just as it always has, without revealing to the government how it did so. Therefore, granting the application will not affect the technological security of any Apple iPhone nor hand the government a master key.The DoJ also claimedthat Apples software continues to obstruct its work."Obstruction of justice" is a truly frightening argument for DOJ to make about software that was legal to create. pic.twitter.com/rO1puJEl2w Riana Pfefferkorn (@Riana_Crypto) March 8, 2016Apple, which has complied with similar requests in the past, reiteratedits concern with the misuses of the AWA in response to the new filing.Judge Orenstein ruled the FBIs request would thoroughly undermine fundamental principles of the Constitution and we agree. We share the Judges concern that misuse of the All Writs Act would start us down a slippery slope that threatens everyones safety and privacy, it said in a statement.Beyond warning ofthe precedent that software to access the San Bernardino iPhone would set if created,Apple CEO Tim Cook has publicly lamentedthe routethe FBI has taken withits request. In using the AWA, Cook argued, authorities have bypassed regularsystems and trampled on individual rights. Fora seminal case such as theSan Bernardino iPhone request, which could shape other investigations and cases in the future,the Apple chief believesany ruling on the matter should come from Congress where the people of America get a voice.While the New York case has different specifics to San Bernardino, Apples concern in both situations is that authorities are abusing the AWA, which sets a dangerous precedent for the future and may violate the fourth amendment safeguarding the right of the people to be secure.
