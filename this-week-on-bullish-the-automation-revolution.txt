Hello friends, and welcome back to another episode of Bullish, TechCrunchs first talk show.This time aroundwe dug into the idea of automation, working to understand where to draw the line between intelligent hardware and robots. That, and whether machine learning fused to learning systems is something that we should embrace or fear.To help us dig into the topic, we had Brady Forrest drop by the office. Forrest is deeply involved in the startup community working to build hardware for what is next. Its not a simple task. The old joke that hardware is hard persists for a reason.Opinion on the matter is somewhat divided  Elon Musk has rung the alarm, but other technology figures are less concerned.Irecently learned after kicking it with IBMs Watson crewthat the work to build software systems that can teach themselves is well underway. But that is only part of the picture. The world of hardware is far and away more than software. You have to build both.How long  or soon  until the average person has a number of devices in their home that help them do life? For the technology-savvy, the answer is sooner, I presume, than for the less tech-focused. At the same time, something cannot become ubiquitous without reaching the mass market, and that means Silicon Valley cant be more than a beachhead.Will our robot revolution be powered by small companies or large incumbents? Lets find out.Bullish airs every Wednesday morning at 7 am Pacific, and 10 am Eastern. Well see you all soon.
