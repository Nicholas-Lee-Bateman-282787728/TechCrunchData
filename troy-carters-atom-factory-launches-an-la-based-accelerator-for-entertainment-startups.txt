Troy Carter, talentmanager to the stars (and successful VC), has announced that his company is launching SMASHD LABS, a new startup accelerator.The program will be based out of Atom Factorys L.A. office, and invest $50,000 in five to seven startupsin exchange for a 3percent stake in the companies.Accepted startups will participate in a 10-week curriculum designed toteach founders thingslike how to get press, user acquisition strategies, and other skillsthat all early-stage companies need to succeed.Carter mentioned that most accelerators produce foundersthat still lack these important skills, which is why SMASHD LABS will make teaching thema main focus of the program.While SMASHD LABSwont have the brand recognition of programs like YC or 500 Startups (at least at first), Carters connections to celebritiesandinfluencers couldbe valuable to startupstargeting theentertainment industry.According to Carter, the inspiration forthe program came from working with Disneys Accelerator, of which Carter is a mentor. He alsohopes the initiative will allow him and his company to better mentor young entrepreneurs and startups, as well as invest in early-stage tech companies.Atom Factoryeventually hopes to turn the accelerator into an annual or semiannual program accepting a wide variety of companies. However, the first batch will befocused just on startups innovating in the entertainment industry.Specifically, Carter said he is interested in companies offering predictive analytics to the music management industry.For example, many artists have trouble identifying the perfect tour schedule that will maximize sold out shows. If a company could analyze listening habits and notice that certain artists are heavily played in certain locations, itcould sell data on an ideal concert scheduleto an artists manager.Applications are opennow onSMASHD LABSs website, and the program will start on September 14 in Los Angeles.
