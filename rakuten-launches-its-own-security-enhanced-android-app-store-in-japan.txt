Rakuten, Japans top online retail firm, has pulled an Amazon after it launched its own branded Android app store today.The company is promising that Rakuten App Ichiba will not only give customers a chance to gain loyal points from money spent on Androidapps, but furthermore itll offer stronger security measures than Googles own app store.Rakuten App Ichiba was initiallyscheduled to open at the end of June, but after a delay the doors opened today. Rakuten said it has an initial 380 apps from 180 developers, including some exclusives. Thats an awful lot less than the Google Play Store  which has over one million  sothe company willneedto make good on its promise to beef up that selection if it is to appeal to Android device owners. The online retail giant offers its Super Points loyalty scheme across a range of services  it has ventured into banking and phone plans, as well as more standard areas of e-commerce  and thats being extended to cover in-store and in-app payments within theapp store.Perhaps the most interesting part, however, is around security. Countless reports have found that Android accounts for the overwhelming bulk of malware on mobile  thats something Apple CEO Tim Cook has emphasized in the past  but Rakuten has teamed up with security firmTrend Micro to try to combat that threat.Trend Micros technology will assess all apps that are uploaded toRakuten App Ichiba, while the store will also offer a feature that runs a security scan of a users phone each month. We havent seen many companies create their own app stores for some time, but other examples include Amazon, andpopular internet portal Yahoo Japan. This is likely to be a Japan-only affair, since Rakutens business is strongest on its home turf.
