Do you run a Facebook Page? Heads up: your pages Like count is probably going to drop a bit soon, and its totally not your fault.The short version: Facebook is changing the way itscounting likes, subtracting any accounts that have been either manually deactivated or memorialized after its owner passed. Its something that probably should have been done since the beginning  but since it wasnt, itd be easy to think your Likes had dropped because of something youd done.One thing thats important to note: it seems that this only accounts for profiles that have been manually deactivated. Likes from profiles that could be considered inactive because the user just hasnt logged in for a while will continue to count.The shift wont happen immediately; Facebook says itll roll out in the coming weeks.So how many Likes might you lose? Its tough to say. While Facebook says to expect a slight dip, its all relative to how many Likes you have to begin with. If your page only has a few dozen likes, you might not even lose one; if it has a few million, that slight dip will feel a bit bigger.If you run your companys Facebook page and your boss gauges your performance based on whether that like counter keeps climbing, its probably a good idea to let them know whats coming.
