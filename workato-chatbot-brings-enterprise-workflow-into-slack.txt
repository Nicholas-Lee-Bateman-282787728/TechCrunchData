As we head into 2016, enterprise chat applications like Slack are suddenly a hot commodity, and if youre inside chat a good portion of the day the argument goes, you should be able to access other work without leavingthe chat client. This is exactly what Workatos newly announced chat bot, Workbot, is designed to do.Chat bots are small programs that integrate with a chat platform and provide some advanced type of functionality in a fairly easy fashion. The new Workbot-chat bot enables users to access and control over 100 enterpriseapplications such as a Salesforce CRM record, Quickbooks accounting information or Zendesk customer service interactions directly inside of Slack.Oneof the primary issues withearly Enterprise 2.0 tools was that they were just another application busy employees needed to pay attention to. The idea here is to give userscustomer information directly in the context of the discussion they may be having with a fellow employee in an integrated fashion (or to simply get the information from the bot without prompting).One of the things we saw in early collaboration tools like Yammer or SalesforceChatter was that after initial hype that we have a new tool and we dont have to do email, people eventually got resentful that these tools became one more feed you needed to pay attention to and take care of, Anshu Sharma, venture partner at Storm Ventures, one of Workatos investors explained.The idea behind Workatos Workbot is to let employees interact directly withenterprise applications that matter to them inside the chat client  and bring a level of automation to that. Its worth noting that it requires a certain language to get that information (much like you have to ask the Amazon Echo a question just the right way), but its also possible to create connections to enterprise apps with simple aliases like customer info to reduce the amount of typing.Workbot inside Slack.

First of all, it can provide users with a full view of the customer inside of Slack, pulling the information from various customer information sources, but its not just a pure integration tool. It also provides alevel of intelligence to the data by filtering more important informationsuch asticket priority, customer location or past due invoices. Finally, customers can define triggers so that if a certain threshold is met such as x number of outstanding support tickets, the customer service manager would get a message from Workbot inside of Slack automatically.Workato isa company concentrating on simplifying enterprise integration. Instead of using expensive or complex enterprise workflow or integration tools, Workatos goal has beento simplify the process so that non-technical end users could create integrations on their own, putting togetherrecipes that created workflows, like IFFT has done on the consumer level.This isnt the first time companies have tried tointegrate enterprise applications inside a messaging tool. We have seen it extensively in email with many companies trying to integrate inside of Microsoft Outlook.Whats more, in the early part of this century there was a short-lived attempt to make enterprise instant messaging clientsthe center of our work lives, a vision that didnt quite come to fruition.Its also worth noting that Facebook is trying something similar for consumers inside Messenger.Workato also announced a private beta of Workbot for HipChat.
