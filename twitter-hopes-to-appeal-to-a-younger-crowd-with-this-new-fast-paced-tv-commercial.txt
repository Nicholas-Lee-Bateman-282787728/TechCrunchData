During Twitters Q3 earnings call, CEO Jack Dorsey let us know that the company would be running a new TV commercial during the World Series.As The Verge points out, this commercial was done by the same group that did Apples 1984 campaign. While its not the first commercial by Twitter, it does look like the beginnings of an actual campaign. Twitters looking to go after the younger crowd, The Verge also notes.While this fast-paced, meme-filled look at Twitter Momentsis interesting to watch for the general public, it might fail to grip for someone whos on the fence or leaning towardconsuming their tweets on CNN or ESPN. As Ive pointed out with Moments, the key is slowing down the service in a consumable way for folks who arent hardcore realtime users  young or not. The product itself does that pretty well, letting you catch up on stories of all types at your own pace.The commercial doesnt necessarily reflect that, as everything zooms by on the screen, even though it all ends up being reflected in the calmer Moments setting.Youll agree, Im suresame firm or not, this campaign is certainly no 1984.Will people who forgot all about Twitters actual product and havent seen it in quite a while take a second look after seeing this? They might. If theyre into sports, which they probably are if theyre catching the World Series, theres an even better chance theyll give it another shot. I get it. Kids like flashy fast things, but actual comprehension is universal.If the commercial doesnt work, this really wont (lets hope that this is just a cruel Microsoft-Clippy-shoutout-to-Ballmer themed joke):Now that you've seen our television commercial, check out Zappy, our @twittermoments mascot. pic.twitter.com/VwycmG6fOW Andrew Fitzgerald (@magicandrew) October 28, 2015
