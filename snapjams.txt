Hes an avid listener of indie rock, bubblegum pop, and dreamy electronica whos even floated the idea of Snapchat running a record label. In the meantime, he frequently tweets out screenshots of what hes listening to on his iPhone, or links to songs on SoundCloud and Hype Machine.So while we wait for Snapchats big moves in music, we can at least get inside Spiegels ears. Above is a playlist of every song hes ever tweeted (barringobscure remixes and Beatles tracks that arent on Spotify), plus six songs featured in Snapchats commercials.And as a bonus, heres the video for my favorite Snapjam, Goldrooms Embrace:
