A group of Internet scholars and legal academics hascalled on Google to be more transparent about its decision-making process inregards to its implementation of Europesso-called Right to be forgotten ruling.Its one year since Europes top court handed down alegal ruling that requiressearch engines to process private individuals requests for the delisting inaccurate, outdated or irrelevant data returned by a search result for their name.In that time, Google has processed around 250,000 individual requests, granting delisting to individual requesters in around 40 per cent of cases.In making these delisting decisions, Google and other search engines are required to weigh up any public interest in knowing the information. Its more transparency about how Google is makingthosevalue judgements that the group isessentially calling for.They are focusing on Google specifically becauseit is by far the dominant search engine in Europe (with a circa 90 per cent share of the market), arguing that the information that Google has released thusfar has been anecdotal  anddoes not allow outsiders to judge how representative it is.Writing in an open letter to Googlethe 80signatories, who are affiliated withmore than 50 universities and institutions around the world, argue that more data is needed to assesshow Google is implementing the ruling, and to work towards striking the sought for balance between pro-speech and pro-privacy positions.They write:Beyond anecdote, we know very little about what kind and quantity of information is being delisted fromsearch results, what sources are being delisted and on what scale, what kinds of requests fail and in whatproportion, and what are Googles guidelines in striking the balance between individual privacy andfreedom of expression interests.The group summarizes its aims as follows:Not all signatories of the letter support the rtbf ruling itself, but they are united in their call that Google should stumpupmore data, writing:We all believe that implementation of the ruling should be much more transparent for at least tworeasons: (1) the public should be able to find out how digital platforms exercise their tremendous powerover readily accessible information; and (2) implementation of the ruling will affect the future of the RTBFin Europe and elsewhere, and will more generally inform global efforts to accommodate privacy rightswith other interests in data flows.The group adds:Peter Fleischer, Google Global Privacy Counsel, reportedly told the 5th European Data Protection Days onMay 4 that, Over time, we are building a rich program of jurisprudence on the [RTBF] decision. (Bhatti,Bloomberg, May 6). It is a jurisprudence built in the dark. For example, Mr. Fleischer is quoted as sayingthat the RTBF is about true and legal content online, not defamation. This is an interpretation of thescope and meaning of the ruling that deserves much greater elaboration, substantiation, and discussion.Signatories ofthe letter includeIan Brown,Professor of Information Security and Privacy at theUniversity of Oxford, Oxford Internet Institute;Lilian Edwards,Professor of Internet Law at theUniversity of Strathclyde;David Erdos,University Lecturer in Law and the Open Society at theUniversity of Cambridge, Faculty of Law; andJohn Naughton,Professor, Wolfson College at theUniversity of Cambridge.Another signatory, Peggy Valcke,Professor of Law, Head of Research at KU Leuven  iMinds, is notable as also being a member of Googles self-styled advisory council. Aka the group of academics Google established last year,in response to the rtbf ruling, and which subsequently compiled a reportwith recommendations for how Mountain Viewshould implement the ruling. Although Google recruited outside experts for that group, the entire process was Google-led  and widely viewedas a sophisticated lobbying effort by the company to apply pressure to a legal rulingit is idealistically and commercially opposed to.The academics letter details 13 data points (listed below in full) which the signatoriesbelieve Google should be disclosing  at a minimum  in order to help shape theimplementation of the rtbf ruling, and assist in developing reasonable solutions, as they put it.Critics of the rtbfhave often decried how it requiresprivate companies to makepublic interest value judgements. The academics call to shine more light onto Googles processes is one answer to this criticism. It also emphasizes the fact that, as it stands, no one except Google is party to enough data to assess and quantify Googlesimplementation of the law. Which of course is a farcical situation.The ruling effectively enlisted Google into partnership with European states in striking a balance betweenindividual privacy and public discourse interests. The public deserves to know how the governingjurisprudence is developing, the academicsadd.The 13 data points they are calling for Google to release are as follows:The data that Google does release about rtbf request processing can be found on its Transparency Report which excludes a handful (22 in all currently) ofself-selected examples, such as this onefrom Belgium:Weve reached out to Google for comment on the letter and to ask whether it plans to release thespecific data-points requested by the group, andwill update this post with any response.Update:A Google spokesperson provided the following statement to TechCrunch:We launched a section of our Transparency Report on these removals within 6 months of the ruling because it was important to help the public understand the impact of the ruling. Our Transparency Report is always evolving and its helpful to have feedback like this so we know what information the public would find useful. We will consider these ideas, weighing them against the various constraints within which we have to work  operationally and from a data protection standpoint.
