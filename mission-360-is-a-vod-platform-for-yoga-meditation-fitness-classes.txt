We all want to be in better shape, but the commitment of going to a gym or a yoga class can be costly and time-consuming. Mission 360 is looking to eliminate all of the friction involved with working out, letting users do itfrom their homes through on-demand video classes.The model is similar to Classpass, in that users get unlimited access to Mission 360s entire store of videos for a flat monthly fee of $35.These video classes include fitness courses, meditation, yoga and pilates.Beyond the pre-recorded video classes, users can also set up individual one-on-one virtual courses with trained coaches and professionals for anywhere between $30 and $250, depending on the experience of your coach and the length of your session.These a la carte sessions cover a broad range of practices, such as nutritionists, life coaches, crystal healers, meditation experts, career coaches, sex/relationship therapists, and more.You can learn more about Mission 360 here.
