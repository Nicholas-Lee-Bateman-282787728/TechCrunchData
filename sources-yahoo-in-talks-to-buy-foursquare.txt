Yahoo has been busy rebuilding its business around mobileunder CEO Marissa Mayer, and soon it could makeone of its biggest bets yet on the platform. We have heard perennially thatthe company has been looking to buy Foursquare, the New York startup behind the eponymous local search app and location-based social check-in app Swarm.The latest rumor we are hearing is giving the deal a price tag of around $900 million.One sourcesaysthat the deal is donebut details are still being ironed out. Othershave also confirmed a Yahoo/Foursquare deal is in the frame.Yetother sourcesat Yahoo tell us they have heard nothing  nada  about the deal.Either this is elaborate, bicoastal speculation,or it is happening with only a selectcircle privy to what is going on. Re/code reportsthat its sources say there are no talks.Contacted for a response, both a Yahoo spokesperson and Foursquare co-founder and CEO Dennis Crowleydeclined to comment on rumor or speculation.You may haveheard this song before.As we said, this isnot the first time Foursquares name has been floatedas a potential Yahoo acquisition. On the part of Mayer, too, it could bea long time coming.When Re/code predecessor AllThingsD broke the news of Yahoo buying Tumblr, it mentioned that Mayer closely watched progress at both startupswhen she was still at Google.In that sense,its the rumor that refusesto die.The chatter we are hearing could mean that Foursquare is also in play with other suitors, but sinceour sources pointed directly to Yahoo, heres a rundown of how this could make sense:Foursquare has to date raised just over $162 million in funding, with its last round, in February 2014 from Microsoft, valuing the company at over $600 million. That Microsoft deal also included a licensing agreement to power location context for Windows and mobile searches.But Foursquarehas also been at a crossroads. Since splitting its app into two last year, the Foursquare app has hovered in the top 25 of travel apps (bydownloads) in the U.S. App Store according to App Annie. Swarm, meanwhile, has been on a gradual decline and is now around 146 in social networking. We at TechCrunchhavehad somany anonymous tips alleging possible sales of Foursquare to TechGiant.com that we have lost count. We are reporting this one in particular because a number of sources confirmwhat weve heard.Yahoo, meanwhile, has been facing its own challenges. While it is flush with cash from its stake in Chinas Alibaba, thecompany has been reorganizing its leadership, and has faced criticism forits product strategy being too focused on incremental iterations, despite the rushof acquisitions during Mayers tenure.We also understand Yahoohas been trying toreinvent its search business with technology likedeep linking on mobile, where mobile and web apps can essentially search and link to specific datain otherwise-siloed mobileapps.Yahoosname has also been mentioned as a possible contender to take overGoogles position as the default search app for Apples Safari browser, following on from Yahoo nabbing the same deal with Mozilla for Firefox in the U.S.Yahoo is also at a critical point in its search business in another regard: it hasbeen in a 10-year search pact with Microsoft, where Microsoft controls the technology behind Yahoo search. That deal passed a five-year break point onFebruary 23of this year and the two, most recently, haveextended negotiationsby 60 days (i.e., the end of next week).On top of this,last year Yahooannounced a deal with Yelp, one of Foursquares big competitors, to power listings reviews in its search results both on desktop and mobile.Some speculated that this spelled the end of any possible data or other deals between Yahoo and Foursquare  although that may not be the case. It so happens that Yelp also powers local search reviews on Bing, owned by Foursquare licensee Microsoft.So while there could be a scenario where all four companies  Microsoft, Yahoo, Yelp and Foursquare  actually worked together, if there is a break up, a Yahoo acquisition of Foursquaremightbeone way forYahoo tobring a trove of local search and locationdata,and the technology to power them, in-house, along witha team to work on it. Or even with a new MSFT deal, having Foursquarecould help differentiate Yahoo betterfrom the other search engine.In any case, an acquisition like Foursquarewould be a bold move for a company that years ago developed a reputation for outsourcing as a core competency.Foursquare could be a strong addition to Yahoo for other reasons, too.In addition to bolsteringYahoos own efforts in rebuilding its search product, it would boost Yahoos overall mobile portfolio of apps and its own primary-source data inlocal listings.Foursquares location database is also considered the cream of the crop. Other options like Facebook pale in comparison ofaccuracy and detail. Their location intelligence systemsare also very advanced, and something that Crowley considers one of Foursquares quiet strengths.Foursquare is, in essence, a context company  not just a location company.That extends also to the data Foursquarehas already amassed over the last six years. The companysays that to date there have been 7 billion check-ins, 70 million tips, 55 million people, 65 million places and 90 million tastes logged through its apps.Together, that data and technology havehelped the company build up its own commercial prospects. Just thisweek the company launched its newest solution,Pinpoint, a location-based advertising network that can target users by device, location and other parameters. Foursquare says Pinpoint is already being used by AT&T, Samsung, FedEx, Land Rover and others.Its also snagged other interesting strategic relationships, such as its partnership to power location tagging for TweetsonTwitter, and thatMicrosoft licensing deal.The fact that Foursquares location API is also in use by 85,000 developers of other apps would give Yahoo a major touchpoint with developers and publishers. That could complementits Flurry app analytics business and serve as a route toselling other products as well asintegrating their other services.Foursquare and Swarm would provideYahoo one more boost in social alongside its Tumblr acquisition. In other words, it would havemore critical mass inan area that has become fertile ground for brands looking for ways of connecting with users beyond static banners and more legacy media.*Updated with additional comment
