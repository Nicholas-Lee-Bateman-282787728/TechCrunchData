Can two wearables be better than one? Carnegie Mellon Universitys Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII)will bepresenting some newresearch next week in which they demonstrateatechnique aimed atextending the available screen spacefor smartwatch wearers by adding an additional wearable into the mix: a ring.Their smartwatch-ring wearable combo offers what they describe asa novel sensing approach  leveraging the conductivity of human skin in order totrack 2D finger touch co-ordinates in real-time and turn the area of the body directly around the smartwatchinto an interactive, touch-trackingsurface.The idea beingthat wearables like smartwatches can feel cramped and fiddly to interact with, given how small their screens need to be to fit on the average human wrist.The ring plus smartwatch approachwould allow awatch wearer to, for example, run a finger down the back of their hand and then swipe right to scroll through an on-screen list and select an item. Or trace a letter on the back of their hand to shortcut to a particular appor silence an incoming call.Offloading some of the necessary on-screen taps and swipes onto the surrounding skinalso frees the screen from being blocked by fingers  potentially making for a superior smartwatch app experience, such as for games (the researchers use the example of playing Angry Birds in the above demo video).They say their technique works through clothes, and is unaffected by different lighting conditions. In terms of accuracy results from the study apparently demonstrated high reliability and accuracy with a meandistance error of 7.6mm.Gestures canalsobe transmittedcontactlessly via the technique, with afinger hovering up to an inchabove the surface of the skin, thanks to a partial transmission of an electrical signal owing tothe human arm actinglike an antenna, says CMUs Chris Harrison, one of the scientistsinvolved in the research.The two components powering CMUs prototypewearableare a battery-powered ring that continuously emits an80MHz, 1.2Vpp AC signal into the finger on which it is worn; and a smartwatch wristband instrumented with a structured electrode pattern.When the users finger touches theskin, the electrical signal propagates into the arm tissue andradiates outwards The signal takes time to propagate, which means electrodeslocated at different places around the wrist will observecharacteristic phase shifts. By measuring these phasedifferences across several electrode pairs, SkinTrack cancompute the location of the signal source (i.e., the finger),enabling real-time touch tracking on the skin, they explain.A prior project from HCII, back in 2014, also focused on trying to extend the surface area of a smartwatch  in that instance byusing proximity sensors and projectors to display colored light buttons on the skin around the watch which could be interacted with without needing to touch the device itself.The latestprototype is arguably a less cumbersome approach to trying to extend the interactive surface area for smartwatch wearers, with the researchers noting that it requires no direct instrumentation of the touch area (i.e., a skin overlay). Althoughit does of course require the wearer to also charge, wear and not losea ring.And while weve seen a few attempts to fire up a market for supplementarysmart rings in recent times, either as smart jewelry for notifications or as remote controls for other devices, its fair to say that mass consumer adoption has not yet taken place. Problem is chunky rings are, well, a matter of taste. And easily dislodged/misplaced.Still, the CMU researchers reckon they are onto something by combining rings and smartwatches. As our approach is compact, non-invasive, low-cost and low-powered, we envision the technology being integrated into future smartwatches, supporting rich touch interactions beyond the confines of the small touchscreen, theywrite.Harrison reckonscommercialization of the technology could be possible within two to three years  assuming a smartwatch maker decides consumers can be convinced to buy into the benefit ofa dual wearable. (They would also, presumably, need tofire updevelopers to codeadditional gesture controls to their smartwatch apps to take advantage of a more expansive skinterface.)We need to improve the stability and accuracy but its the first of it kind, so we are really excited by the potential, Harrisontells TechCrunch.Headdsthere areno trade-offs with this technique, in size terms, when it comes tothe smartwatch wristband. It could be made very small, such that it fits into existing smartwatch form factors, he says.The biggest downside of the approach remainsthe need to wear (and not lose) an additional wearable (the ring). So how small could this be? The current CMU prototype is clearly pretty cumbersome. But Harrisonsays the team believes it can shrink this in size by incorporating an accelerometer tomaximize battery life.Our rings current battery is small, but still a bit awkward. We used this bigger battery to simplify our prototyping  it lasts 15 hours on a single charge when continuously transmitting.However, we are planning for some simple tricks that could dramatically extend that, he says.For example, it is easy to increate a small accelerometer that can detect when the finger has touched something, and we can turn on the signal emission only then. That would easily bring battery life to several days or even a week, or allow us to use a much smaller battery.The CMU research will be presented next Tuesday,at the ACM SIGCHI Conference in San Jose.
