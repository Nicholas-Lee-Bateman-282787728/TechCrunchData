The year has not been kind to Yelp shareholders.On the year, Yelps shares have tanked around 50 percent.Today wasnt an exception, with the company down more than 9 percent.Todays big swing comes on the heels of a new way of finding top-rated local businesses through Facebook cropped up on the Internet.The year has been a rocky one, with plenty of ups and downs  largely in line with the companys earnings reports, where it has recorded mixed results. Sometimes it beats, sometimes it misses, but each time the stock has swung in dramatic fashion. But the net-net has always been a slow, steady drive down.The company  while it has mad SEO game  has started to face increasing competition from other potential avenues for recommendations. And, of course, search on mobile devices is gradually losing its way as more and more people find content on the web through mobile apps, rather than search on mobile devices.And now it has another 500-pound gorilla in the room to potentially deal with Facebook  one that has a market cap that is orders of magnitude greater and with more resources the local recommendation engine could ever hope to have.
