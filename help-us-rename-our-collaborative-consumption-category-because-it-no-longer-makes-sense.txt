Halp!For years, TechCrunch has had a Collaborative Consumption category, which included companies like Airbnb, Uber, etc. But as time passes, and more and more on-demand companies move from 1099 to W2, the term collaborative consumption begins to make less and less sense. Internally, we floated the idea of changing the name of that category to On-Demand, but some of us felt that on-demand is too fuzzy a term, given that many companies categorize themselves as on-demand even when their product or service isnt deliverable on the spot. So, out of laziness or deference or some combination of the two, were turning to our faithful readers. What do you think we should call companies like Airbnb, Uber, Postmates, Handy, etc.? On-Demand? CoCo? Sharing Is Caring? Use your imagination and let us know in the comments.
