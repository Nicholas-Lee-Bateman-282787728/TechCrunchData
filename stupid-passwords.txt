The recent hack of fembot datingextramarital affairs website Ashley Madison, which resulted indata from millions of accounts being dumpedonline, hasone more salutary yet familiar lessonto deliver: even very well encrypted stupid passwords are still stupid.While plenty ofaspects ofAshley Madisons business and operations have raised eyebrows, the firm did apparently userobust and respectedencryption for its user passwords.But evenbcrypt-hashed passwords can be cracked if the user choses a stupid password, like, er, password. Or 123456.Yep, you can see where this is goingSure enough, after about two weeks runningpassword cracking utility, hashcat, on the first million passwords from the Ashley Madisondatabase of ~36 millionbcrypt-hashed passwords, security firm Avast has beenable to crack25,393 unique hashes  out of which it says therewere 1,064 unique passwords.To be clear: thats unique passwords as in different fromthe other cracked passwords its been able to crack so far, rather than what an amazing password! thats so super complex its probably uncrackable!.The firmhasbeen using two known-password lists for thecrack: The Top 500 Worst Passwords of All Time(which dates from 2008); and the 14 million password list that spilled out of the 2009 RockYou hack.Out of the data its been able to crack so far it says the top 20 ranked Ashley Madison passwords are as followsNo surprises there then.Except perhapswhy so manyNicoles?Remember the above password listisonly derived from a sub-set ofthosefirst million Ashley Madison passwords, whichmay be more likely to have been created earlier in the sites history  itlaunched circa 2001 so the first million could reflect somepretty vintage password thinking. Or not.Arguably the last one million passwords compared with the first million might be a more interesting test of the data  to see if humans have got any better at creating passwords over the past ~15 years.Albeit Avast stressesit is supposingthatthe password database was sorted chronologically, socannot 100% confirm either way.One thing remainsperennially clear: humans first impulse is to create a password theyre sure theyllremember, so stupidpasswords are basically a timeless expression of the storagelimitations of the human brain. Fixing that requires A) some other technology and B) whatever it is has to be implemented in such a way that using it is less effort than recalling andtyping 123456.
