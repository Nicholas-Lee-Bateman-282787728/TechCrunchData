Uber is again increasing its focus on passenger safety after it announced a partnership with mobile safety and auditing service Safetipin, starting in New Delhi, India.New Delhi is, of course, the city where a passenger was alleged raped by an Uber driver in December. In the aftermath of that incident, the U.S. companyhas (finally)introduced stricter background checks for drivers, and added an in-app panic button and location/journey sharing features  this coming-togetheris another effort to improve safety in the Indian city, the company said.Safetipins mobile app is essentially a guide to the safety of citiesand locations across the world.It includes a safety score for towns and cities created by the servicesnine-point audit  which covers the lighting, openness, visibility, security, walk path, crowd and gender diversity and density of each location. Thatssupplemented by data from users, who can uploadphotos and details of flashpoints and incidents at places they visit.Uber said it willadvance the contribution to Safetipins data collection efforts by allocating partner drivers within its fleet who will effectively beSafetipin data gathersfor a five-month test period that begins February 25.More precisely, selected drivers  who will be specifically trained  will use exterior-mounted camera phones to snap night-time photos from a range of locations at regular intervals  the photos will then betagged and analyzed using Safetipins nine-pointsystem.As well as helping to cover new areas, Uber said the collaborationwill enable the companies tore-assess locations to measure potential improvements. Thecity government and planners are also onboard with these efforts, Uber said.The partnership is starting in India, but Uber plans to tap into its global networkto extend it to other parts of the world.The initiative will be rolled out across other global markets in the coming months, including Bogot, Colombia and Nairobi, Kenya with the aim to cover approximately 20,000 km of city roads and areas, the company said in an announcement.It is easy to be cynical and call this partnership a marketing ploy post-New Delhi rape. In fact, Ubers failure to adequately cover safety issues before that incident practically invites that approach. But it is an interesting thought that Ubers global logistics network could be used to help non-profits or good causes across the world in the future.That global footprint has always been viewed as an opportunity toexpand Ubers breadth of services, and thats doubtless still true, but the company couldalso use its international reach to do good. Well see if thats part of the new Ubers strategy, and just how sincere that it is, over time.
