Astrobotic Technology, the company that plans to deliver payloads to the moon, hascompleted a $2.5 million seed round led by Space Angels Network.The company was originally spun out of Carnegie Mellon University in 2007 to compete for the Google Lunar XPRIZE (GLXP). As of today, theyve secured 10 deals from governments, companies, universities, nonprofits and individuals for their first mission to the moon.Like many of the other 16 companies left in the GLXP, Astrobotic is hoping to win the $20 million Grand Prize by becoming the first privately funded rover to land on the moon, travel 500 meters, and transmit high-definition video and images back to Earth.Illustration of Astrobotics Griffin Lander / Image courtesy of AstroboticBut unlike the other GLXP competitors, Astrobotic is unique in that theyve created a rideshare platform for other space agencies or companies to send their payloads to the moon. Interestingly enough, two other GLXP competitors have partnered with Astrobotic to land their rovers on the lunar surface.We offer space agencies all over the world unprecedented, affordable access to the Moon to achieve their science, exploration and resource goals. John Thornton, CEO of Astrobotic TechnologyChiles AngelicvM and Japans HAKUTO are two GLXP companies that have partnered with Astrobotic to land onthe lunar surface. HAKUTO, Japans sole entrant into the competition, will attach two rovers, known as Moonraker and Tetris, to Astrobotics lander. Similarly, Astrobotic will carry AngelicvMs Uni (for unity) rover.Partnering with Astrobotic allows these companies to focus on roving, imaging and communication technology and leave the difficult entry, descent and landing up to Astrobotic.We envision a NASCAR on the Moon scenario, where competing teams land together, and countries can cheer on their team to the finish line. John Thornton, CEO of Astrobotic TechnologyIn terms of technology development, Astrobotic has proven themselves as a worthy GLXP competitor.In fact, Astrobotic is the only GLXP team that has won three out of three GLXP milestone prizes, totaling $1.75 million.Because of this,a NASCAR-esque race on the moon between companies from the U.S., Japan and Chile to win the $20 million Grand Prize certainly isnt out of the question.Florida-based Moon Express (which has raised more than $30 million) and Germanys Part-Time Scientists each won two GLXP milestone awards.Cremated human remains, personal mementos, messages from children around the world and a time capsule are some of the other contracted Astrobotic payloads. When asked if these more sentimental payloads were part of the core business, John Thornton, CEO of Astrobotic told TechCrunch that while this is a smaller part of our long-term business, it remains important for us to enable that human connection.Ultimately, Astrobotic seems happy to work with any space agency or commercial company who is willing to pay the $1.2 million per kilogram price tag.Any payload thats brought to the moon by Astrobotic will have to stay there for now. Thornton said that they dont intend to bring anything back to Earth on their first two lunar missions, but eventually they could do a scientific sample return once they increase their payload capacity.Our first missions to the Moon will become historic landing sites that will remain untouched for future settlers to visit. The hardware from later missions will likely bere-purposed or recycled for future lunar settlements. For example, fuel tanks can be used to store fluids, solar panels can be reused, and metals can be ground up into powder for 3D printing new parts. John Thornton, CEO of Astrobotic TechnologyWith the additional funding, Astrobotic plans to accelerate the development of their Griffin lander, which they are co-developing with NASA. Since 2007, Astrobotic has received21 contracts from NASA, totaling several million dollars.Astrobotics Griffin Lander / Image courtesy of AstroboticAstrobotic isone of the three companies NASA has partnered with through the Lunar Cargo Transportation and Landing by Soft Touchdown (CATALYST) program to advance robotic lunar landing capabilities.One of the next big steps for Astrobotic will be to secure a verified launch contract.TwoGLXP teams  Moon Express and Israeli company SpaceIL  have already secured verified launch contracts with RocketLab and SpaceX, respectively. Both companies plan to launch in 2017.Thornton stated that they will reserve a launch contract of their own oncetheir manifest is full enough to fly. He expects that they will launch in the next couple ofyears.Regardless of who wins the GLXP Grand Prize, however, the lunar showwill go on. Like other GLXP frontrunners, Astrobotic plans to continue business as usual after GLXP is said and done.The GLXP has been a great catalyst to get started and now we have a series of 5 lunar missions planned. Regardless of the outcome of the prize, Astrobotic will be flying missions for decades to come John Thornton, CEO of Astrobotic Technology
