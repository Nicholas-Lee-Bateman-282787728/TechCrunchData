Xiaomi is broadening its horizons in India with the news that its Mi devices will be available throughtwo of the countrys majore-commerce sites, andoffline retailers there for the first time.The Chinese company initially entered India via an exclusive retail partnershipwith Flipkart, but, after selling one million devices in its first five months, it is broadening its distribution to reach more consumers and driveincreased sales.First up, customers will be able to buy devices from The Mobile Stores 800 outlets acrossIndia, as wellas stores from operatorAirtel  thats according toManu Jain, the head of Xiaomi India.2) This means u can now purchase your favourite Mi products from @Flipkart, @Snapdeal, @amazonIN, @themobilestores, and @airtelindia stores Manu Kumar Jain (@manukumarjain) April 7, 2015Secondly,Hugo Barra, the companys head of international, confirmed that Xiaomiproducts will becomeavailable via Amazon India and Snapdeal the other two of Indias big three online retailers.#MiFanFest: From tomorrow, Mi India fans can buy Mi products online across @Flipkart, @Snapdeal and @amazonIN ! Hugo Barra (@hbarra) April 7, 2015Finally, Xiaomi will stop requiring users to pre-register for its flash sales. The system, while frustrating for users, is designed to ensure Xiaomi only sells stock that it actually has.The fact that it is being lifted coupled with these new retail partners  suggests the company has a far larger allocationof phones. Good news for frustrated, would-be Mi phone ownersinIndia.This new broader focus stands in stark contrastto China, where Xiaomi controls its own online sales pipeline, but it makes sensein India, where its brand is less mainstream. Indias smartphone market is growing faster than anywhere in Asia, so now is the time to make a more sustained push.Beyond more avenues to consumes,Xiaomihas majorplans for India. In the near term that included theopening its Mi.com storein India, but, as Barra explained to TechCrunch in January, the longer vision is to eventually manufacture devices in India, not to mentiontweak itssoftware (and potentially hardware) to thespecific needsof Indian customers.In addition, itis open to acquisition and investment deals in the country, Barra said.That localization plan is a blueprint that the company hopes to pursue in other major international markets, including Brazil, Barras home country and a planned expansion, where local regulations require devices to be manufactured domestically.The ethos driving thisglobal expansion is the value oflocalizingthe business in each market. With a population of more than one billion and a culture that is sensitive to price, India in particular represents a vast business opportunitywhich could be advanced if Xiaomi can position itself as a local player, rather than a Chinese company that is merely in India.It isnt the only mid-range smartphone company looking at India, however. Fellow China-based rival OnePlus has made a big push in the country, while Indian competitorMicromax has ambitiousplans, which include an exclusive integration with Cyanogen, the company behind a popular modified version of Android.Xiaomi was founded five years ago, but already it has found incrediblesuccess in China. It is thetop smartphonecompany there, as of the most recent quarter of business,thanks toits appeal among fashion conscious, young consumers who cant pay up forthe latest Samsung or Apple device but wantan affordable phone that they can be proud of and showoff in public. Thats a recipe which Xiaomibelieves can be adapted to India, Southeast Asia and other emerging markets.Its too early to be sure, but the vast population of its current overseas geographies  which include India and Indonesia  coupledwiththe markets that Xiaomi plans to expand to  such asTurkey, Russia, Brazil, Thailand and Mexico  mean that, over time, its overseas business could match the 61 million units that it shipped (predominantly in China) in 2014. But, for now, India is theinternational market showing the most promise.
