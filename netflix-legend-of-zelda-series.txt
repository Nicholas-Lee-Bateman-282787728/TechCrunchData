Netflix is said to be working on a new series that uses Nintendos beloved Legend of Zelda games as their source material. The Wall Street Journal reports that its in the early stages of development, and that it will follow the basic premise of familiar hero Link being tasked with rescuing Zelda in the kingdom of Hyrule. This could be the greatest thing ever, or the worst thing ever.WSJs source says its essentially Game of Thrones, but with much more family-friendly content. That means probably nixing the nudes, as well as the ultraviolence. It will probably retain the fantasy elements, including magic, bows and arrows, and possibly even a dragon or two.Presented for your enjoyment, the first episode of the animated Legend of Zelda series, which was part of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! from the late eighties and early nineties. The animated show was actually one of the better parts of the series, according to my memory of it which is pretty certainly warped by nostalgia.Netflixs remake is live-action, which means it should be a very different beast. Nintendo doesnt have the best track record when it comes to live-action versions of its beloved IP  the Super Mario Bros. movie with John Leguizamo and Bob Hoskins is still among the most bizarre and unpleasant cinematic experiences of all time.I have faith in Netflix  they can make good things. They can also make Hemlock Grove, though. It is dangerous to go alone Nintendo, so please take this advice to heart: Dont destroy our collective childhoods.
