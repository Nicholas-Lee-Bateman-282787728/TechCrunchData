Googles fun little project called Paint The Town for itsself-driving cars is a great way to connect with communities. It takes trust to allow vehicles that drive themselves for the most part, and Austin seems to be trusting Google quite a bit.Thats a good thing.I just want to say this: If I were to ride around in Googles self-driving car, I want mine designed by Austin resident Florence Swanson. Ive never met her, but I would like to.Heres her creation:The guitar guy is an inspiration from living in Austin, TX. Austin is called the live music capital of the world.Digs music and self-driving cars? Youre my hero, Florence. Also, look how happy she is!!! Expect more of this community work in the coming months and years, as the company hopes that more cities will allow Google to use their streets as a test-course.You can catch the rest of the Austin designs here.(Oh, and if you know Florence personallysend her this link and maybe shell comment!)
