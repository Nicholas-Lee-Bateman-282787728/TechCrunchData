At its annual I/O developer conference, Google today unveiled a new hardware device and competitor to Amazon Echo, a portable speaker powered by voice assistance technology called Google Home.The device was widely rumored to have been in development under the codename Chirp, and the final product name was recently confirmed by The New York Times.Google Home FeaturesLike Echo, Google Home will also include a virtual assistant you interact with via voice. Unveiled earlier today, Google Assistant is a bit ofa rebranding of theGoogle Now voice search feature. However, the new Assistant is able to answer questions and have two-way conversations, as well asperform tasks likeplaying music, interact with smart home devices including Nest thermostats, and more.These tasks will include things like ordering flowers or checking flights  things that traditionally you do via apps or the web.A list of partners that Google hasbeen working with on itsvoice actions platform for Searchinclude a number of notable names, like Uber, Pandora, Spotify, OpenTable, Gett, Instacart, Grubhub, Mytaxi, TuneIn, HailO, WhatsApp, Saavn, Ticketmaster, and more. (see below)However, unlike Amazon Echo, Google has not yet opened up its Home platform to all third-partydevelopers. It hasnt formally announced Google Home launch partners.The Google Home Wi-Fi speaker will stream music and podcasts from the cloud, or you can send music to the speaker via Google Cast, the company said. That means that it wont be limited to Google Play Music, but should also support other services, like Spotify. It will also work with other Google Home speakers, if you have more than one  as you can direct it to play your music on a particular device.The speaker lets you customize the base with a variety of colors to match the homes style, and includes LED lights, speaker, and mic. Thats a nice feature for those not happy with the aesthetics of Amazons all-black Echo.The speaker ships later this year. Pricing has yet to be announced.Google In the HomeGoogle today has some of the best speech recognition technology in the business, but it had yet to take full advantage of that in a consumer home gadget.Its Nest thermostats have voice features, but not the sales momentum to become truly mainstream. Whats unclear, however, is if consumers are uninterested insmart thermostats in general  perhaps perceiving them as more of a luxury device  or if theyre hesitant to invite Google into their homes.The Google Home device may answer that question, as its the first time Google has made a real effort at bringing its suite of services into peoples homes.While it has launched otherconsumer gadgets  the ill-fated Nexus Q media player, its Android TV platform which runs on OEM hardware, Google Cast (previously Chromecast), the OnHub router, and so on  none have presented Google as a virtual assistant that can help you with various life tasks.When I walk into my house, I should be able to interact with the Google Assistant, saidMario Queiroz, VP Product Management at Google, who worked on Googles other hit consumer gadget, Chromecast.This is why were creating Google Home.Look and FeelEarly reports claimed the device would resemble the companys OnHub wireless router in terms of its shape and simple design.Of course, both theOnHub router and now Google Home also both look a lot like Amazons Echo speaker with their black, circular design and sleek looks. Google Home, however, is smaller, white and customizable.Thats also intentional.Amazon has found a foothold in consumers homes with its Echo speaker, which can do things likereadyou thenews, weather and traffic information, order and track Amazon packages, play music, control smart home appliances and lighting, and more. Plus, thanks to a growing ecosystem of add-on software called Skills, the Echo is attracting the attention of third-party app developers, as well.Today, via these add-ons, the Echo can also order you a pizza or an Uber, act as your personal fitness instructor, find you airplane tickets, play games, and more.Some in the industry haveeven dubbed Amazon Echo the next must-have gadget.In addition,a recent analyst report indicates that Amazon may have already sold 3 million of its smart speakers thanks in part to its aggressive promotion on Amazons site, heavy holiday advertising, and its participation in Amazons sales holiday, Amazon Prime Day. The company has since expanded the line of speakers to include lower-cost models like the Tap and Dot, and its allowing developers to use its virtual assistant Alexa in their own hardware and apps.Clearly, Google has been concerned.
