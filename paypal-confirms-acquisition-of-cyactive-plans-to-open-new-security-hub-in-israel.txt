PayPal  soon to be spinning off from parent company eBay  today confirmed its latest acquisition and move to build out its payment technology as a standalone business, and provide better protection in the growing problem of security breaches in e-commerce. It isbuying CyActive, a specialist in predictive malware detection based out of Israel. And itwill use the companys operations to kickstart a larger security hubin the country, including potentially more acquisitions.Terms of the CyActive deal are not being reported but local press reports last weekleaked out and put the price at $60 million. Specifically, PayPals CTO and SVP of payment services James Barresetold TechCrunchthat price was speculative.The security center meanwhile will tap into the countrys bigger pool of online security expertise, PayPals existing operations in the country and other potential acquisitions.The creation of the security center is an extension of the capabilities we have already developed through the success of our Fraud and Risk Detection Center in Tel Aviv, Barrese writesin a blog post.In an interview with TechCrunch he also pointed to more possible dealsin the pipeline. Well continue to make significant investments, he said.Barrese addedthe acquisition is moreabout improving PayPals security capabilities and not PayPals spinoff from eBay, but its notable that this happensto bethe second acquisition in a week for the company, after last week acquiringmobile walletcompany Paydiant  the tech provider behind merchant collective CurrentC  in a deal worth nearly $300 million.Barrese also would not comment on what will happen with CyActives existing business or how it will be integrated with PayPals existing operations.It sounds in any case likeCyActive had not developed much in terms of commercial products. Theyre still early in the product lifecycle, he said.Its interesting to consider how PayPal may use the assets. On one hand, CyActives technology would proveuseful for PayPals widernetwork protection, but there is also a case to be made for PayPal potentially developing aspects of it as a product for its online salescustomers, selling online security protection as a service alongside payment processing and other merchant services.Paypal has always had security for customers, and this is about improving those capabilities, Barrese told TechCrunch.As with many other security specialists in Israel, CyActives co-foundersLiran Tancman (CEO) andShlomi Boutnaru (CTO) have roots in Israels military intelligence.CyActives specificarea of expertise is in predicting malware before it hits a network, and then helping businesses better prepare for it, with the premise being that malware behaves like a virus: it mutates as it spreads. CyActive describes the current market as being focused too much on reactive online security, whileits technology is amore proactive antidote:The current cyber security paradigm is a reactive cycle: if and when a threat is exposed, it is analyzed and a counter-solution is designed, CyActive writes. Response times vary from weeks to years. Even if a solution is made available, attackers can easily modify the original code, evade the updated security measures, and once again a new threat is born.A recent report from FireEyenoted that e-commerceand retail businesses hadthe most security breaches in 2014, with the growth of making transactions online, and storing data in cloud-based services, a magnet to malicious hackers whofollow the money.For a company like PayPal, its important to continue investing in security technology not only to prevent these kinds of attacks, but also to demonstrate to its current and potential customers (and investors) that it is taking the issue seriously in a proactive way.It also seems like a timely announcement, coming in the wake of allegations that Apple Pay  a rival system to PayPals from the iPhone maker  is susceptible to fraud.
