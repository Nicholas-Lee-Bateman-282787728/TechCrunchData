Four years ago,Facebook announced that they weredecamping to Menlo Park from their longstanding home of Palo Alto. Just last month,the company finally cut the ribbons on a beautiful430,000-square foot building designed by Frank Gehry that is basically one giant, open-air room with an enormous park on top.Theeffect on the prices of surrounding real estate has been profound.If you look at thechart below, published last week in the Almanac and Palo Alto Weekly, the price increasesare mainlyconcentrated in Menlo Park and the neighboring city of East Palo Alto.East Palo Alto is a historically black and now majority Latino community that took shapemore than half a century ago througha legacyof raciallydiscriminatory practices in Bay Areahousing markets. Given that it is the most affordable community left in Silicon Valley, the citys economy also supplieslow-wage labor to the neighboring affluent suburbs of Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Atherton. It has a resilient, but sometimes painful history.An East Palo Alto musician named Freddy Lopez and a group of teenagersfromthe neighborhood recently made the music video and documentary above about what its like to constantly live in fear of being priced out of the community youve always known. (Some of them are affiliated with Live in Peace, the non-profit that Facebook chief product officer Chris Cox backed with $1 million earlier this year.)Its no surprise, butthose who quite literally live onthe margins of capital are the most vulnerable to its swings and busts. The price surges in East Palo Alto are moreextremebecause one-third of the citys homes went into foreclosure after the subprime crisis, only to be bid and bought back up again during the new tech boom.There is noreason thatthe prodigious levelof job creation over the last few years here hasto negatively impact low-income communities throughout the Bay Area  except for the fact that the peninsula and South Bay suburbs are clinging to a mid-20th century suburban model of development that is no longer suitable for the kind of economy we have in Northern California.The Wall Street Journal had astory on thisyesterday: space is so tight that tech companies are payingnorth of $90 a square footin Mountain View. Those are Manhattan skyscraper prices for 1980s-era suburban office parks. It is like running the entire industry on the physical equivalent of MS-DOS.Youcan either scale the physical infrastructure of the region or you can move the jobs. I favor doing both, but it seems obvious that the world is on an inexorable path towards mass urbanization and that the type of creative and collaborative work done in the industry today favors density.The younger generation in tech understands that in a knowledge-based economy, the value of what is created in Silicon Valley both economically and culturally is in the network. It depends upon who we can bring and include here  not in physicalassets like a piece of land or a home.But the peninsula cities havemajority homeowner voting bases, and their elected political bodies are incentivized to protectthese assets through slow-growth policies and exclusionaryzoning.This approachhas paid off handsomely.Palo Alto home prices, for instance,have outperformed the S&P 500 by almost2Xover the past 16 years with significantly lower volatility.And whileSan Francisco wasthesecondworst metro area in the country for producing housing in the earlier part of this decade, some of the richerpeninsula suburbshave done an even crappier job.Menlo Park permitted22 percent of its state-mandated housing projections from 2007 to 2014, while Palo Alto did 37 percent and Atherton, one of the wealthiest towns in the entire country,did 1 percent.Menlo Park wasevensued by three non-profits for not producing enough affordable housing back in 2012Even more troubling, the scaffolding that all ofthese cities and the state of California haveerected over the last 40 years to make 1960s suburban ranch homesa fantasticstore of valuealso perversely makes them attractive tonon-resident overseas capital. This has been morepronounced over the last three years afterthe Chinese property market plateauedand Xi Jinping embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, which are both driving capital offshore into foreign real estate markets and into a relatively obscure U.S.visa program called EB-5that was maxed out for the first time in its 24-year history last fall. EB-5 might be OKif its an alternate source of financing for bigprojects that may not otherwise get built like thethousands of proposedhomesinSan Franciscos Hunters Point.But not if overseas capitalends up being parked in emptyhomes, pricing would-be community members out of homeownership.In San Francisco, it appearsrelatively limited; a study from the regional think tank SPUR using 2012 data found that only 2.4 percent of housing units were left vacant by non-resident owners for seasonal use.However,the phenomenon may be larger in the suburbswhere property isntsubject to the same stringent tenant laws. Its hard to quantify because the region is split between dozens of suburbs, but anecdotally, real estate agents have told the Chronicle that more thanone-quarter of current buyers inPalo Alto arefrom China, fueling concerns about a spate ofghost homes inside the tony suburb.We need a new region-wide approach to monitoring this with data.In aggregate, the costs of this rent-seeking and zoning abuseareenormous to both Silicon Valley and the U.S. economy. Because the infrastructure and housing stock is not expanding with population growth, people are either getting forced out or are goingtoareas that have fewer job opportunities and weakersocial mobility.UC Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti and Chang-Tai Hsieh calculated in a paper last year that ifthe countrys mosteconomicallyproductive regions like Silicon Valley, New York and Boston had a more elastic housing supply, the aggregate output of the U.S. economy since 1964 would be13.5 percent larger.That is the equivalent of $2 trillion per year, or $10,000 per American.Menlo Park thankfully has engaged in some changes, with 202 units being plannedfor downtown andby allowing a 394-unit complexnear Facebooks headquarters.But this is not imaginative enough.Facebook has grown its headcount by 48 percentin the last year to just north of 10,000 employees, with roughly half of them in Menlo Park.A few hundred units isnot going to cut it.Given its market capitalization and position, Facebook is the company in the best position to re-imagine what new urbanism looks like in the old heart of Silicon Valley. In February, theyacquired a 56-acre piece of property in Menlo Park for an estimated $400 million and have signaled that they are open to doing more with it than just office space.So far,theyvehad to go and assure nearbyresidents in low-income neighborhood of Belle Haven that they are not going to be erecting nine-story buildings onit.Buttheyshould build highandthey should offermeaningful concessions  in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars  forappropriateinfrastructure or permanently affordable housing in a quid pro quodeal for dense, tall and walkable workforce housing in a mixed-use, mixed-income environment.If theyre successful, they could demonstrate to the surrounding communitiesthat post-suburbia isnt so scary after all.That would be the real Facebook effect.While it isnt ideal to have a singlefor-profit corporationinfluenceso much of acitys development policylike Google in Mountain View or Apple in Cupertino,the currentsystem of governance hasproduced a short-sighted, fragmented(and frankly selfish)approach that has not kept pacewith population growth.This ispartly why the tech industry has expandednorth into San Francisco, with ripple effectsimpactingthe Latino community in the Mission and the black community in Oakland. And if the suburban local governments in thesouth need to extract financial concessions out of theseenormous publicly-traded companiesto supportthis density, so be it. In an ideal world,in-fill development should pay for itself throughmore resident taxpayers.But unfortunately,Californias municipal and public school financing systemsare kind ofmessedup given the property tax caps that home-owning voters gave themselves under 1978s Proposition 13 and then the requirement of amajorityvote for any new revenue-generating fees or taxes under 1996s Proposition 218.These deals should also be logistically easier to work out down in the suburbs thanin San Francisco, where its likelyimpossible becausethe tech workforce comprises only roughly 7 percent of the population, is split between1,800 or so companies and doesnt haveacompany withthe market capitalization,profitability and dominance of a Google, Apple or Facebook yet.Anyway, if you are a younger tech worker that favors market-based solutions and is generally dismissive of government for being incompetent or inefficient, remember that public institutionsare only as good as the public that holds them accountable.The current system is tilted tofavor older commercial and residential property interests, whichare extremely organized and which canactually consistently turn people out to vote. Can you?And rememberthat youare already paying an extraordinary tax to be here that doesnt really do anything for infrastructure, transit or education.Itis among the highest in the nation.It is called rent.
