The market, at least initially, doesnt look very impressed: shares of VMware dropped by as much as10 percent in the wake of the news.As part of the bigger enterprise IT Dell deal, EMCs shareof VMware  which itself has a market cap of over $33 billion  will transfer to the newly combined private business in the form of a tracking stock.VMware willremain an independent and publicly traded business after the EMC deal is completed, the companies said today.VMware will remain a publicly-traded company and continue to provide customers value through leading software-defined data center technology, together with its cloud, mobile and desktop offerings, Dell noted in a statement. This transaction is expected to accelerate VMwares growth across all of its businesses through significant synergies with Dells solutions and go-to-market channels. VMware remains committed to investing in and partnering with its strong, industry ecosystem.However, during theconference call today in the wake of the Dell/EMC news, Joe Tucci  EMCs CEO who will step down  confirmed that Dell may intend to buy more of the company going forward.Michael [Dell, the CEO and chairman of Dell] intends to be a bigger owner of VMware over time, Tucci noted during the call, also noting that Michael Dell has some significant money set aside to make sure that he supports both the tracker and the common stock of VMware.Currently, EMC whichacquired VMware2004 and subsequently spun it out in 2007 owns around 80% of VMware. Around65% of thatwill go to EMC shareholders as trading stock, and post deal, Dell would own about 28% of the economic interest in VMware, the company explained on the conference call today.The priceDell pays for EMC, and its share of VMWare,will hinge on the value of the tracking stock, as Dell describes it:Under the terms of the agreement, EMC shareholders will receive $24.05 per share in cash in addition to tracking stock linked to a portion of EMCs economic interest in the VMware business. Based on the estimated number of EMC shares outstanding at the close of the transaction, EMC shareholders are expected to receive approximately 0.111 shares of new tracking stock for each EMC share. Assuming, for illustrative purposes, a valuation for each share of tracking stock of $81.78, the intraday volume-weighted average price for VMware on Wednesday, October 7, 2015, EMC shareholders would receive a total combined consideration of $33.15 per EMC share and the total transaction would be valued at approximately $67 billion. The value of the tracking stock may vary from the market price of VMware given the different characteristics and rights of the two stocks.Today, VMwareclosed over 8%down at $72.15per share.Dells move to acquire EMC is a big move ahead in a wider consolidation play, where Dell continues to build both its hardware and enterprise IT businesses.VMware says it expects Q3sales of$1.672 billion, up10% on Q3 a year ago.
