IBMclaimsthat today IBM iX is already theworlds largest digital agency at least in terms of people power, with over10,000 employees over1,100 designers.The fact that IBM has been moving so quickly in closing and announcing theselast three deals is a sign of how its trying to get more aggressive on front-end design services.The reason?
