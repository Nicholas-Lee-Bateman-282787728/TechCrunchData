Autodeskis an old school software company, having launched in 1982 and gone public in 1990, but that doesnt mean its too fixed in its ways to try something new. Today, the companyis launching a new Platform as a Service its calling Forge.com and a $100 million fund to help prime the development pump.It will essentially make 3D developmentand displaying available fordevelopersas a cloud service in the form of APIs and a software development kit (SDK)  and help fund some of the best ideas.For the majority of its existence, Autodesk has been a 3D desktop development platform concentrating on a manufacturing audience, but customer needs are changing and the company has responded by building a cloud development platform.Our customers have historically done amazing things on desktop. But the desktop has finite compute resources available and thecloud has been able to solve these [limitations] with elastic resources, Scott Reese, VP of cloud platforms at Autodesk told TechCrunch.Whats more, the way these customers have worked is changing too. What was once a linear development process from idea to engineering, building and selling has itself been transformed as products are developed more collaboratively and we are seeing more customized manufacturing driven by 3D printing.This new way of working requires a level of flexibility that is well-suited to the cloud, particularly with a resource-intensive technology like 3D design. As weve learned, just because an older company seesa need and invests ina new way of doing business, it isnt necessarily a guarantee of success. Its one thing to provide a cloud platform for building third-party applications. Its another to get developers engaged in that platform.The company believesit already has a head start on that with 4000 desktop developers, many of whom it believes it can convert to the cloud platform, whileattracting new ones. To help make that happen, Autodesk is also announcing $100 million fund to help finance some of the best ideas.The investment fund has been created to encourageinnovative ideas built on top of the platform. We are putting the money out there because we want to accelerate adoption, Reese said. He said these could take the form of strategic or equity investments.As a company with a long history of developing 3D software, it sees the cloud development platform as a natural extension of what its been doing and a way to accommodate a changing market, whileattracting a new generation of developers.Among the use cases, Reese envisions are 3D product renderings on eCommerce sites and interactive embedded 3D drawings to help explain how to install or set up a product better than any static 2D drawing ever could.Autodesk boughtSeeControl,an Internet of Things cloud companyin August and Reese could see use cases where the design can be data-driven  for example, offering predictive failure analysis forproducts.The Beta program has attracted 450 developers, which Reese says grew mostly virally with only a smallpush from Autodesk. Its notabout extending applications, but leveraging core technology around visualizations, relationships in data and making them accessible to millions of people, Reese explained.Its worth noting that thisis not Autodesks first attempt at the cloud. It also offers Autodesk as a cloud service, where users can pay as they go to use thesoftware
