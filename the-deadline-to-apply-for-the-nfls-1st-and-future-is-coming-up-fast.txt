So you may have heard that the NFL, Stanford University, and TechCrunch are teaming up to stage an epic pitch-off competition on Feb. 6 called 1stand Future. There are three themes  the Future Stadium, Bringing the Game Home, and Tomorrows Athlete  and we are looking for four awesome startups to compete in each category. If thats you, please apply here by December 9th at 9pm PT. Winning this one is huge. The top choice in each category will receive a $50k prize, a trip for two to meet with senior NFL executives, and two tickets to Super Bowl 50!We are working hard to put a great event together with the NFL and Stanford. Judge selection is coming along nicely, and trust us, the judge lineup will be as smart as it is exciting. We will be announcing the judges in a few weeks.There are a few other reminders worth mentioning too. The owners of the NFL teams will be in the audience at Stanford GSBs CEMEX auditorium, and TechCrunch will stream the proceedings live from the competition. After the pitch-off, well all retire to a reception where the pitch-off contestants can mingle with the audience. Its hard to imagine a better three hours for entrepreneurs in the right zone.
