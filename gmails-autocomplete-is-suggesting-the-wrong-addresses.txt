Update, 26/02: Google said it has now fixed the issue.Sending email to the wrong person is probably among the top five most awkward things you can do in a professional context. Whether youve accidentally let confidential info slip to a third party or simply aired frustration to someone who doesnt need to hear it, dealing with mis-sent email is never fun.Hence the frustration coming from Gmail power users dealing with an auto-complete bug in the recipient field. Over the last few days, a number of venture capital and startup folk have come forward with complaints ranging from mild frustration to anger:The incipient malevolent human-murdering AI inside GMail just autocompleted an address I've emailed once over one I've emailed 10,000 times.

Alexia Tsotsis (@alexia) February 23, 2015@alexia @sama clearly an autocomplete bug. i had it sat & fixed via restart (but not working for others). @gmail stays silent  guys?
