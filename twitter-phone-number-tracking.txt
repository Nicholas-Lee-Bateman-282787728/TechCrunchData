Twitter has a troll problem. Even its CEO knows it. And now the company is doing more to prevent its users sufferingabuse and threats onits service.In a bid to make improvements,Twitter has announcednew measuresto expandtheprocess for reporting user safety concerns, and a system that usesphone numbers to preventthosewho repeatedly harassothers from creating new accounts.The Verge reportedthat Twitter will begin tracking phone numbers for known trolls.The problem here is thatserial trolls can easily (and quickly) open new accounts and resume their harassmentif Twitter shuts their account down. Identifying them by their phone number can helptrack these efforts to start over, and ultimately keep them and their vitriolic behavior off of the service.Twitter currently makes associatingan account witha phone number optional, but The Verge said that in cases where a useris found to be harassing others, their account may be temporarily banned until they providetheir number. That number (and the email address used to registerthe account) wouldthen be checked against a list of known trolls to decide whether a full ban is necessary. Its not a perfect solution  the troll could abandon the banned account and open a new one without supplying a number but it is certainlya positive step forward.Twitter is also expanding an initiative from last yearthatallowedbystanders to report abuse previously itwas limited to the victim only. Now it is taking that same approach for instances of self-harm, impersonation, and the publishing of private information.The company revealed that it has tripled the size of its support team in line with its increased focus onsafety. In particular,Twitter said that it now seesfive times more reports afterit began allowing third parties to flag abuses.
