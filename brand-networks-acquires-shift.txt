Social marketing company Brand Networks continues to gobble up the competition  it just announced that its acquiring Shift in a $50 million cash-and-stock deal.Back in 2013, it acquired Optimal, another social media advertising company. Brand Networks founder and CEO Jamie Tedford (pictured above) said the success of our own business on-boarding Optimal made him confident about integrating Shift.Tedford added that his company and Shift (previously known as GraphEffect) have been friendly competitors for many years, and that it was an attractive acquisition because of Shifts technology, its team and its client list.Shift co-founder and CEO James Borow will become chief product officer at Brand Networks (a role once held by Optimals Rob Leathern, whos now working on a new startup), and he said a very large portion of his team is moving over as part of the acquisition.Our goal was always to have a complete social marketing platform, Borow said  and in his view, combining the Brand Networks and Shift products accomplishes that goal.The companies are already releasing the first steps in this integration by launching Shifts RelevanceRank technology across the Brand Networks platform. That means Brand Networks can now score any piece of content based on how it will perform on different social advertising environments, and also recommend when a marketer should increase their budget to give something a bigger boost.As different as we are, were a hell of a lot more similar in many ways, he said. Weve all, for the past five years, been looking at Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, and really been about combining all these worlds.The two companies say they collectively manage more than $500 million in advertising spending for 650 brands and agencies, including Interpublic Group, WPP, AT&T, Yahoo and Unilever. Brand Networks raised a single, $68 million funding round, while Shift had raised $14 million in funding.
