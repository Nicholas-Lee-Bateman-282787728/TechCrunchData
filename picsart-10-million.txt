Picsart, a mobilephotoediting app and community that claims 60 million monthly users, has closed $10 million in funding from Sequoia Capital.This is the first outside investment that Picsart has taken, having bootstrapped itself to profitability after being founded in Armenia, an Eastern European country that isnt exactlywell-known for birthingtech startups.Picsart  which has been downloaded over 200 million times to date  differentiates itself from Instagram, which Sequoia invested in, and others by placing emphasis on its photo-editing features. The app allows users to add text, stickers and make other tweaks beyond those that Facebook-owned Instagram offers.Like Instagram, Picsart has its social network-like community, whileusers can also post to other services and viewphotos atPicsart.com.Instagram is a social channel, were a creative platform and community, Picsarts US-based Chief Revenue Officer Wilson Kriegel told TechCrunch in an interview. We believe that were an amplifier to what Instagram provides.Kriegel said that the company was not short on offers when it came to raising, and that leverage gave it greater choice on how much it raised, and who from. Sequoias experiencescaling tech startups likeInstagram and WhatsApp was a major reason for selecting it as partner, he added.The capital itself will go towards accelerating the growth of Picsarts userbase, and, in particular, expanding its business with new partnerships and opportunities in the U.S. market.As part of that push, Sequoia partner (and AdMob founder) Omar Hamoui will join the Picsart board, while CEO Hovhannes Avoyan will relocate to the U.S. to join Kriegel at the startups San Francisco office, which will lead the direction of the product and bring innew staff. Picsart COO Artavazd Mehrabyan will remain at its base in Armenia, where the company has over 55 engineers.Kriegel said that the company is focused on working with third party partners  including handset makers  to boost adoption of its service. He didnt specifically mention pre-bundling on devices, but that strategy would be a logical way to expand visibility and usage of Picsart.Picsarts current userbase is fairly evenly spread across the world, with around one-quarter in the U.S., Kriegel said. In addition to the U.S., the company is also setting its sights on growing in Asia  hementioned the potential of Korea, while it recently introduced anAPK to a number of third-party app stores in China.Kriegel revealed thatPicsart is working extremely hard to penetrate China, and its efforts there may include partnerships with established companies who know the lay of the land.Photo apps are a seriously congested space, but Kriegel believes that Picsarts deep focus onediting  which he hinted could include video  is what separates it from the rest of the field.So far, nobody has captured communication around content, topics and interests, he commented. We really offer creative expression, were empowering whats already been taking place [with the adoption of photo apps] to give self-expression customization to our users.That view is echoed by Sequoias Hamoui.The first generation of photo apps were based primarily on sharing. PicsArts rapid, organic growth makes the case that the next era of expression will be based not only on sharing, but creativity and collaboration as well, headded.
