If youre a regular person looking to shootsome video, its hard to complain about the many, many options available. Heck, the iPhone camera is good enough at this point that its been used to shoot a critically acclaimed feature film.But unless youre a video professional, theres still one big limitation  youre probablyrecording with a single camera. Sure, thats fine if youre looking to capture something brief, but if youre filming a longer event (say, a concert, or a baseball game), being locked into single viewpoint can get pretty dull, pretty quickly.Thats why Livestream is announcing a new productat this years Consumer Electronics Show, called the Movi. It creates the illusion that youve captured the event from multiple cameras, rather than a single, pocket-sized device.To use it, you put the camera in place, then use your iPhone (only iPhones will be supported initially) to edit on-the-fly. Movi will automatically detect faces and other points of interest, so you just tap to cut between the different musicians at a concert or the different speakers at a press conference. You can also manually create points of interest or zoom at-will.Conversely, if you want to be completely hands-off, you can have Movi do the editing automatically  it probably wont have the smarts of a human editor, but it can detect when someones speaking or when theres other activity of interest.No one wants to go home and edit for hours in FinalCut Pro  and certainly no one can afford to show up at an event with three cameras and cameramen, said Livestream founder Max Haot.He added that Livestream is launching Movias a separate brand because you dont actually need to share this footage live  Movi will integrate with the companys existing livestreaming services, but you can also just record the video and share later.To be clear, youre still shooting with one physical camera, so ultimately, youre limited to the footage that asinglecamera can capture. However, when Haot demonstrated Movi for me (mostly using pre-shot footage, but also using a live camera to prove that it works), it really did offer a lot of the visual variety and energy that you get from a multi-camera setup.Haot also said Movi users mighteventually be able to buy two or more physical cameras and cut between them. That wont be available at release, however, partly to avoid confusion: We obviously didnt want people to buy five cameras or think they need five cameras.On its own, the Movi battery is only estimated to last for an hour. If you need to record for longer than that, you can plug it in, or you could buy the Movi Boost, an accessory that offers 10 hours of battery life and could also make it easier to mount or carry the camera.Livestream plans to ship the product in April with a $399 price tag.Its currently available for a $199 pre-order.
