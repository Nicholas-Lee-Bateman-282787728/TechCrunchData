Microsoft announced this morning two components of Windows 10, its next operating system, that will help users log into both hardware and digital services.Windows Hello will allow users with machines that have the required hardware to log into their computing device using their face, eyes, or fingerprint. Not all machines will run Windows Hello. Microsoft noted in a blog post that computers that already sport fingerprint scanners will be supported, andthat it is excited to announce that computers built by partners that incorporate existing Intel technology  its RealSense camera  will support the iris and face-based sign-in features.Interestingly, Microsoft claims that Hello contains enterprise-grade security. So, not only will you be able to log into your Windows 10 machine with the equivalent of a quick selfie1, Microsoft thinks that youll be safer for having done so. I have yet to test the technology, but presuming that it works well, itwill be a popular tool.Next up is Passport, a new set of programming tools that allow Windows 10 to authenticate to various digital services such as applications that a user is who they claim. And as Windows 10 is vouching for your person, no password has to trade hands, which keeps a users passwords more secure.Passport proves a users identity either through a device-based PIN or Windows Hello.You will be able to log into Windows 10 by staring at your computer, which will also unlock a number of online services and applications. Fewerpasswords? Ill take it.1. Dude, stop taking selfies. What, Im trying to log in.
