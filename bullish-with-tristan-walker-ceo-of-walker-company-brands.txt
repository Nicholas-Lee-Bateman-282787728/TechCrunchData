Tristan Walker is becoming, if hes not already, a household name in Silicon Valley. Hes the founder and CEO of Walker & Company Brands, the startup behind the successful Bevel razor and shaving cream products for people of color.I first spoke withWalkerin December 2013, when helaunched his company, while writing for Business Insider. He was in the San Francisco Bay Area and I was in New York, so we could only chat over the phone.So, I was super pumped (proof at bottom of post) to finally meet him IRL for what turned out to be an amazing episode of Bullish.In todays episode of Bullish, Walker and I chatted about how personal health and beauty startups fit into Silicon Valley (spoiler: they dont), getting VCs to back these kinds of startups, misconceptions around Walker &Co. Brands market opportunity, and a lot more.The funny thing about Walker & Co. Brands being a niche opportunity is that its not at all, Walker told me. Were targeting a consumer group thats the majority of the world, if you think about black, Latino, Asian consumers. And by 2040, theyll make upthe majority of the U.S. Walker went on to say that what hes doing is actually the opposite of niche.If theres anything Ive said that Id like folks to really take with them is, really dont let your lack of context cloud your judgment, Walker said. There are opportunities out there that are significant, and just because youre not a part of the demographic that were serving, doesnt mean theres not a significant opportunity.Me before the shoot with Tristan WalkerScroll back up to the top to watch the whole interview.
