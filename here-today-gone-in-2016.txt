Nokia has announced that it has agreed to sell its HERE mapping business to a consortium of automobile makers for 2.8 billion ($3.07 billion), ending months of speculation over itsfuture.The Finnish company confirmed that it will hand the business over toAUDI AG, BMW Group and Daimler AG (Mercedes) in a deal that is expected to closein the first quarter of next year.The future of HERE has been up in the air since Nokia completed the sale ofits devices business to Microsoftlast year. In April of this year, Nokia confirmed itwas reviewing options for HERE,one outcome of whichwas a sale.It isnt initially clear whether any, or indeed how many, of HEREs 6,454 staff will be let go following the closure of the deal. That sizable headcount is thought to be one reason why Nokia was keen to offload HERE, which pulls in aroundone-tenth of the revenue thatNokia Networks accounts for, according tothe latest financials.HERE was speculated to have attracted significant interest from a variety of different companies across the world. Aside from the car firms, a joint bid from Uber and (its investor) Baidu was highly speculated, while ChinasNavinfo, and even the likes of Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook and Apple were rumored to have expressed interest.As TechCrunchs Ingrid Lunden explained when assessing the bidders last month, the businesss location technology patents, databases and location attributes (which a former senior HERE employee pegged at 300), made it one of the biggest and more valuable mapping assets to come to the market in years.Nokia is expected to complete its $16.6 billion dealto buy Alcatel-Lucentby the first half of next year. These deals will leave the firmwithNokia Networks, its broadband infrastructure business, and Nokia Technologies, an advanced technology and development unit thatintendsto work with manufacturers torelease new mobile devices in 2016.In an internalinterview, President Sean Fernback said HEREwouldbecome a much stronger company that will remain independent and neutral  the Switzerland of maps  following the acquisition.
