The UK government is continuing to try to pushmuch criticized surveillance powers legislation through parliament, with thebill in question  the Investigatory Powers bill  getting its second reading in Parliament tomorrow.However the opposition Labour Party, which was initially welcoming when the government introduced the bill last fall, has said itwill be abstaining in thisvote  arguingthe government needs to do more to bolster privacy protections.Speaking to The Timestoday, Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham said substantial changes are needed before the party will be willing to vote for the bill.Three committees which looked at the first draft of the legislation all had substantial criticisms  and some, such as the Intelligence and Security Committee, were highly critical.Critics have said the government has made only cosmetic tweaks since then, with manyarguing theamended draft is  if anything even worse than the original draft. Last week, for example, Eric King, deputy director of humansrights group Privacy International, told TechCrunchthat bulk hacking powers set out in the bill amount to the worst form of a backdoor.The Home Secretarys Bill requires substantial changes before it will be acceptable to us. While I share her wish to see a comprehensive Bill on the Statute Book by the end of this year, we cant let the timetable dictate the quality. On Tuesday, I will make clear to the Home Secretary that, if she fails to listen to our concerns, Labour will be prepared to delay this legislation so that we get it right, LaboursBurnhamtold the Times newspaper.We believe the Bill must start with a presumption of privacy, as recommended by the Intelligence and Security Committee, include a clearer definition of the information that can be held in an Internet Connection Record and set a higher threshold to justify access to them. There also needs to be a higher degree of protection for journalists and their sources, he added.Asked why the party is not going to be actively votingagainst the bill, if it believes there are fundamental problems with it, a spokesman for Burnham told TechCrunch the party supports the idea that new legislationis needed in this area so does not want to actively block abill. Rather it hopes to be able to work towards improving it.We think theres a need for a bill  were not against one completely. We want the debate to continue so that the government can listen to our arguments, said the spokesman. We dont want to play politics with it, its about making the best piece of legislation that we can do and not rushing it. So the government have got our support for making a bill to improve [the investigatory powers framework] so we couldnt vote for it and give them a blank cheque. We didnt just want to stop it by voting against it tomorrow. So were going to abstain so that the debate continues and the government can hopefully take on board some of our criticisms.The spokesman addedthe partywould be willing to see the legislativetimeframeextended to2017, rather than trying to rush a bad bill through parliament this year.If they dont take on board any of the criticisms we dont rule out delaying it, asking the government to extend the current legislation that expires in December and making the debate on this bill go into 2017  if they dont listen to us on points of privacy, thresholds, historical abuses, exact definitions on Internet Connection Records (ICRs), he said.ICR refers to the requirement placed on ISPs to maintain a log of the web servicesaccessed by users for a full 12 months. Critics have called this element of the proposals a massive privacy invasion and a huge security risk, given that ISPs will be required to store and safeguard the citizens ICRs themselves. And questions remain about how much this will cost  and how much of those costs the government will commit to covering.Burnham will be giving a speech in Parliament tomorrow setting out the Labour partys concerns in greater detail which the spokesman said willinclude detailed arguments pertaining tothe controversial bulk powers contained within the legislation.Some of our concerns are based on the committees concerns and were trying to get those safeguards and assurances written into the bill that the committees wanted to see, he added. The bill needs things rewriting and clearer definitions but we can work with this bill and improve it. Rather than ask for a whole new bill.How utterly disappointing Andy Burnham has decided Labour will not vote against the #ipbill tomorrow. I hope many Labour MPs will rebel #fb Julian Huppert (@julianhuppert) March 14, 2016I hope Labour at least vote against any programme motions otherwise they will be complicit in rushing #ipbill through. We deserve better #fb Julian Huppert (@julianhuppert) March 14, 2016
