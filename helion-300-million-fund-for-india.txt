Theres another new startup fountainin town in India, after Helion Venture Partners announced its fourth fund worth $300 million.Helion is the latest in a flurry of firmsto raise money for investments in fast-growing India. Accel last month announced a $305 million fund, while Tiger Global, Sequoia, SoftBank, SAIF, Lightbox VC, and smaller players like 500 Startups andBlume Ventures have eachcommitted money to the country over the past year.With its new fund, Helion  which includes Housing.com, TaxiForSure, and Komliamong its portfoliois again targeting early to mid stage tech startups in India. Typical investments will range from $1 million to $10 million, and the fund is expected to last for three to four years, according to Helion co-founderSanjeev Aggarwal.The fourth fund is around the same size as Helions thirdfund. Despite the fact that Indias startup and investment scene has taken off in a major way this year, the company resisted the temptation to raise more in order to stick to its niche, Aggarwal explained in an interview withTechCrunch.We really understand the early stage investment space best, and we want to stay within our zone of competency. Larger pools of capital give a high possibility of strategy drift, he said.Helion, which was founded in 2009,will put aroundthree-quarters of the fund towards startups that are helping digitize the national economy, for example those involved in retail, travel, insurance and, loans, Aggarwal said. The remainder will be set asidefor Indian companies with the potential to do business globally, for example analytics, enterprise software and other next generation outsourcing businesses.In addition to the growth in smartphones and mobile internet in India,Helion co-founderAggarwal said other factors are helping Indias startup market mature.Thequality of entrepreneurs has raised, he said. Previously many graduates preferred a career doingconsulting or investment banking, but that isshifting in favor of entrepreneurship. Andnow people have aspirations to build products from India for the globe.That makes for more fertile grounds for VC firms, and Helion believes that its brand  a VC companyset up by entrepreneurswithfounders and managing execs as partners  helps itempathize with entrepreneurs.We haveaunique portfolio services team, which work with entrepreneurs post-investment  a lot of founders are younger and need help scaling,Aggarwal explained.
