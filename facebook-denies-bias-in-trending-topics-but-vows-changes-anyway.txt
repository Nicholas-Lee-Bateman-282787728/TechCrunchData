Facebook responded today to official queries regarding its Trending Topics feature, specifically allegations made over the last few weeks that the team responsible for it was deliberately suppressing conservative views and arbitrarily elevating stories with little oversight.In a press release issued publicly and in a letter (PDF) sent directly to Senator John Thune (R-SD), Facebook denied the allegations, but nevertheless announced a number of changes to internal processes that should help appease critics.Our investigation has revealed no evidence of systematic political bias in the selection or prominence of stories included in the Trending Topics feature. In fact, our analysis indicated that the rates of approval of conservative and liberal topics are virtually identical in Trending Topics.At the same time, as you would expect with an inquiry of this nature, our investigation could not exclude the possibility of isolated improper actions or unintentional bias in the implementation of our guidelines or policies.Specifically, Facebook looked at how and when stories were boosted, blacklisted, or submitted to injection, or correction  and found that rates have been virtually identical for liberal and conservative topics.Among the changes to the program are additional controls and oversight around the review team  and presumably further oversight of the oversight team itself, since watching the watchers is highly important in a situation like this, with an editorial team encapsulated within a decidedly non-editorial environment.In addition to the extra red tape, the process of finding and selecting Trending Topics items is getting a makeover:If you were curious about the exact process by which a story goes from hashtag or local news to Trending Topic, read the letter to Sen. Thune; it contains lots of previously unknown details, though many will now be obsolete. Specific allegations of bias  for instance, that stories about Glenn Beck (who wrote an interesting take on his own meeting with Facebook on this topic) were suppressed  are also addressed.Senator Thune issued his own statement today as well, praising Facebooks handling of the issue but at the same time getting a couple jabs in.The seriousness with which Facebook has treated these allegations and its desire to serve as an open platform for all viewpoints is evident and encouraging and I look forward to the companys actions meeting its public rhetoric.Facebooks description of the methodology it uses for determining the trending content it highlights for users is far different from and more detailed than what it offered prior to our questions.In other words: why did it take a major potential scandal for Facebook to offer details on how this high-visibility feature worked? A FAQ on the topic might have avoided the controversy altogether.No further action appears to be necessary, Sen. Thune concluded: While the [Senate Commerce] committee remains open to new information on this matter, transparency  not regulation  remains the goal.
