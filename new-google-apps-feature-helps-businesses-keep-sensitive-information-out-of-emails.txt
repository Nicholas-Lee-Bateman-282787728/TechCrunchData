Google is launching a new privacy toolfor GoogleApps Unlimitedusers today. The new Data Loss Preventionfeaturewill make it easier for businesses to make sure that their employees dont mistakenly (or not so mistakenly) email certain types of sensitive information to people outside of the company.Businesses that subscribe to this plan for their employees now have the option to turn on this tool and select one of the new predefined rules that, for example, automatically reject or quarantine any email that contains a social security or credit card number. Businesses can choose from these predefined rules and also set up custom detectors (a confidential project keyword, for example). Google says its working on adding more predefined rules, too.Google created a set of pre-defined rules for data like social security numbers in the U.S., Canada and France, drivers license and National Health Service numbers in the U.K., as well as for all credit card numbers, bank routing numbers and Swift codes for bank account numbers.Its worth noting that Google will scan both the email body and attachments for potential matches.Rules can be applied to incoming and outgoing messages. Admins are also able to apply these rules to specific departments and employees. For internal messages, they are also able to add a line like [Internal Only] to emails that contain information that would have been rejected if the sender had tried to send this email to an external recipient.
