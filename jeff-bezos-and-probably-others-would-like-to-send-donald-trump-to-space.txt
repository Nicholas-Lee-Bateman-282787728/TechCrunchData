Trump, Trump, Trump. I know, youre probably tired of hearing about him but he just wont go away. And its not even really full-on election season yet.One of his latest Twitter barks (and there have been many) was at CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos:The @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by  @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015Sick burn, right? Well, Bezos came back with this whopper:Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace https://t.co/9OypFoxZk3 Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 7, 2015Lets get to the space ride, though. Does he have to pay for his seat? I hope so. Although my main question is, Does it have a return flight? Lets hope not.BONUS: Follow the funny hashtag #SendDonaldToSpace in realtime.
