Earlier today, we speculated that billionaire Peter Thiel may havesecretly financed a lawsuit to put Gawker Media out of business owing to a series of antagonistic stories about him written by Gawkers now defunct Valleywag site nearly a decade ago.Thiel has since talked with New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and confirmed that not only has he providedHulk Hogan (legally Terry Bollea) with $10 million to battle Gawker over a sex tape it released of the former wrestling star, but Thiellong ago decided hed do what he could to put Gawker out of business.Its less about revenge and more about specific deterrence, ThieltoldSorkin. I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.Thiel went on to explain thathe had decided several years ago to secretly fund multiple cases to try to cripple Gawker, saying if he didnt fight on behalf of Gawkersvictims, he feared no one would.His first step was to hire alegal team to look for cases that he could help financially support. Asked by Sorkin what other cases he has funded, Thieldeclined to offer details, saying only that, Its safe to say this is not the only one.Thiels admission is understandably being met with very divided reactions. While some think Thiel is right to stick it to an outlet that at times seemed to rely on tormenting him to meet its traffic targets, others  including reporters and First Amendment specialists expressed concern today that Thiel and other wealthy benefactors could effectively silence journalists and other critics by funding lawsuits against them.Indeed, though not illegal or new American Lawyer says more third parties are covering legal fees than ever before  the suddenly high-profile case has seeminglyraised awareness about thepractice, for better or worse.
