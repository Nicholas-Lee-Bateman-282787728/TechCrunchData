T-Mobile had another of its un-carrier events today, whichnow have so many regular giveaways they are starting to look like an episode of Oprah.First, the company announced that every current T-Mobile account holderon a postpaid plan will get one share of common stock in the company, which is currently worth about $43. New qualifying customers will also get one share once they sign up with T-Mobile.Plus, existing customers will be able to earn another free share (or two if youve been a customer foroverfive years) for each new customer they refer to the company  maxing out at 100 shares a year.The prospectus for the offering is here, and gives a little more color on how exactly the promotion will work.Once a customer redeems the share via T-Mobiles new app, the security will be held in a brokerage account atLOYAL3 Securities. Stockholders can then hold on to their new investment, sell their shares via the platform or transfer their shares to another brokerage account. Customers can even electronicallyparticipate inproxy votes to vote their shares. Notably, instead of issuing additional shares, T-Mobile says shares needed to meet the needs of the program will be purchased on the open markets.T-Mobile also launched something called T-Mobile Tuesdays, which is a new app that rewards customers every Tuesday with free stuff. These will include things from brands like Wendys, StubHub, Dominos, etc.For the first week, the company will give away a free small frosty at Wendys, and a free movie ticket to see Warcraft. These brands aremore than likely offering the product at a discounted (or even free) price toT-Mobile to pass along to users, hoping to take advantage of the promotional reach of the cell phone companys 65 million customers.Lastly, the company announced that all users who have already tried T-Mobiles Wi-Fi calling feature will get an hour of free Gogo internet every time they fly. Gogos spotty speeds make this benefit a little less valuable than others, but its the thought that counts  at least until Gogo finishes overhauling planes with its faster satellite-based service. Users will continue to get unlimited free in-flight texting on any Gogo-enabled planes.All in all, the three new promotions are pretty huge, and while T-Mobiles past giveaways now make this look like a regular thing, the reality is that these are all great bonuses that could legitimately sway new users deciding between different cell companies.
