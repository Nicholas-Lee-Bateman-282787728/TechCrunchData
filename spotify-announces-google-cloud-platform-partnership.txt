Spotify announced today on their news blog that they have selected Google Cloud Platform as an infrastructure partner fortheir popular music streaming service. Up until now, it appears Spotify has been managing that hardware burden themselves via multiple providers and data centers (including Amazon Web Services for whom they were an AWS case study). Howeverthe music company feelsthe robustness of cloud platform products have now reached a level of maturity and they are comfortableoutsourcing.Spotify claims its a big deal for them to work with a cloud leader like Google, but its also a big deal for Google that an industry leader in the streaming category would choose them. Certainly, Spotify could have chosen to expand service with AWS or even picked Microsofts Azure cloud offeringto be at the foundation of theirservice.Instead they chose the Google team led by Diane Greene (who became headof Googles enterprise cloud businesswhen the Mountain View behemoth acquired her startup called Beebopback in November).And while mostly giving Google a pat on the back with this announcement, I felt like it stopped just short of a resounding endorsement when Spotify noted that its a competitive space and we expect the big players to be battling it out for the foreseeable future almost as if to say we always have options. But maybe Im the only one who read it that way.No doubt, there will be a lot fewer headaches in the infrastructure department at Spotify.
