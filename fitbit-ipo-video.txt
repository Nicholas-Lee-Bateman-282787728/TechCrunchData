As signs outside the New York Stock Exchange declared that Wall Street Is Getting Fit, activity tracking company Fitbit began public trading today. It quickly surged to 50-plus percent above its IPO price and held steady for the rest of the day.Today, Clavier said, theres an ecosystem built up around hardware startups in a massive way, but he recalled backing the Fitbit in what he called the dark ages of hardware investing.Clearly, hardware is super hard, he said. There are a ton of design issues, contracts, manufacturing quality, its really a completely different playbook. And to be very candid, when I invested in Fitbit, I had no clue as to how hard that was going to be. So I feel very very lucky that we end up today listing on NYSE.
