The official opposition Labour party in the UK has again called on the government to make changes to draft surveillance legislationto improveprivacy safeguards.The government is aiming to havethe Investigatory Powers Bill (IP Bill), currently before parliament,on the statute books before the end of the year  giving the Labour party a stronger hand to push for amendmentsthan it might if the government was in less of a rush to drive the bill through parliament.Writing a letter to the Home Secretary today, Labours Shadow Home Secretary, Andy Burnham, reiterated calls he made last month for a seriesof changes to the legislation, saying that in Labours viewthecurrent draft is still some way from achieving what be dubbed an essentialbalance between expanded security service capabilities and safeguards topublic data.Among the changes Burnham is calling for are a tighterdefinition of Internet Connection Records (aka the logof websites accessed by users which ISPs will be required to retain for 12 months), plus greater limits on what ICRdata can be used for and thepublic bodies that can access it; and an independent assessment of the case for bulk powers (aka mass surveillance powers such as mass hacking warrants).On the bulk powers point,Burnham adds: I would be open to a discussion about the various forms this independent review could take but it is imperative that we get it up and running. I will consider carefully the nature and extent of the bulk powers in this Bill in light of the review.The Labour party abstained from voting on the IP bill at the second reading in parliament, rather than actively voting against it  thereby enablingitto moveto the next stage of legislative scrutiny without any major opposition. But theres amore explicit threat ofdisruption to the governments plans if Labours calls for changesare not heeded.If I determine that our concerns are not satisfactorily dealt with during the passage of the Bill, then we will be unable to support a timetable that puts the Bill on the Statute Book by December this year,Burnham added.Despite stating concerns forprivacy  andcalling for the bill to includeapresumption of peoples right to privacy  Labour is nonetheless apparently quietly accepting of the ideaof the systematic state logging of allwebsites accessed by UK web users for a full year. Aka ICRs.And while Burnham writes of ICRs being a powerful new capability, he does not query the proportionality of the capability, nor the security risks posed by requiring ISPs store such a honeypot of data on a rolling yearly basis  merely calling for ICRsto be more tightly defined and access to them controlled.And leaving others outside government to express concerns on thisFor example, @AndyburnhamMP is concerned about the details of ICRs: he should be concerned about the whole idea of ICRs #IPBill Paul Bernal (@PaulbernalUK) April 4, 2016
