Twitter is giving advertisers a new way to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.The company is making this data available through what its calling conversion lift reports. Those reports are supposed to measure whether Twitter ads actually leadto an improvement in whatever business metric youre focused on, whether its website clicks/signups, mobile app installs and re-engagement, or switching mobile carriers. (That last ones, uh, pretty specific.)In a blog post, the company writes:As all performance marketers know, understanding the incremental contribution of the clicks and views on your ad campaign is critical  particularly when youre running mobile or cross-device campaigns. Last-click attribution is an inaccurate reflection of whats driving results, because the average customer switches between multiple devices, platforms, and sites before making a purchase.The company already offers conversion trackingfor advertisers,but these new reports go further, with custom data across devices and specific recommendations on how to make your ads more effective.In early tests, the company says that users who saw a Promoted Tweet were 1.4 times as likely to convert on the advertisers website, while those who engaged with a tweet were 3.2 times as likely.Facebook has also been rolling out new featuresto measure conversion lift and optimize ads based on that data.
