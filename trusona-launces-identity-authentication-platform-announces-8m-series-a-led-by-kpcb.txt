Trusona, launching today from stealth, is unveiling their iOS mobile identity authentication technology which helpsensure the identity of the person on the other side of the login, while also combatting malicious session replay attacks.Whether a company is looking to verify the identity of system admins logging in from home or a call center is trying toensure theyre talking to the actual account owner, Trusona offers authentication in a process thats actually pretty ingenious.Identity authentication through Trusona begins with a physical in-person confirmation of identity which can be done in a variety of ways, either through identity confirmation with the USPS upon reception of the TruToken orthrough providing youremployer with personaldocuments.The TruTokenOnce you receive your TruToken and are verified, you swipe three personal cards in your wallet as a confirmation of your identity. These become your authentication keys. Now, they couldbe a credit card, a drivers license of a Chuck E. Cheese gift card, really anything with a unique magnetic strip thats something you will consistentlyhave on you.The technology has some pretty interesting safeguardsspecifically designed to ward off a cyberattack known as a session replay.Replaysessentially intercept and retarget data to maliciously gain login access. The TruToken rebuffs these attacksby not only verifying the identification card used but also by trackingthe manner in which the card is physically swiped. If a session replay retargets the app with the identical interceptedcredentials, it will be deniedaccess as its impossible that the exact physical speed and manner of two physical swipes will be the same.Trusona CEO Ori Eisen tell me that he knows this tech works because the coretechnology has been available forATM usersacross the country for the last several years and through more than 119 million instances without ever once failing.Right now, the service is largely focused towards enterprises with sensitive access, including banks, brokerage houses, healthcare companies as well as the hosts of companies inneed of more stringent system admin authentication.Trusonas pricing structure is aiming to be pretty straightforward. The company charges a flat rate of $99 per person for the initial sign-up service, including verification and the physical TruToken, but after that its a $1 charge per verification used throughthe service.Accompanying news of the launch from stealth, the Scottsdale, Arizona-based company also announced the completion of an$8 million Series A led by Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers.In my nearly two decades as an investor, Trusona is one of the few solutions poised torevolutionize how we think about security and our personal information, said Ted Schlein, GPat KPCB. I couldnt wait to bepart of a team with vision as unique and potentially influential.
