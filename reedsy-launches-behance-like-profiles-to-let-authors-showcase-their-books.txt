Reedsy just launched author profiles on its website where writers can collect and showcase their work on a single page. This way, Reedsy provides a simple way to share your profile on the web, much like an About.me link.As a reminder, Reedsy unbundles the good old publishing company and provides all the services you need to self publish a book. The startup helps you find an editor, copy editor and cover illustrator to turn your draft into a book.The new profiles are very reminiscent of Behance profiles, a LinkedIn for visual artists that was acquired by Adobe in 2012. On Reedsy, authors can create a portfolio of books, pull their latest blog posts, add a bio, social media links and more.Fans can then follow a particular author by entering their email address so that they will get regular updates. An author can then download an email list of its followers or synchronize it with MailChimp. In other words, authors retain control over their fan base.Just like on About.me, authors can customize the design a bit by uploading a cover photo, tweaking the content blocks and more. Reedsy also tracks visits and let profile owners see how many people visited their page.Since I last covered Reedsy, the London-based startup has closed an initial round of financing with Seedcamp, Scottish publishing company DC Thomson, DN Capital, Kima Ventures and a few business angels, such as Lean Analytics author Ben Yoskovitz.Editors, copy editors, illustrators all had their profiles on Reedsy already. But it turns out authors wanted a simple way to create a homepage as well. Todays new profile links could also end up being printed on the back cover of many authors books, which would be a nice nod to the startup.
