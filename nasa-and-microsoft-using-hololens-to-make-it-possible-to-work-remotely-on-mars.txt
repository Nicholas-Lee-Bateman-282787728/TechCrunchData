Microsoft and NASA are teaming up to make remote working on the Red Planet a reality, using the newly announced HoloLens headset, and the Windows Holographic technology that it supports. The platform is called OnSight and is being developed out of NASAs Pasadena-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It uses the Mars Curiosity rover as effectively a telepresence bot for scientists working out of the relative comforts of Earths atmosphere.Data piped from Curiosity will allow the OnSight software to build a 3D simulation of its surroundings on Mars, which scientists will be able to check out first-hand thanks to HoloLens ability to project virtual environments onto physical surroundings. The scientists will then be able to examine whats being worked on by Curiosity from a first-person perspective, and then plan future activities for the rover to complete, as well as see simulations of their likely results.HoloLens and the holographic computing MS is using with the headset wont just pipe a 3D recreation of the Martian landscape to scientists. Itll also overlay the imagery with information, distances, readings and other sensor data and supplemental knowledge to help scientists experience Curiositys viewpoint in a way that lets them work within the simulation directly, rather than having to pop out to check some detail on a nearby terminal.OnSight is part of JPLs ongoing research into robot-controlled spacecraft and exploration equipment, meaning we could eventually see more robot missions to Mars before we send humans up there to check things out first-hand. Curiosity operationsinvolving the OnSight tech are slated to kick off later this year, and HoloLens and Microsofts crazy AR innovations could be included in Mars 2020 rover missions, NASA says.I literally just finished reading The Martian, soI cant close without mentioning thatthis probably wouldve helped a lot with the rescue of Mark Watney, had HoloLens and OnSight existed in that fictional near future.
