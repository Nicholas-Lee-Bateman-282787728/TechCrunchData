Splash, the event page service that lets anyone create beautiful event landing pages, has announced an integration with Giphy, the betaworks-backed GIF search engine.This makes Splash the only event site platform with a direct Giphy integration.Through the partnership, Splash users will have full access to Giphys library of millions of GIFs direct from the Splash Dash, where event pages are created.Previously, adding a GIF to a Splash event page was nearly impossible, but with the new integration its as easy as clicking a button, typing in a term, and choosing a GIF.Splash has been around since 2011, offering users a way to make highly customizable event landing pages. The company works on a freemium model, offering a free tier to the average user and a paid, enterprise tier for corporate clients who use the platform all the time.Giphy, on the other hand, launched in 2013 and has, with brute force, integrated with a number of big-name platforms including Facebook Messenger and Slack.If you want to check out the new Splash + Giphy, check out the announcement here.
