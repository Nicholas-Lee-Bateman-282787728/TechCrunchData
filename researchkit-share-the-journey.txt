This week Apple bundleda big announcement inside its long awaited Apple Watch Spring Forward event. Namely the launch ofResearchKit: aniOS software framework that lets people, currently U.S.-based only, volunteer to join medical research studies. This is arguably a lot more interesting thanexpensive, Internet-connected wrist wear.While the question of what problem the Apple Watch specifically fixes continues to preoccupy commenters, ResearchKitsraison dtreis clear: medical research needs data, and iPhones offer the promise of a populous pipeline that can get more data flowing to the scientific community.The first group ofapps developed using ResearchKit  and announced on stage atApples event are forstudies on asthma, breastcancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Parkinsons disease.ResearchKit is open source. Apple says it intends to release theframework next month, allowingresearchers to contribute to specific activity modules, such asmemory or gait testing within the framework,and share them with the global research community to advancedisease research.This is not just about leveraging iOS deviceconnectivity as an alternative to administering tedious and time-consuming paper-based studies. But also usingspecific sensinghardware that people already have in their pocketas a diagnostic testing tool  be it data inputted viathe touchscreen, or viameasurementsfrom the accelerometer (for instance to test physical gait stability) or even the microphone (as way to gauge lung capacity).The consistency of iOShardware(when compared to the far more diverse Android ecosystem) is likely to be helpful in a research scenario  certainly to some types of studies that rely on taking measurements from mobile device sensing hardware. ResearchKit apps work oniPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and thelatest generation of iPod touch devices.Studies can also be extended beyond iOS hardware via gathering data from third party health-monitoring wearables and other devices that are connected to Apples ecosystem via its HealthKit framework. (Apples own Health app was already taking a granular approach to personal medical data, withsome sixty types of health data contained in its repository.)The big promise of ResearchKitis scale, given that research studies will havethe chance to reach more people than they might otherwise, withiOS users runninginto the multimillions globally.iOS apps already help millions of customers track and improve their health. With hundreds ofmillions of iPhones in use around the world, we saw an opportunity for Apple to have an evengreater impact by empowering people to participate in and contribute to medical research, said JeffWilliams, Apples SVPof operations, in a statement at the launch. ResearchKit gives the scientific communityaccess to a diverse, global population and more ways to collect data than ever before.Theapp format also minimizes obstacles to participation in research studies, compared to, say, asking participants to submit information viapaper forms. Studies delivered via appscan alsoutilize established mobiletools, such aspush notifications, to maintain engagement from participants  so might be able to run for longer, orpull in more consistentdata (in theory).Early signs are promising for ResearchKit uptake, althoughit will be interesting to see what happens with apps that are launched outside the halo of an Apple product announcement. And oncemore studiesare live competing for participants.After six hours we have 7406 people enrolled in our Parkinson's study. Largest one ever before was 1700 people. #ResearchKit John Wilbanks (@wilbanks) March 10, 2015Signing up to a ResearchKit study is done with adigital signature, viaa finger on the touchscreen.And researchers can use the ResearchKit framework topresent what Apple describes as an interactive informed consent process.Concerns about this process have already been raised  given that theres nothing to stop minorslying about their age, for instance, in order to sign up to studies without gaining parental consent (as The Verge notes theres no age verification as yet, albeit thats something that could be added in).But this is exactly the sort of balancing act that ResearchKit apps will have to strike: increasing participation in medical research by mobile meansinevitably requires some loosening of controls over how participants join a study, since they are not attending a clinic in person. However for the data to be meaningful  and ethical  some checks and balances are obviously needed.(Its worth noting that Apple has updated its developer guidelines since the launch of ResearchKit, to specifythat developers conducting human research must comply with applicable laws for each territorythe app is made available, and must obtain consent from participants (or from parents or guardians in the case of minors).)Users are also able to choose which studies to participate in, including sharing only partial data with a particularstudy if they wish. That element of user control may also help increase participation.When it comes to privacy, Apple has emphasizedit is not itself party to any of the data being shared. Thats a key point, given that medical data is pretty much the most sensitive category of personal data there is. But again concerns have been raised about how rigorously ResearchKit data is being anonymized, and where it might end up.Sage Bionetworks, which has made several of the early ResearchKit apps and is anonymizing the data before sending it on to theresearch institutions involved in the first group of studies, told The Vergewe cant promise perfect anonymity, adding:The biggest risk in these studies is to your privacy; were going to de-identify it, but because were going to make it available for lots of research, there exists a chance that someone could re-identify you.Thats the sort of caveat weve come to expect from digital services handling and sharing userdata. The issue hereis the data in question is both extremely sensitive and intended to be widely shared for research purposes  amping up the risks if it can indeed be de-anonymized.The firstbreast cancer ResearchKit app, called Share The Journey, is focused on studying post-treatment women to identify follow onsymptoms and their effects onwomens lives.Judy Salerno, CEO of breast cancer charity Susan G. Komen, which is one of the not-for-profitorganizationssupporting the Share The Journey app, isunequivocal in her enthusiasm forResearchKit  and what she describes as an enormous opportunity for women and for science.In clinical trials recruitment is always an issue. But this is an opportunity to get out of the lab, get away from the checklist paper surveys, and bring research to the patient and make it true person-centered research, truly an opportunity to really change the way we think about the research environment, she tells TechCrunch.We knew that this was an opportunity, not only for research but for women too to understand their own journey after breast cancer treatment. Its so often that women who have gone through breast cancer treatment are so happy to just be alive that they really dont report the symptoms that can have a real impact on quality of life. For many, many years.So this is an opportunity to give voice to those symptoms, those things that people endure often for a lifetime, and to create a community around it and an opportunity for us to understand it from a scientific point of view, so it can make a real difference  not only in individuals lives, but in our understanding and potential treatment of these post-treatment effects.In the first hour after the app was announced on stage by Apple,Salerno says a few thousand people enrolled forthe breast cancer study. Bydinnertime that same evening the number had increased to around7,000.We are going to do everything we can as the worlds largest breast cancer organization to push this out, to keep people engaged in this opportunity. So this is going out on many different platforms with the four breast cancer organizations who are part of this. So its an incredible opportunity, she adds.Its a huge leap forward to moving from anecdote to science and from science to solutions for women who have had post-treatmentissues with breast cancer which is incredibly common, all too common.On the question of population bias,another early criticism of the ResearchKit initiative, given that studies are necessarily limited to owners of iOS devices, Salerno suggested similar initiatives will arrive onother platforms over time. And specifically as regards the For The Journey app, she confirmed an Android version is in the works, although theres no release date yet.Unlike some of the other initial ResearchKit apps which feature touchscreen tap tests and gait analysis using the phones accelerometer, Share The Journey is not using iOS hardware for active testing of study participants (although daily physical measurements can be imported into the app from the Health app), so its arguablyless tied to beingdelivered by specific (iOS) hardware than some of the other initial research studies.Salernos counter argument to the population bias concern is that using a mainstream mobile platform as a research conduit can make the studymore inclusive than traditional research when it comes to reaching certain demographics.The interesting thing is when you think about the populations that are very difficult to enroll in clinical trials, people of color for example, they are very laced in to their phones, their mobile devices, so this is a way not only to create a large amount of data that can be shared easily but also to bring in a more diverse population to research studies. And thats whats so amazing about it, she says.Shealso talked uphaving a structured, open source framework for conducting medical research vs individual organizations creating their own siloedapps. Thats a key part of what she sees as transformative for medical research about the ResearchKit initiative.This is so much more robust than anything that I saw that was under development, she says. Theres a few really good apps about chronicling your journey, but this steps up the game so many more levels. And it brings it into research. Which is really amazing because  and the fact that it will be an open source database is just, I think, outstanding  in the research environment for so long we have held our information closed because people were competing for grants and for resources but now this is an opportunity to query what will potentially be a very large database with many important questions.When it comes to what Komen and the other supporting charities hope to learn from the Share The Journey research study,Salerno says its about identifying the sorts ofissues women who have survived breast cancer suffer frompost-treatment, and how particular lifestyle factors, such as the level of exercise they get, can impact on follow-on symptoms.The app itself hasalso been designed to help the women glean personal healthinsights that could be helpful even before any of the wider studys research data has beencrunched.Two things that I think are really wonderful innovations are the journal, you can keep an individual diary. And another is you can opt to have exercise prompts through the kind of technology that Apple has done so well, she says.The interesting and important thing about this is that women can participate in many different parts. All or selective parts of this app, Salernoadds. Weve set this up so that there will be studies to see whether keeping a diary or whether having exercise prompts will improve your outcome. So theres already research questions embedded in the way it was constructed.The things that we know that weve taken as anecdotes, but widely recognized anecdotes about treatment  things like chemo brain fatigue, disruptive sleep patterns  these are things that we will now be able to get a handle on into this. And whether or not these things are sustained, and what makes it better and what makes it worse.
