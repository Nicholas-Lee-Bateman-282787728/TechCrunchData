We demystified it last month, butFacebooks $18 billion acquisition of WhatsAppshould begin tomake more sense to people today after the company announced that its Messenger service will become a platform for third parties  as TechCrunch first reported last week.The Messenger Platform will allowdevelopers to deeplink their apps into Messenger, and it will alsobecomea communications channel for businesses and customers. These moves arentahuge surprise  theyve been pioneered by Line and WeChat in Asia for years, and Facebooks head of Messenger, David Marcus, gave plenty of hints in an interview with Wired last year. But, while the tech industry chews onthe immediate implications, the path for WhatsApp is clearer than ever.If Facebook is a platform (which it now is), then WhatsApp will continue to be a communications utility. WhatsApps simplicity is the yin to the yang of Messengers busy platform.Facebook wants to reinvent how you interact with businesses  notifications/communications via Messenger not email pic.twitter.com/QemAhdgmx0 Jon Russell (@jonrussell) March 25, 2015No ads, nogames, and no gimmicks has long been the ethosfor WhatsApps founders, who instead stickto the business of connecting people.Initially that was viafree messages WhatsApp has eclipsed SMS in volume  and now it includes voice calls, which are slowly rolling out on Android devices first.A note from WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton,via Sequoia CapitalIf Facebook didnt have Messenger  or WhatsApp had remained independent  therewould bepressure to introduce games, business-consumer messaging or other features that aremoney spinners in Asia and way more lucrative than WhatsApps $1 per year subscription. (Though, for what its worth, Ive not paid a cent for my three years using it.)However, with Messenger adopting the platform approach and offering a more interactive experience, WhatsApp can be its antithesisandfocus onbasic communication.Theres an argument that Facebook will bring WhatsApp under the Messenger Platform umbrella over time, which iseasy to saywhen you consider that the service has 700 million monthly active users. But theres likely a vast overlap between that user base and the 600 million that Facebook says use Messenger; duplicating features across the two would make no sense.Theres also a strong case to offer a simplified chat app option.WhatsApps core strength is its ease of use. There needs to be a channel forusers like my mum who dont want bells and whistles,or those using low-enddevices or spotty mobile internet connections.Yes, WhatsApp may not make the kind of revenue per user asMessenger if it stays simple, but Im willing to bet that Facebook is happier to have it as a differentiated experience that keeps non-Messenger users inside the Facebook ecosystem in some form. Thats better than losingthem toa rival service. Besides, more subtle monetization options may be forthcoming for WhatsApp in the future.Update: WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton told a panel at Facebooks F8 group that [Messenger] Platform is not top-of-mind for us. WhatsApp is focused on product development, he added.
