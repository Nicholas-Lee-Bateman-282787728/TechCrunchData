AOL.com is getting a new look.Unless youre a regular visitor, the changes might not seem all that dramatic, but Maureen Sullivan, President of AOL.com and the companys lifestyle brands, told me that the site has been revamped to optimize for the mobile experience, and to put video front-and-center.In addition, the redesign reflects a new curation process, with Sullivans team hand-picking from different editorial modules. (AOL owns TechCrunch, and yes, apparently there will be a TechCrunch module.) She emphasized a no feeds approach, meaning that all the articles and videos will either be chosen by human beings or, over time, personalized to a visitors interests.The whole idea of AOL.com might seem kind of quaint, and even less relevant as social media becomes an ever-larger driver of Internet traffic. (Theres also the question of what the pending Verizon acquisition of AOL will mean for AOLs content business.)However, the sites traffic is actually growing, according to comScore  between June 2014 and April of this year, unique visitors went up 20.6 percent, to 31.3 million. Mobile is up 79.5 percent, while video views are up 93.8 percent. And that the average age of an AOL.com visitor is also creeping downward, down to 48.1 years old from 49.8 a year ago.As for the growth of social media, Sullivan acknowledged that in the past, the site didnt have much to offer: Since AOL.com was just linking to articles elsewhere, We didnt have anything to link to. Thats changed, however, now that its hosting videos and articles, both from AOL-owned properties and from partners like Cond Nast and NBCUniversal.For now, at least, users can choose to opt-in to the new design, or to stick with the old one.
