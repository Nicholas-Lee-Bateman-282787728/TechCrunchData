Yep, ads are going to be a big topic at Disrupt New York.Weve already announced speakers from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and AdBlock Plus, but well also be joined by Sridhar Ramaswamy, Googles vice president of ads and commerce.Despite the transition to mobile, Google remains the big name in online advertising  in fact, a strong earnings report in February sent its stock skyrocketing and (briefly) made its parent company Alphabet the most valuable company in the world.Of course, the mobile transition is still very much underway, and Google is facing growing competition from Facebook and others. So Ramaswamy can both look back at how Google has shifted its focus over the past few years to mobile, while also talking about how its strategy will evolve.Disrupt will take place from May 9 to 11 in Brooklyn.
