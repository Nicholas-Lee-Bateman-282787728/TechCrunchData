Theres probably a candidate for you.Ultimately, said founder Hunter Scarborough, the system will allow users to submit their own votes to aggregated polls, a feature that will allow for more interesting and precise information for voters and politicians.The platform we developed only recently became possible. Thanks to new open data initiatives, we now have access to up-to-the-minute political data, said Scarborough. This allows us to take an unbiased numbers-based approach that other political tools lack.
