Uber ison course to make its first public acquisition with San Jose-based mappingtech startupdeCarta in its headlights.DeCarta providesa range of location and map services, including in-map search, location APIs, turn-by-turn navigation and more.A deal to buy the startup was first reported by Mashable, but Uber has confirmed that it is near to closing an undiscloseddeal.An Uber representative told TechCrunch thatthe acquisition will helpfine-tune the companys services:A lot of the functionality that makes the Uber app so reliable, affordable and seamless is based on mapping technologies. With the acquisition of deCarta, we will continue to fine-tune our products and services that rely on maps  for example UberPOOL, the way we compute ETAs, and others  and make the Uber experience even better for our users.There might justbe more to it too.Aside from being Ubers first public acquisition  a fact that is surprising when you consider the companys$40 billion valuation and the billions upon billions that it has raised from investors  the deal isnotable because it could havethe potential to lessen Ubers reliance on Google, and Google Maps in particular.Google is an investorin Uber  courtesy of its largest investment ever  but the two companies are believed to have a fairly tense relationship. That was particularly evident last month whenwe reportedthat Uber hadopenedarobotics research facility in Pittsburgh aimed at developing self-driving cars  yes, the very same concept that Google has been working on for some time. (Added to that, therehave been unsubstantiated rumors that Google is developing its own Uber rival.)Beyond just making vehicles,Uber is using its mountains of cash to buildall the technologies for its driver-less cars itself,as we reported:Uber will be developing the core technology, the vehicles, and associated infrastructure at this Pittsburgh facility, according to sources. They have already hired a number of employees and made moves to outfit them with software, including a multi-hundred-thousand dollar investment in third-party engineering workstations.Given that backdrop, buyinga company in the mapsspace makes absolute sense, and would provide both long- and short-term value to its business.DeCarta, which was founded in 1996 and raised over $55 million in funding, willbecome a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber that continues to work with customers. Thirty of the companys 40 staff, including CEO and President Kim Fennell, will transition over following completion of the acquisition.Note: The original version of this article has been updateafter Uber told us that this is not its first acquisition. CEO Travis Kalanick toldthe audience at our Disrupt event in September 2014 that the companyhad not made any acquisitionsthe company did complete an acquihire in Amsterdam in December, but it seems that there is one other.
