Spontaneous mobile experiences should be as effortlessas possible, and the processof navigating the app store to download a companys native app can often missa users attention span.So goes the thinking with Wrap, whichfocuses on helping companies create highly interactive bite-sized mobile web experiences for its users to engagewith.The companyannounced Thursday that it had raised a $12.7 million Series B round of funding, led byRaine Capital and ProSieben with participation from Christopher Crain of Crain Communications, Dream Incubator, FF Angel LLC, Salesforce Ventures and Transmedia Capital.The company has raised $18.7 million to date.With this new round of funding, well be able to optimize our product features, grow the team and expand our go-to market strategy, Wrap CEO and founder Eric Greenberg said in a press release.

Wrap offers a platform where mobile advertisers can build these bite-size web apps andgive users access to more interactivecontent.Greenberg sees these new tools as a clear contribution to what he believes isWraps larger goal, democratizing the web.If its inexpensive and simple to create an interactive user experience, and that user experience is compelling, then it will make sense that a lot of users will want to take part, Greenberg told TechCrunch.Accessibility is key to carrying out this mission. Users can create interactive brand experiences through Wrap in a few hours or even just a matter of minutes using the template-heavy creator, without ever touching a line of code.The potential for Wraps web app creator to alter mobile user experiences is enormous. I chatted with Greenberg about how I had just been to a music festival where I was instructedto download a native event app to see basic detail like a performance schedule and maps. In situations like these, Wrap offers organizations the opportunity to simply drop a link into a confirmation email and create a more palatable experience forusers, all without having to hire a full team dedicated to developing an app that will likely only be used for a few hours at most.Wrapsservicehas a tiered pricing structure that starts at $100 a month for small businesses and builds to monthly payments of several thousands of dollars for larger corporations. In addition, the companywill also be providing free accounts to users creatingnon-commercial content with the app.
