Elon Musk has warned us about robots taking over with the help of AI. Hes even donated money to make sure that it doesnt happen. However, it sure does seem like Tesla relies on robots quite a bit, even if theyre not being primed to turn the company into Skynet. At one point this year Musk referred to AI as summoning the demons. He says its still inevitable, though.Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 3, 2014Musk posted a photo of a new Tesla production line and there were no humans to be seen. I mean, theyre most certainly in the background making sure the robots dont start making machine guns or something, Im sure. Per his caption, there are 542 robots here with 15 running simultaneously. Im sure that once Tesla spins up a bunch of these lines, shooting out cars will keep getting easier and faster. Bringing up Tesla Production Line 2. 542 robots in total with 15 operating simultaneously at the central assembly point. And people wonder why I'm worried about the robocalypse A photo posted by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Aug 29, 2015 at 2:58pm PDTThats a lot of robots. For good, though. Not the evil robocalypse that Musk mentions, of course. If they were to be like hacked and unleashed on the world they might be able to do some serious cataclysmic damage Im sure we have nothing to worry about.The snaky robot thing a few weeks ago freaked some people out, but dont worrythey wont come knocking on your door trying to sell you a TeslaYet.
