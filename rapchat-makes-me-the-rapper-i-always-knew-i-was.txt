We covered Rapchat a little bit earlier this year, andI finally decided it was time to take it for a spin. I know Ive got sweet rapping skills, and I know when its time to lay a sick beat and spit some fire, so thats why Im doing this in-depth review of Rapchat.Rapchat is an app that lets you pick a beat from a library, rap over the beat and easily share it internally on Rapchat. People can then comment on your raps and like them, and you can try getting them to trend on the charts. You can also easily share your songs on SoundCloud or Twitter, or send a link to anyone.Watch this full video of my breakdown of Rapchat.Rapchat is a really fun app. There are so many beats to pick from, and if you like rapping and just doing whatever you want, its not a bad app to play with. You can view a couple of the full raps that I made here, here and hereto get a taste of the kind of raps that youll have to go up against.Ill probably get some hate formy sweet sweet raps but thats fine because you can hate the playa, but you can never hate the game.
