Tesla and Radio Flyer  yep, the company best known for the little red wagon thatparents all over the U.S. use to drag their kids around their neighborhoods are about to launch a little electric Model S for kids.
The $499 Model S for Kids is now available for pre-orderand is scheduled to ship in May.Like any good Tesla, the Model S for Kids is obviously powered by batteries. The standard model comes with a 140 Wh lithium-ion battery pack and if you want to splurge, you can also pay an extra $50 for a 190 Wh battery pack that promises 50 percent more playtime.The maximum speed is set to 6 mph, but parents can limit it to 3 mph, too. Radio Flyer promises the Model S will have working headlights, a sound system and a spacious interior (assuming you are between 3-8 and weigh under 81 lb).It wouldnt be a Tesla if you didnt have a few options to personalize the car, too. Your choice of colors includes Midnight Silver Metallic, Deep Blue Metallic, and Red Multi-Coat, for example. You can upgrade to Silver Turbine Wheels for an extra $15, too. Radio Flyer is also selling $15 Tesla-branded license plates and a $25 parking sign, as well as a $50 indoor car cover. Add all of that together and you quickly end up paying about $800.via: electrekand The Verge
