Have you ever been riding in an Uberand become suddenly overtaken by the immediate need for a new Android tablet or aDell Latitude E6420?Yeah, me neither.But that didtstopan enterprising Uber driver from peddling his wares to me during a recent ride. I was presented with a laminated sales sheet for multiple electronics ranging from a refurbished iPhone to an electronic guitar.And the best part? I could even get these electronics delivered at a later date. For free!I am of two minds about this.On one hand, there is definitely potential inmonetizing the backseat experience in Uber and Lyft rides, just as taxis have been doing for the last decade.On the other hand, Uber and Lyft, please just startpaying your drivers a livingwage.
