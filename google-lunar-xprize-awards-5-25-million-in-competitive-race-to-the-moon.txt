Theyarean optional reward, designed torecognize advanced progress in each teamsspacecraft.The United States, Russia and China have been the only countries so far with the ability to compete in the space race since the first unmanned moon landing in 1959. However, technological advancements and private endeavors havedramatically reduced the cost of going to the moon from billions to meremillions of dollars.This helps Bangalore-based Team Indus compete against billionaire-backedMoon Express in the Xprize space race. Both teams received $1 million in the Landing category of the Milestone Prizes.We believe that we do our best work when we compete and one of the critical elements of any XPRIZE is engaging the competitive spirit that we all feel.

Just as the NFL playoffs narrowed fans focus on the road to this weeks Super Bowl, the Milestone Prizes allow the public to have a routing interest in the competition and know which teams to follow.Teams that dont win the Grand or Second Place prize will be able to keep their Milestone winnings. However the prize money will be deducted from the $30 total if they do win the Grand or Second Place prize.Each team will be awarded these Milestone Prizes at a private event tonight hosted by XPRIZE and Google at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.
