Renting an apartment sucks.In the fifteen years Ive lived in New York Ive moved about eight times. And it was always a hassle.The application process; the fear of not knowing whether Id be accepted by the landlords (NYC living is cutthroat); the inability to square my expectations of the palace in the sky I wanted with the reality of the hovel I knew Id eventually be living in it all conspired to make life far more stressful than it needed to be.If youve ever rented a place, then Im sure you know exactly what Im talking about.Well, folks now theres a solution for all of us.HomeMe, launching today in the app store, is a new mobile app that flips the script on the rental market.Co-foundedserial entrepreneur and executive heavyweight Mark Douglas  a co-founder of the company who previously served as the chief technology officer of eHarmony and the Rubicon Project; was one of the founding members of the Oracle Applications Division; and is also the current chief executive of the hundred-million dollar per-year ad-tech gorilla SteelHouse (dude is baller)  HomeMe allows you to enter your information and then only shows you apartments that youre pre-qualified to rent.Whats more its free for renters.Its a genius idea, and frankly, Im not sure why anyone hasnt done it before.The app prompts you to enter information so that it can review your financial  and rental history. Its the usual things like annual income, credit rating, background and recent rental history, then it cross-references that with the criteria of the property listings the company has on offer. The app then only matches renters with the listings that theyre actually able to rent.Unfortunately for all you East and West Coast would-be apartment hunters, the Los Angeles based company is only offering its services in Texas: initially in Dallas and Houston with Austin not far behind.But as soon as this thing hits the coasts, I really dont think theres anything that could stop this appfrom beinga huge hit.Im not even looking to move and Im tempted to play around on it to see just what I can get.And lest you doubters start in with criticisms about the ability of a hardened, ex-Oracle techie to make a dent in the wild world of residential real estate, you should know that Douglas co-founder is a longtime real estate professional.Lindsey Holland, whos Douglas co-founder, previously worked at American Campus Communities, which builds, develops, and manages residential housing for colleges and universities. While there, she oversaw operations for student housing developments including a $350 million student housing project.HomeMe is making the rental process faster and more convenient for renters and apartment management companies by allowing renters to easily browse listings, book appointments and reserve an apartment that they are approved to rent from their mobile phone, said Douglas, in a statement. Weve equipped the app with a real-time database of available apartments that will only include pre-approved listings for renters.
