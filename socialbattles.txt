Andre and Sandro De Moraes must really like to see people compete.The brothers previously created GoldMic, a now-defunct social network for hip hop battles. Now theyve launched a new iOS app called SocialBattles, where users compete to post the most popular photos.To start a battle, users either challenge each other to a 1-on-1 battle or post a photo with an open call for challengers. Then any other user can vote on the photo they like the most. There are also world hashtag rankings that show you the users withthe most popular photos for, you guessed it, a given hashtag.Itall sounds pretty simple, but thats kind of the point  when I met with Sandro De Moraes before he launched the app, he said the classic mistake that he and his brother made with GoldMic was focusing on other areas instead of the core. With SocialBattles, theyre trying to hook competitive users with a straightforward mechanic.We wanted to give some people an alternative to just Instagram  certain users that want to differentiate themselves and stand out from pack, he said.For now, De Moraes said hes more focused on seeing what users will do with the app than on monetization. But whenthe brothers decide to make money, theyprobably wont go with ads  De Moraes told me, I think ads just degrade the user experience.SocialBattles Demo Video from Sandro on Vimeo.
