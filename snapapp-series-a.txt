Content marketing startup SnapApp has raised $12 million in Series A funding.The Boston-based company offers online tools for building calculators, quizzes, infographics, interactive videos and other types of interactive content. Marketers, particularly marketers trying to sell to other business, can then use that content to connect with potential customers.Interactive content is the future of marketing because the intrinsic nature of interactive is users engaging with the content, CEO Seth Lieberman said via email. That interactivity enables marketers to better educate and guide a prospect on their journey while at the same time collect phenomenal business intelligence about the challenges and problems a future customer faces.SnapApp customers include Oracle, Cisco and EMC.
