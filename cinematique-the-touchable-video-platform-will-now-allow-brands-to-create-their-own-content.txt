Aftermore than two years of restricting content creation to their in-house team, Cinematique,the touchable video platform, isreleasing a beta version of a cloud-based Editor so brands can create their own interactivevideo content.As a refresher, Cinematique is a platform that overlays interactive areason top of video content, whichcan either be used for e-commerce or creative purposes. Users can then watch the video and interact with these dots to generate various types of responses.For example, a company can create touchable video by droppingpins oneach article of clothing shown in a video of a photo shoot.Users can then touch these pinned items while the video plays, and when its finished are providedinformation about each item as well asa link to purchase it.Cinematique then allows these videos to be embedded across the web (like at the bottom of this post), or on mobile devices via the companys SDK.Interestingly, the company is still seeing more views on desktop platforms, with about a 60/40 percent split between desktop and mobile, respectively.The company has forged deals with impressive fashion companiesincludingCond Nast, Nordstrom, and Louis Vuitton.These brands will be getting access now to the beta platform,with a public launch towards the end of the quarter. Anyone else canapply for the beta now, through the companys Innovative Partners Program.
