If youre looking for a more interactive experience from your favorite TV shows, a company called Cognitive Networks is working to make it happen.Cognitive Networks was founded in 2008 and we last wrote about it back in 2013, after the company announced its partnership with LG. When I ran into President Zeev Neumeier tonight at CESin Las Vegas, he told me that the technology is now embedded with most models of LG TVs available today.As Neumeier explained it to me, his team has developed automatic content recognition (ACR) that looks at the picture on your TV and uses that data to identify exactly what youre watching. That, in turn, enables a content provider or advertiser to add interactive overlays to the TV screen itself, triggered by whats onscreen at the moment  say, a poll thats relevant to a scene in a show or a coupon thats tied to an ad.At CES, Cognitive Networks showed off Showtime programming with those overlays  and yes, Showtime is actually a live partner. This should help media companies engage with viewers and gather valuable data, and it could make the experience more fun for at least some TV watchers. (To be clear, Neumeier emphasized that the company is focused on the TV-recognition technology; it leaves the actual content of the overlays up to its partners and customers.)In addition to giving me a quick demo, Neumeier discussed the competitive landscape. I was particularly curious about his view on Shazams moves into TV  granted, Shazam uses your smartphone to identify TV content while Cognitives technology works through your TV itself, but arent they both competing for the same viewers attention?Neumeier acknowledged that first screen and second screen ACR initially look like theyre related, but he said that theyre pretty different, because a second-screen app like Shazam is best for reaching users who are already engaged, while a first-screen experience like Cognitive can potentially reach a more casual viewer. (To be clear, users opt-in to Cognitives overlays, too  youre not going to see polls start popping up without your approval.) He added that these experiences kind of feed each other, and they could even work together, with a button on your TV sending a coupon to an app to your phone.All power to Shazam, he added.And Neumeier argued Cognitive has a very different technology compared tocompanies that use visual fingerprints in order to identify copyright infringement online.This is a business thats fiendishly difficult to scale, he said. Thats because Cognitive isnt just examining content on the web, but also processing identification requests from a number of TVs simultaneously.Another recent development: The company raised a $14.5 million Series B from Hearst Ventures and others.
