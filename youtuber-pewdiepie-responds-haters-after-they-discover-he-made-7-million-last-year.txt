Felix Kjellberg aka PewDiePie is the king of the YouTubers. Hes a YouTube star with 9 billion views and Expressen, a Swedish newspaper, estimated that he made $7 million last year on advertising, a feat that is no longer an outlier in the burgeoning world of online stardom.In the video Kjellberg described his 5 year career as a YouTube star whose entire oeuvre is dedicated to playing video games while others watch. His videos get over 5 million views per episode.It is unsurprising that Kjellberg is doing so well. By getting in early and grabbing the valuable pre-teen-teen online market he and his team can easily grab millions of bored iPad browsers every day. It will be fascinating to see where folks like PewDiePie end up  whether the mainstream media will attempt to pre-empt or consume them when broadcast and movie moguls realize hot dog salesmen from Sweden are eating their lunch.
