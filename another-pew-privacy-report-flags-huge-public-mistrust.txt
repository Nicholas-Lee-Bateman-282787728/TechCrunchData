The disconnect between Americancitizens desire forprivacy and the actions of the U.S. government  and big technology companies  continues.A new survey bythePew ResearchCenterunderlines the extent of the mistrust between U.S. citizens, government institutions and tech services  with less than a third(31 per cent) of American adultsexpressing confidence in governments ability to safeguard their data. This is the third in a series of privacy-focused studies conducted by Pew in the wakeof the 2013 Snowden revelations of government agencysurveillance programs.For all of the eleven entities asked about in the survey from government agencies to credit card companies to social media sitesonly a small minority said they are very confident that the records maintained by these organizations will remain private and secure, notes Pew.Another finding from the survey: amajority (65 per cent) of Americans do not believe there areadequate limits on what telephone and Internet data the government can collect as part of anti-terrorism effortsvsjust under a third (31 per cent) who dobelieve there are appropriate limits on the kinds of data gathered for these programs.Pew notes that respondents who are more aware ofgovernment online surveillance programsare considerably more likely to believe adequate safeguards are not in place; 74per centof those who have heard a lot about these programs say limits are not adequate vs62 per cent who have heard only a little about the monitoring programs.The survey also foundthat most Americans wantlimits on the length of time that records of their online activity can be retained. A majority (50 per cent) of the adults surveyed by Pew for the research believe that online advertisers who place ads on the websites they visit should not save records or archives of their activity for any length of time.Sothose folks must bereally unhappy about, for instance, the sophisticated tracking infrastructure (deployed by companies such asTCs current parent AOL) when they click to accept cookies during a web browsing session  in order to stalkthem around the Internet and across their devices with targetedadvertising.A sizable minority (44 per cent) of U.S. adultsalso believe that online video sites should not retain records of their activity; and a full 40 per cent arent at all happy about Googles business model  believing that search engine providers shouldnt retain information about their activity.Those folks should really think about switching their browsing activity toDuckDuckGo  if they havent already.According to Pew, just nine per cent of Americans say they feel they have a lot of control over how much information is collected about them and how it is used. The largestproportions  of more thana third apiece  feel they havesome control or not much control. Which, given how obfuscated the tracking tech that powers the online ad industry generally is, is really not at all surprising.A full 13 per cent of Pews respondents said theyfeel they personally have no control at all over the way their data is gathered and used.No control at all.If that doesnt sound like a system with some seriously large cracks in it, I dont know what would.That sense of consumer powerlessness about being stalked online doubtless exacerbated by the opacity of commercial ad-fueled trackinginfrastructure  perhaps explains why so few Americans are changing their behavior to avoid digitaltracking. Bottom line: how do you beat an apparently infinitelytentacleddata-sucking octopus thatyou also cant see?Just seven per cent of respondents reported having made changes to their Internet or cell phone to avoid having their activities tracked or noticed in recent months, according to Pew. That said,aprior Pew privacy survey found that almost a third of Americans hadchanged some of theirbehaviorand use of technology in the wake of disclosures triggeredby NSA whistleblower Edward Snowdento try to avoid online government surveillance programs.Which perhaps suggestsAmericans are more motivated to evade government privacy intrusionsthan corporate overreach in this space.Thing is, the Snowden documents have shown governments are systematically tappinginto commercialInternet services to harvest vast repositories of citizens data. So really, when it comes to the military industrialsurveillance complex,all these data-harvesting tentacles are ultimately being plugging into the same centralized surveillance infrastructure.So yeah, no control at all.
