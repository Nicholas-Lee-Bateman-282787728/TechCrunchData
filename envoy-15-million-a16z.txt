There are companies that raise $15 million, and then there are companies that raise $15 million.Envoy, the startup behind an iPad app designed tokill the lobby sign-in book  as we reported last year when it landed $1.5 million  is perhaps not one that youd associate with such fundraising. But the San Francisco-based company has indeed landed $15 million, which was provided by bit-hitting investment firm Andreessen Horowitz(A16z).So how is it that a 15-person company that is disrupting the visitor registration system can land a seeming truckload of cash?Well, as youd expect when A16z is involved, theres a lot of potential bubbling under the surface. But lets start with where Envoy is now.Founded last year by LarryGadea, a former engineer with Google and Twitter, Envoy digitizes the lobby registration process when people visit a company. Forget pen, paper or digital systems, Envoy is a white-label service that lets visitor sign-up via an iPad app  the basic $99 service includesunlimited sign-in, NDA signing, photos, badge printing and SMS and email notification. Ahigher tier ($249 or $499) includes pre-registration, a security desk and custom badges.The company was close to profitable with 250 customers back in September when it raised that $1.5 million. Now, that figure has surpassed 1,000, of which  Gadea told TechCrunch  50 percent are based outside of California and 50 percent are not in the tech space. Rakuten just movedHQ in Tokyo and it installed Envoy at its new home.Ive always been nervous, Gadea told me. I hoped were not just solving aSan Francisco problem but [adoption] has been growing like crazy in all possible industries.Most impressive, Envoy has only lost 10-20 customers, Gadea said, but each time thats been down to bankruptcy or acquisition-led reasons. (So, install Envoy and your company has a chance of getting acquired or perhaps sinking!)So Envoy is bouncing along well  new customer education is a key part of the challenge, Gadea said  but its raised $15 million because of the potential to push much further into the corporate and office world.Its cool to have one product, this iPad app, but Id like to see more than that, Gadea said, but at this point it isnt clear exactly what that willbe.We have an Apple Watchapp and employee app  which sends push notifications but we want to make amore generic push, he added.Gadea makes the case that, with Envoys app used across entire companies, it is just scratching the surface and could be adapted to replaceany (of the many) antiquated andnon-digital process in a work place. Be that organizing conference room bookings, alerts for package arrivals, office maps thattrack the location of staff who travel frequently, a replacement for ID card/badges, and so on.We want to be the smart office central hub for all these things that used to require manual labor, Gadea explained succinctly.A16z, as a VC, is well known for betting on the future, so it seems like an interesting match for Envoy as it pushes its business into new segments.On that note, Gadea said that he was particularly impressed with A16z partner Chris Dixon, who was involved in the round.Hewas the most aggressive, Gadea. Thats great because Iwant someone wholl give me a hard time and point out the problems that we can fix.Dixon  who has invested in drones, soylent and virtual realityis also wellknown for forward-thinking in the tech space.Right now, Envoy is operating without any direct competitors  save hastily made $0.99 apps in the App Store  and Gadea also believes that an ecosystem play will help strengthen its business and plant roots into its existing customers.Gadea said heisgoing to spend the money on hiring and developing its product, but it is also slowly expanding its business development team too. With the Rakuten deal, it has hired a representative in Japan and it also now has a rep in Singapore.
