Last week, I visited payments company Square and sat down with itsHardware Lead, Jesse Dorogusker, about much more than hardware. Dorogusker, a former director of engineering at Apple, discussed with me how the company has evolved to much more than a dongle that accepts payments.Not only has the hardware itself evolved, but the company is serving an important role other than just being the physical point of sale. Square has a full stack of software to help companies of any size, as well as a lending arm to help companies level up.Until recently, Square came to mind as something food trucks or small coffee shops used to collect payments, but as its suite of services expand, so does its clientele. Good news, especially if the company decides to go public at some point.
