If youve ever watched an Apple press event, you have likely grown accustomed to the format.Usually, Tim Cook steps out on stage and throws around some numbers, like total iPhones sold, iOS market share, retail success, etc. Then we get down into the product introductions, which start with a real-life unveiling.But before Apple gets into the nitty gritty of new features, specs, etc., the company often shows a very well-produced video of how the iPhone, or iPad or Apple TV, was made with great attention to detail and much scrutiny.In short, the videos are awesome, and often narrated by Sir Jony Ive.So weve compiled all of them in one handy place for your viewing pleasure.
