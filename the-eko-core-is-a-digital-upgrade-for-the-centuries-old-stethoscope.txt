In a few months, the stethoscope will celebrate its 200th birthday. A medical breakthrough in 1816, its still a part ofnearly every doctors visit todayandasymbol of medicine itself.Yet the stethoscope hasnt changed much in the past 200 years.No different than in the17th century, listening to a heartbeat has beena manual process that relies entirely on a doctors ear to detect irregularities.That is, until today. And its all thanks toEko Devices,aBerkeley-based startup that just became the youngest team to secure FDA clearance for a Class II medical device. Co-founders Connor Landgraf, Jason Bellet, and Tyler Crouch, all rather recent graduates of UC Berkeley, have addeda digital dimension to the centuries-old tool.Dubbed the Eko Core, their solution is an adapter that attaches to the typical stethoscope and streams the heartbeat data to the cloud, providing doctors with an entirely newlayer of information to analyze.Its incredibly challenging to hear a minute heart murmur, especially in patients with high heart rates, says Landgraf. Cardiologists say its almost like a musical ear, its something that you have to learn over five or ten years of practice.With the Eko Core, the physician can see the heartbeat in wave form on a mobile device as well as hear the sound at an amplified level. Both the visible and audible data can be recorded and easily shared between physicians and hospitals.For doctors, this takes a lot of the guesswork out of detecting murmurs, valve problems, and blockages in the arteries.And for the 70 percent ofpediatric patientswith suspected heart murmurs whoare unnecessarily referred to a cardiologist, Eko will be able to save thousands of dollars in avoidable echocardiograms.Physicians dont have confidence in their ability to use the stethoscope in a lot of situations so they frequently refer people to cardiologists when its not necessary, Landgraf says.Eko is running a pilot with Stanford Hospital, where all residents will be using the Eko Core device as a training tool. Today, thecompany is releasing the deviceto the public for$199 on its own, or $299 with a stethoscope included.Over the next few months, the team will be continuing to developan algorithm that analyzesthe data collected by all Eko devices in order to match heartbeats to conditions in real-time. Kind of like the Shazam for heartbeats, as Landgraf says doctors like to call it.Connecting patients to physicians with noninvasive tools to understand whats going on in peoples hearts is going to be really powerful, Landgraf says. Right now you can catheterize a patient to find out what the pressures are like inside of the heart, but its very invasive and inefficient.The condition-detecting feature is slated to launch in Q1 of next year, and Landgraf hints that Eko will eventually roll out additional products to give physicians a better understanding of the heart in a noninvasive manner.Since Eko was founded in 2013, the companyhasraised $2.8 million from Stanfords StartX Fund, FOUNDER.org founder Michael Baum, and the co-founders of Shazam, among others.
