Nestled betweenSilicon Valley suburbs with median multi-million dollar home prices,East PaloAlto is a 28,000-person community that canfeel like it hasbeen left by the wayside of the current tech boom. One-third of its adultresidentsdont have more than a high school diploma and its unemployment rate is about double of whattheneighboring communities see.Some of this is the result of intentional andunjust policies and practices from more than a half-century ago, that I covered in this long piece last month. They were never really acknowledged and East Palo Alto was left out of the transformations that gave way toPC companies in the 1980s and then the Internet in the 1990s and beyond.Despite this, the city has a long history of political organizing.NowasFacebooks new Frank Gehry-designed headquarters andslow-growth policies from adjacentPalo Altocontinue to put affordability pressures on the city, theres this question of how to include this historically black, and now largely Latino, community in the current boom.SamaUSA is trying to rethink workforce development for the digital age in the U.S. Its an arm of the Sama Group, which was founded by social entrepreneur Leila Janah to connect people in Sub-Saharan African and South Asian communities to basic online work.Two years ago, they started bringing their programto communities in the United States, starting with San Franciscos Bayview neighborhood. They have aprogram that teachesdigital skillslike social media marketing, how to use platforms like Elance andOdesk and job-huntingbasics like doing resumes and cover letters.Theyre starting their first 10-weekclass targeted atEast Palo Alto residents this month, in partnership withJobTrain, a non-profit thats been in the citys surroundingSan Mateo County for about 50 years.On the surface, this sounds simple. But half of the programs applicantsdont own a personal computer or laptop. Almost one-third of their applicants dont have Internet at home  in Silicon Valley of all places.When we started, we couldnt find anything that was really similar, said Tess Posner, who is the managing director of SamaUSA.There are lots of programs that reach out to and train people fromstructurally disadvantagedcommunities around the Bay Area, but they have different target demographics. YearUp, for example, trainsyoung people in their teens and twenties who might not have had access to college or four-year universities to intern at tech companies like Yelp and Salesforce. Then there are lots of youth-focused codingprojectslike East Palo Altos Streetcode Academy.SamaUSAs program spans a wider age range. Three-fourths of their applicants are currently unemployed, with most of them suffering from chronic unemployment.Three-fourths of them live in households that earn less than $24,000 a year.Without exposure, peopledontknow how to take advantage of the opportunities youseeacross the Bay Area,said Posner, who worked on workforce development in the East Bay before joining SamaUSA.At SamaUSAs other sites in the Bay Area and rural areas across the country, the non-profit says its graduates have gotten online work contractsearning about $11.94 an hour in jobs from administrative assistance to data entry.Posner says their program costs about $3,000 per student and they have a goal of training 25,000 people in online work.In order to do that, we have to buildsomething thats highly scalable, Posner said. SamaUSAs pilots havebeen funded so far by donations from JPMorgan Chase.We want to provide that bridge between our studentsand tech companies that are right there, Posner said.
