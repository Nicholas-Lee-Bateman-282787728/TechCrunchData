Were only in the first week of January, but already Southeast Asia has seen its first merger of significance.Female-focused e-commerce players Moxy, which is present in Thailand and Indonesia, and Bilna, an Indonesian startup from ex-Groupon Indonesia founders, have joined forces to take on opportunities in Southeast Asia, a growing tech region thats home to more than 600 million people.Bilna, which has raised two rounds of undisclosed funding from the likes of East Ventures, Golden Gate Ventures, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and Cyberagent Ventures, started out selling baby and toddler products but expanded to cover other family products. Moxy, meanwhile, began with a focus on fashion but widened to cover other verticals, including mom and baby.Theres no publicly disclosed valuation forthe deal or the joint entity  which will be named MoxyBilna  but the companies claim it is one of Southeast Asias largest e-commerce M&A events of its kind to date. That may be true because, to this point at least, there hasnt been massive consolidation in Southeast Asia e-commerce, but it could be a sign of things to come as bigger players like Rocket Internet-backed Lazada and Zalora  which have collectively raised over $1 billionfrom investors and Indonesias well-backed Matahari Mall, heap pressure onsmaller competitors.Thats not the angle thatJrmy Fichet, Moxys CEO and nowGroup CEO of MoxyBilna, is takingthough.Fichet explained that Moxy, which is the result of an acquisition itself, was looking at funding options to boost its presence in Indonesia last year when it came upon the idea of teaming up with Bilna. In turn, Bilna expressed an interest and todays announcement was thus the product of six months of discussions and collaboration.Rather than viewing Rocket Internet businesses, SoftBank-backed Tokopedia and others as competition, Fichet believes Moxy Bilna is furrowing its own pathand focused on women.We want to build the best e-commerce site for women, he told TechCrunch in an interview. Thats very different to others. Manyare focused on the whole population, but we have a very specific demographic in mind.Right now, MoxyBilna is presentin Indonesia and Thailand, butFichet said there are plans to move into other parts of Southeast Asia, with Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines the most likely immediate moves. Acquisitions could be a route into making those expansions.If someone built something very strong in a country, why not join forces and work together? Well be looking at [expansion options] over the coming months, Fichetsaid.More immediately though, MoxyBilna plans to integrate the two business into a single,united one,including one website, rather than keeping them standalone.
