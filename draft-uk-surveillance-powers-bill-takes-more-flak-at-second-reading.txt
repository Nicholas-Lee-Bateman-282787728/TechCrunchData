Proposed new U.K.surveillance powers aregetting asecond reading in parliament today, as the government seeks to update and extend the lawin this area before the end of the year.The Investigatory Powers bill has been dubbed a Snoopers Charter byprivacy and civilrights groups. It alsoreceived substantialcriticisms from the three parliamentary committees that scrutinized the first draft of the legislation.The official opposition Labour Party is taking a more nuanced  or elsestrategic  stance in its oppositionto the bill at this stage, with Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham describing the Snoopers Charter labelas a lazy characterization during todayssecond reading.Labours position is important here in partbecause the U.K.s Conservative government only has a small majority, but also because the governmentis seeking to pass complex and lengthy legislation within a relatively shortparliamentary timetable  and the quickest way to do that would be to gain consensus from opposition MPs (not to mention wholesale supportfromthe public).The simple fact is, Britain needs a new law in this area, Burnham told parliament. Outright opposition, which some are proposing risks sinking the Bill and leaving interim laws in place. To go along with that would be to abdicate our responsibility to the police, security services and more importantly the public and I am not prepared to do that.However, he also confirmed the Labourparty will not be voting forthe billin its current form. It will insteadabstain on the second reading vote. This follows remarks he madeyesterday, when he said thepartywants to see substantial changes to the IP bill and would prefer to see the legislative timetable extend into 2017 rather than a bad bill being rushed through this year.In his speech today Burnham noted: Of the 122 recommendations in the three [committee] reports the government has reflected less than half of them in this revised bill. And I say to the Home Secretary she will need to be prepared to listen more and make further significant changes to her bill if she is to achieve her goal of getting it onto the statute book by December.He wenton todetail six specific areas where Labourwants to see amendments or other action, namely:Given the seriousness of these concerns people have questioned why we are not votingagainst the government. The simple answer is we need new legislation. But this bill isnt yet good enough  and that is why we have set the tests that we have. Simply to block this legislation would in my view be irresponsible. It would lead the police and security services in limbo, added Burnham.However there is no blank check for the government. We will not be voting for this bill because it is so way from being good enough. And if the government fails to respond adequately to the concerns I have raised then I give notice to them today that we will withdraw our support for the timetabling of this bill I think the public interest lies in getting this right  and not sacrificing quality to meet the deadline.Home Secretary Theresa May reiterated the governments claim that it has made a swathe of amendments to the draft bill, taking on board committee recommendations to, for example, reduce the time when an urgent warrant that is authorized by the Secretary of State must be reviewed by a judicial commissioner from a period of five days to three.In her opening remarks shealso claimed privacy protections are now hardwired into the bill a phrasing Burnham took issue with, arguing the government needsto do far more to achieve a balance between security and privacy considerations.We all share an interest in maximising bothour individual privacy and our collective security.As a House ofCommons, our goal should be to give people both, he argued.Also speaking up for more to be done to bolsterprivacy safeguards in the legislation wasDominic Grieve, chair of the ISC, who noted that thegovernment had responded to only nine of its 22 recommendations.We were disappointed that the bill doesnt include a clear statement on overarching privacy protection, said Grieve. We accept the bill has safeguards but they do come across as slightly piecemeal so we think its a missed opportunity  a missed opportunity above all of providing that level of public reassurance, even if the practical consequence wouldnt make a vast amount of difference.The committeehad been seeking toimprove the legislation by trying to provide greater clarity, transparency and increased safeguards as a way to bolster public trust in the bill, he added.The fact a particular power may never to our knowledge have been misused doesnt mean we should disregard creating transparent safeguards for its use  if this can be done without interfering with operational capability. We also have to accept the possibility that times might change and standards slip. Its important we should provide safeguards against such slippage.Grieve added that another missed opportunity with the current bill is the fact that it does not gather all the investigatory powers into one place.The government has chosen to leave some powers elsewhere. We thought it would have been helpful to put them all in this bill, he said.Burnhamsaida keypart of Labours concerns with the legislation as it is currently drafted isthe risk of misuse of the powers by state agencies, going on to detail several instances where he asserted state surveillance capabilities havebeen inappropriately used in the past.In recent years, there have been revelations abouthowbereaved families, justice campaigners, environmentalcampaigners, journalists and trades unionists have all beensubject to inappropriate Police investigation, he said.Last year, a former senior police officer turned whistleblower claimed Police involvement in supplyinginformation that led to the blacklisting of construction workers. And, for those who claim these fears are exaggerated, I would refer them to the biggest unresolved case of this kind the 1972 national building-workers strike and the convictions of the 24 pickets known as the Shrewsbury 24.Responding to Burnhams point about raising thresholds for the use of powers in the bill, May pointed to the addition ofjudicial authorization as the independent check and balance the government is baking in to combat any such misuse. But he countered that the grounds for which police and security services have the ability to putforward applications for warrantsshould be as tightly defined as possible.I dont think it helps if she is proposing that they can be brought forward on the grounds of general economic well-being It opens up a much wider range of potential activities that could be subject to the most intrusive warrants, he added.During the reading, Maywas also asked by Conservative MP David Davis how long she personally spends reviewing each of the circa 2,500 warrants she is asked to review each year  aka some10 warrants perworking day.Its impossible to put a time on it because each decision differs, she said.The amount of information thats available, the type of case that wants looking at, the extent to which it may refer to a matter that has already been considered. It all varies. So the amount of time I give to each case is the amount of time necessary to make the right judgement about each case.The Scottish National Party also said it will be abstaining from todays vote, raising a raft of concerns about the current draft, including what it dubbed vague definitions, the wide-ranging scope of ICRs and the continued role of ministers in authorizing warrants (versusa system basedsolelyon judicial authorization, as is the case in the U.S. and elsewhere).
