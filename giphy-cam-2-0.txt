Giphy, the Google of GIF, has introduced an update to Giphy Cam, the app that lets users create their own shareable GIFs. The most important feature of the update comes by way of camera roll import, letting users choose photos or videos from their own existing collection of media as opposed to capturing with the Giphy Cam camera. This broadens the amount of content running through Giphy Cam. The update also brings with it the ability to trim imported videos, for smaller files, and overlay more than one filter on a single GIF. Plus, the app now lets users add text over their GIFs. Lacking its own feed, Giphy Cam aims more to be a utility  turning regular files into one of the fastest-growing forms of content out there, a GIF  as opposed to a social network in its own right. Just as Giphy aims to be a database where people can search, upload and share GIFs, Giphy Cam is meant to be the place to create your own to share elsewhere, whether through SMS or on social networks. While the new features represent the biggest-to-date change to the app, Giphy has also improved the overall quality of capture within the app, for both video and burst-mode (which captures still frames and strings them together).
