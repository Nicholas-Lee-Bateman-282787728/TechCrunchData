And now, we focus on whats really exciting: the little guys looking to make it big in the hardware game.Well be roaming the showroom floors live to find the brightest, shiniest new thing, and then well start in on the Hardware Battlefield, where gadget makers have one shot to impress a panel of all-star judges (including Yves Behar, Jenny Lawton, and Brady Forrest) and take home the Metal Man, the hardware-specific version of the Disrupt Cup.Its a fun week, and it begins now.Thanks for joining us, and use the #CESCrunch to chat with us.
