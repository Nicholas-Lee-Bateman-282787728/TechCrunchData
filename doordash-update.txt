DoorDash is unveiling new versions of its website and app today, putting each restaurants delivery experiencefront-and-center.Thats happeningthrougha new Delight score, which Head of Design Josh Abrams described as an industry-first rating  one that doesnt just reflect the general quality of the meal, or the experience of dining in the restaurants, but rather the food that arrives on your doorstep.To calculate the score, Abrams said DoorDash is looking at a number of data points, including customer feedback and restaurant popularity.The idea is to take data that DoorDash has already been collecting and boil it down to a single number that can help customerschoose the restaurant that will provide the best delivery experience. The updated DoorDash also has a new design (one thats responsive on the web, so itll adjust to your device and screen size), with the ability to sort restaurants based on price, speed and that new Delight score. And its going to start featuring food photography, with pictures taken by the DoorDash team itself.All of this comes, by the way, comes just a couple ofdays after DoorDash announced that it hasraised $127 million more(in what was reported to be a down round, with a lower valuation than its previous funding). Xu said that the back-to-back announcements, is just how the timing worked out.
