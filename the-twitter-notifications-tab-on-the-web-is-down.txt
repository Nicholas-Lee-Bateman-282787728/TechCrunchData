Michael Bolen (@MichaelBolen) December 15, 2015Anyone else having trouble with checking their notifications? Brazzell Dazzle (@YourFavDazzle) December 15, 2015Its primetime for Twitter with the CNN / Facebook Republican Debate beaming to TVs live from Vegas. Its weird using Twitter for one-way communication, so seeing your replies would be nice.For a service that only has four tabs, its quite obvious when one doesnt work. Its been down for nearly a half hour at this point.Weve reached out to Twitter for comment and will update if we hear anything.UPDATE: It appears to be back up, but we havent heard from Twitter or seen an update on Twitters status blog.UPDATE 2: A Twitter spokesperson told usA small number of users may be experiencing an issue accessing the Notifications timeline on web, iOS, and Android. Were working on a fix!UPDATE 3: A Twitter spokesperson updated the situation:This issue is now resolved.
