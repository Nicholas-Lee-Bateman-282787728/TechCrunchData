About two hours ago, I got a flurry of text messages from my family.My Instagram got hacked! one read.I cant log into Instagram! I got a notification saying Id been logged out!You too?Dont panic. A bunch of people got those alerts  and no, it wasnt a big ol mega hack.Its unclear exactly what happened, but Instagram says it wasnt the result of something malicious. Just a bug, they say  and one that should be fixed now.Carry on posting pictures of your coffee, shoes, and things perfectly centered from above.We experienced a bug that logged out some people and showed incorrect error messages.
