Get Periscope to watch our Q2 earnings prepared remarks and Q&A. We go LIVE at 2pm Pacific @TwitterIR. $TWTR https://t.co/TN3r3VLQEN Jack (@jack) July 28, 2015You cant talk about Twitter without talking about how many users it has, since its naturally compared to Facebook in almost every way. While its financial results continue to impress even the staunchest of detractors, its the lack of measurable user growth, the hockey stick if you will, is what cheeses people off about Twitter.Forget Facebooks 1.4 billion users. Why doesnt Twitter have even 500 million users? Whats stopping people from signing up? This is the next CEOs problem to tackle, no matter who it is.Twitters stock is up nearly 5 percent after-hours.
