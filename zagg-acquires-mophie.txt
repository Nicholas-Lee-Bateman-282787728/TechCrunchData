Heres a bit of breaking news for your Tuesday afternoon: ZAGG, best known for its line of Invisible Shield screen protectors, is acquiring Mophie, makers of the popular JuicePack line of smartphone battery cases.Zagg will pay $100M for Mophie up front, plus a flexible 12-month earn-out based on Mophies performance over the next year. ZAGG says they expect the deal to close within the quarter.In a world of billion-dollar software unicorns, $100M for a well-established and well-distributed brand actually seems pretty cheap. On the other hand, Mophie focuses almost entirely on USB battery packs and smartphone battery cases  and thats quickly becoming a ridiculously crowded space, with competition from everything from no-name white label batteries handed out as conference swag, to affordable-but-generally-decent newcomers like Aukey and Anker, to Apple.
