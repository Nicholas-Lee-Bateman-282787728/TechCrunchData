Legacy Republic is removing a big hurdle in its photo digitizing process  putting albums in the mail.YesVideo launched its Legacy Republic initiative back in 2014. The idea is to recruit a freelance workforce of so-called Legacy Makers who help families digitize their photos. Through digitization, the company says it can preserve memories and make it easier to share those pictures between family members, particularly when youre living in different cities or countries.However, YesVideo CEO Michael Chang said customers are often hesitant to go through the process, since it means sending the photo albums to Legacy Republics lab  not something you necessarily want to do with photos that have tremendous emotional significance.Enter the companys new Studio product, which allows Legacy Makers to do the scanning on their own, either in their own home or the customers. Why not use a regular scanner or camera? Chang said that many photos cannot be removed from their albums without damaging them, and the albums create glare that obscures the photo that youre trying to capture.Chang demonstrated Studio for me last week. Within a few minutes, hed set up the Studio, taken pictures of each page in a photo album and presented me with a beautiful digital replica. And while Chang said Studio costs hundreds of dollars to manufacture, the company will be providing it to active Legacy Makers at no charge. (Theyll need their own iPhone, though.)The key for Legacy Makers is to empower them to give cool experiences to their customers, added Brian Knapp, head of Legacy republic.
