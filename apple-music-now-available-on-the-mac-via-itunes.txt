Apple Music arrived earlier today on iOS, with the iOS 8.4 update, and now its coming to the desktop via a new version of iTunes. The launch has been going pretty well so far, with only a few hiccups including some early mic testing by Zane Lowe prior to the official launch of the 24-hour Beats 1 radio station. The update went out quickly and consistently, however, and streaming seems to have been working well from the very beginning.On the desktop, there was a much more prolonged delay before people could get their hands on the service  it started percolating out to users around 3 PM PT, which is around seven hours after it launched on mobile. The update to the desktop application includes Beats 1, as well as the redesigned Apple Music Radio service with on-demand stations, and the ability to search for and add tracks from the entire catalog of available streaming tracks, too.To get it, go to the App Store and navigate to the Updates tab, where it should show as available.
