Launching today, Trove is a platformthat letsusers customize and buy personalized, 3D-printed jewelry. Based in NYC, thecompany has raised a $640k seed round from Resolute Ventures and Uprise Ventures.Although 3D printing has started to become a viable way to manufacture products in certain industries,the technology hasnt yet become a seriousmanufacturing method for most consumer goods.This is because most parts are still printed in plastic, a material that just isnt suitable for some products (including high-end jewelry).However, some 3D printing services have begun printing jewelry made ofmetals ranging anywhere from stainless steel to 18-caret Gold.Heres how it works: A 3D printer is used to createa mold for the jewelry, which the precious metal is then poured inside of to create the piece.Printing these one-off molds allows for some serious customization. Trove, which is launching with around 30 jewelrydesigns on its platform, estimates that its customization tools allow users to turn those 30 designs into hundreds of thousands of unique pieces.While designs start at around $50 dollarsfor a piece cast in bronze, the companys gold options can quickly jumpinto the high hundreds, oreven thousands of dollars.Interestingly, the company also offers a try before you decide option, where the company will send you a free, 3-D printed plastic version of your jewelry creation. Trove explains thatthis is so users can try on jewelry for fit before having it made out of more expensive materials.Trove is powered by Shapeways, who arecurrently handling the printing and shipping of both the plastic prototype and the finished piece.Brian Park, cofounder of Trove, explained that Shapeways API made it easy for the team to focus on perfecting the customization aspect of the platform, and leave the printing to someone else.As 3D printingmatures, users will continueto look for the technologys killer feature that will really set it apart from traditional manufacturing. Jewelry customization, an expensive luxury that has been traditionally been reserved for the rich and famous, could just be that feature.
