Meet your new companion. LG designed this rolling robot to do all sorts of mundane tasks around your home. It can even play with your cat  just dont ask it to vacuum your floors. Its not that kind of household robot.About half the size of a bowling ball, the little guy can roll around your pad, control appliances or TVs and monitor your home with a built-in 8MP webcam. Its like BB-8. It even beeps and chirps.The Rolling Bot can control a TV, and LG says it can talk to home appliances. It also sports a laser pointer that the owner can control remotely through a connected camera. Because cats. Seriously. LG envisions Rolling Bot owners playing with their cats from afar, and thanks to built-in two-way audio, you can chat with the cats, too.LG isnt saying when this little bot will be released or how much it will be when it hits the market.
