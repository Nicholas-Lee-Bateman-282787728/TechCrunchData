500 Startups is continuing its quest to cover Asia after the U.S.-headquartered VC company launched a $30 million microfund for Japan.The firm first moved into Asia in 2013 with its $10 million 500 Durians fund for Southeast Asia. That recently got a $5 million to-up, while 500 Startups also has a $10 million 500 Tuktuks fund for Thailand, a $20 million fund for India,a post-accelerator program in Malaysia and it is close to opening a fund in Vietnam. Thats in addition to other funds across the world, and the firms newest global fund, which just closed at $85 million last week.The firm formerly had a joint venture in Japan,which hasthe worlds third largest economy butless than$1.5 billion in startup investments per year, and a fund wasan obvious gap.500 Startupshas made fiveover 15 investments in Japan  including translation service Gengoand ticketing company Peatix to date, but the dedicated fund will be solely focused on startups in the East Asia country so expect that number that rise sharply.The500 Startups Japan fund will be led by James Riney, who is joining the firm from games firmDeNAs VC arm, and an as yet unnamed second partner who is finishing up theircurrent job before moving over.Riney (right) with 500 Startups head Dave McClureRiney told TechCrunch that, like other 500 Startups funds, Japan will be split 50-50 between early stage investments and follow-on funding opportunities up to Series A. The company will co-invest in deals and cut $100,000-$500,000 checks, Riney said, although it may go to $1 million in some cases.As for areas of interest: hesaid the fund is vertical agnostic but biotech, Saas, SMB, virtual and healthcare are some areas hed like to explore.Id be expecting the fund to be called 500 Samurai, 500 Sashimi, or similar, but Riney  who speaks fluent Japanese  said that an informal poll he conducted showed thata more conservative name would be better, and not offensive,to Japanese.Regardless of the name, Riney  who previously worked for J.P. Morgan and has spent 15 years in Japan, including much of his childhood  believes that the 500 Startups brand and international connections offer a genuine opportunity to make a difference in Japans technology scene.Theres ahuge difference in funding between the U.S and Japan, he said. There really isnt a lot of money for entrepreneurs to get their business off the ground here, and Japanese investors really tend to be risk averse.Riney, who foundedStorys.jp  a Medium-like service for Japan  before becoming a VC with DeNA, believes that combining the best of East and West can unlockreal opportunity for 500 Startups.We are thebest know Silicon Valley VC to launch in Japan, he added. The startupecosystem [in Japan] is a black box, we want to bring more visibility and expertise.Riney, who had begun to make investments outside of Japan with DeNA, said that the opportunity to have greater autonomy and work with 500 Startups international team were among his primary motivations for making the switch. His job is just starting, however, since the $30 million fundisnt fully securedyet  thats something that he and his partner are working on now. Riney said most LPs in the fund are based in Japan, however there has been interest from overseas too.Foreign investors are interested [in Japan]. Many want to get involvedbut have no idea what to do, 500 Startups is a globally recognized brand that can help there, he added.
