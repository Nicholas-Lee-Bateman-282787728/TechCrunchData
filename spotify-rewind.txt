Ever wanted to find music you might love from days and decades gone by? If the answer is yes, or youre just a musical and curious soul, then Spotify has a new feature that isright up your alley.Spotify Rewind first spotted by VentureBeat  looks like a project put together by a collectionof Spotify engineers. (The company killed offits platform for third-party apps this year, ending the option of finding new tracks with services like Soundrop.)Rewind is a throwback to third-party service type fun on Spotify. You simply click the link, and then pick three artists who you like best from a prompt page. This is an important step, as these acts form the basis for the playlists that Spotify automagically pulls together for you from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.Each decades music plays as you swipe down the page, starting from the 2000s. If youre suitably impressed with what you hear, you can save any decadesplaylist to your Spotify account for future listening.I picked Wiz Khalifa, David Guetta and Nicki Minaj from my fairly limited list of initial options. Heres what I got in return.I saved the 1970s list because it seemed the most interesting, you can check it out below if you wish.Ugh, sorry folks, seems like were having a few issues  working on getting this to workRewind isan interesting feature that Id certainly like Spotify to spend more time adjusting. Given the amount of music that Spotifys 20 million users clock on the service, there are surely opportunities to help people find music tailored to their taste that they may not even know about. Likewise, the ability to match peoples music listening historyto decades of their favorite songscould be a powerful tool for converting casual users to regulars, or free customers into paying users.
