Massdrops investors have argued that the group commerce site is more a community than a straightforward marketplace. Heres one way that Massdrop is doing things differently  a new initiative called Massdrop Collabs.The startup has built specialist communities for folkssuch as audiophiles and mechanical keyboard fans, and it offers group-buying opportunities to those communities. With Massdrop Collabs, co-founder and CEO Steve El-Hage said the community can actually get involved in creatingthose products.Apparently Massdrop has done this kind of collaborativedesign before, for example with its Infinity Keyboard Kit, but now its pursuing these efforts in a more systematic way.The company says it worked with select enthusiasts from its audiophile community to design headphones, then it took those ideas to electronics company Fostex, resulting in theFostex x Massdrop TH-X00, with more than 15 elements (including the sound signature and the mahogany hardwood earcup material) chosen by the community.El-Hage described this as a process of many, many people coming together.Everybody contributes a little piece, he added. Were not allowingfor individual components to be voted on, were taking all ideas and combining theminto one big product suggestion.The headphones, for example, cost $399 and saw $1 million in sales in under 48 hours, and theyultimately sold to 3,167 Massdrop users.Massdrop Collabs isnt just for headphones. In the coming year, the companyplans to roll out thecollaborative design process to other communities, including mens style and everyday carry.
