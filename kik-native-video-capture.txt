Mobile messaging appKik has addednative video capture to its service as it lays the groundworktooffer more interactive content options forits 200 million registeredusers.An update to Kik for iOS and Android today now lets users record videos of up to 15 seconds from inside their chat windows. Thefeature includes a full-screen playback option, and videos will loop continuously.The new additionis pretty smooth, but video capture is astandard part of any communicationsservice these days.Kik  which offers a sophisticated in-chat browserfor sharing webcontent  admits it is playing catch up here.Now that it hasestablished its own video platform as a base, however, the Canada-based companyplans to go forth and bemore creative. Or, at least, offer its users the chance to unleash new shades ofcreativity on its service.Thats according to Joe Rideout, Kiksproduct manager forvideo and content, who joined the company when it acquired his GIF messaging startup Relay last year.(That deal gives you an idea of what Kik might have planned.)Rideout admitted that there is plenty of scope for Kik to develop video-related services but, for now, it isstaying focused and working on the highest priorities.We saw native video as an immediate need that hadto be met, he told TechCrunch in an interview. [Theres]a lot of tech that can be brought over [from Relay] we plan toreally explore all different kinds of content formats, starting with more traditional short-form video with audio.Third-party Kik apps will let you send GIFs to friends on Kik, but it makes sense for the companyto offer something more native  perhaps a way to create your own GIFs directly. That would chime nicelywith its youth-focused audience in North America, which is the very demographic withthe highestappreciation of GIFs and other kinds of new media. GoPop, the interestingapp that BuzzFeed recently snapped up (and is sadly closing down), is a good example of what can be done with moving images.Kik is not planning to follow Snapchats move into third-party media and content, but CEO and co-founder Ted Livingston has already said it willintroduce a payments service at some point this year. Maybe youll be able to GIF your money to a friend who knows whats possible in this brave new mobile messaging world.Yes, that isa joke. But if Snapchat can go from sexting app to reputable media platform, then, seriously,anything is possible.
