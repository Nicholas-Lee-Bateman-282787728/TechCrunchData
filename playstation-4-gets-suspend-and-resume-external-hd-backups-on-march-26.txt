Sonys upcoming Yukimura update for PlayStation 4 brings the console one magic power that many players have been eager to get their hands on: The ability to suspend game play and resume play right where you left off after putting the console into Rest Mode and then waking it up again.The Suspend/Resume function means you wont have to save to stop the action, and its much more convenient now that it survives the PS4s Rest Mode, which puts the console into a low-power, stasis-like state. Previously, games could be temporarily paused like this, but only while you exited to the menu to quickly check on something else.Another anticipated new feature coming with Yukimura (PS4 software version 2.50 if you want to get technical) is the ability to back-up and restore console HDD content to an external USB drive. That means you can fully back up the system, including everything from settings, saved data an screenshots to games, patches and downloads.You could back up saved data previously, but only to USB flash drives and everything else had to be re-downloaded from PlayStations servers if you ever needed to do a factory reset or set up a brand new console. This was not a super fun process, as I can personally attest, and being able to quickly load up your entire system as it had been from a mobile SSD should really help.Additional features include the ability to find fiends on PSN by searching through their linked Facebook account for those connections, and there are fewer steps required to make a party or join the games friends have in progress. You can now share your Trophy info via FB, Twitter or Message from the Share button menu, and Sony ha also added customization options for Dualshock 4 button layout, text-to-speech and graphical display options for accessibility benefits.The following additions are also new, direct from Sony:Remote Play and Share Play**:For games that support 60 fps, users will be able to stream those games with 60 fps for both Remote Play and Share Play on supported devices.Automatic Installation for System Software Updates: Users will be able to automatically install future system software updates.Sub-Account Upgrade:Users 18 years of age or older with sub-accounts will be able to upgrade to a master account directly on the PS4 system, removing restrictions on chat and enabling users to add funds to their Wallet, purchase content and more.Verified Accounts: Verified accounts for game industry professionals, including developers, producers, designers and community managers will appear with a badge.Dailymotion.com: Players will have the ability to upload video clips directly to Dailymotion via the SHARE button.
