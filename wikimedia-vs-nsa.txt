A constitutional challenge to the NSAs mass surveillance program, brought by Wikimedia earlier this year,was dismissed by a U.S. district court judge on Friday.Wikimedia announced it was suing the NSA back inMarch, along with eight otherorganizations, including The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International USA.The action had sought to arguethat dragnet surveillance was a threat to Wikimedias mission and a violation of fundamental U.S. constitutional rights.However, thejudge was not persuaded by the plaintiffs arguments, referencing a 2013 anti-surveillance case brought by Amnesty International which also failed to prevail on the grounds that the plaintiffs could not provide evidence, beyond the speculative, that their communications were being monitored by government intelligence agencies.Writing in his ruling on the Wikimedia case, the judge similarly asserts: Plaintiffs cannot provide a sufficient factual basis for their allegations because the scope and scale of Upstream surveillance remains classified, leaving plaintiffs to prop their allegations of actual injury on suppositions and speculation about how Upstream surveillancemust operate in order to achieve the governments stated goals.Hegoes on to notethat while more is known now about the nature and capabilities of NSA surveillance than was known in 2013, at the time of Amnestys legal action, no more is known about whether Upstream surveillanceactuallyinterprets all or substantially all international text-based Internet communications  concluding, therefore, that Wikimedias case relies ona chain of speculation and thusfails to establish legal standing.The judge also assertsthatWikimedia failed to persuade him onthe significance ofwhetherthe volume of its annual Internetcommunications a figure it claimed as more than 1trillion annual Internet communications  represents a significant proportion of the total number of Internet communicationsor not. Plaintiffs provide no context for assessing the significance of this figure, he writes.Likewise the judge dismissedarguments claimingharm to Wikimedias mission attributable tomass surveillance  again referencing the earlier Amnesty case andwriting: Plaintiffs cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending, nor can they establish injury based on third parties subjective fear of surveillance.The judge does notein his conclusion that legal standing to challenge a classified program in a civil case is not easily established, butadds: Such difficulty comes with the territory.
