We Heart It, a visual bookmarking service popular with teenaged girls, is transforming itself into a messaging app with the launch of new feature called Postcards.In a previous era, young girls sat around with fashion magazines and scissors and cut out their favorite inspirational images, turning them into collages or art for their bedroom walls. In todays digital age, teen girls use online services instead, including appslike Pinterest, Tumblr, and We Heart It.Though We Heart It didnt initially begin as service that was designed to attract a younger, female audience, over the years, it grew organically to become a popular destination for visual inspiration, especially among this demographic. Today, the service hasgrown to 30 million registered users, ranging in age from 15 to 24, with the average age being around 18.These young women are largely using the service on their mobile devices, too  with around 80% to 90% of We Heart Itactivity now taking places on mobile phones, and equally split between iOS and Android.In some respects, the service is a lot like a more youth-focused version of Pinterest.Theres a feed of image thumbnails, collections that are similar to Pinterests boards, user profiles, and the ability to favorite images by tapping on a heart, or adding them to your own collections. But while Pinterest is often focusedon images that link back to a source  a product page where you can buy the item or a magazine article, for example, We Heart It is really just about the images itself.Here, girls collect images that they find personally appealing, whether thats pictures of favorite celebs or bands, cute outfits, inspirational or emotional quotes, photos of nature or the outdoors, animals, beauty inspiration like nail art, funny sayings, food and recipes, home decor, original art, and much more.But now the company wants to take its product to the next level  to go beyond the social service it is today and tap into the bigger trend that is private mobile messaging.With Postcards, We Heart It is introducing a feature that lets any user on the site send a private message to another using one of the sites hundreds of millions of hosted images. The end result, the company hopes, will bea more engaged user base that turns to the We Heart It app more often.This dramatically expands the use case for us, in terms of how or when people we use We Heart It, explainsDave Williams, President of We Heart It. He says the company is very happy catering the young female demographic, and is working now to offer the kind of services those users want and need.We launched Postcards because what we were hearing from our users is that they wanted to communicate with each otherBut they dont need another messaging app, he says. Postcards is baked right into the core of the experience  you can launch a Postcard from any imageits not something where we said lets tack on messaging.'The feature itself is simple to use, and its true that it doesnt seem to have corrupted the overall experience of We Heart It, which is still very much about visual inspiration, not messaging. But if the company is successful in getting users to return to the app more often, that can impactWe Heart Its bottom line.More recently, the company has begun working with brands who seed the site with their own imagery as a way to get in front of this coveted demographic. In addition, brands can pay to promote their images in We Heart Its main feed and search results, and the company has already done around a dozen deals related to this with companies including Disney, Lionsgate/CBS Films, Hollister, Macys, Vera Wang, and others.While Williams couldnt talk about the size of the deals specifically, he would say they were substantial and many were six figures.In addition, several brands returned to advertise again after the pilot trial completed.The company measures success by the heart rate brands images receive, Williams explains. That is, the ads are hearted by users and then those users followers see them and heart them, too. Were seeing as high as, or much higher in some cases, 30% earned impressions, Williams notes.To kick off the launch of Postcards, the company has a number of brands and celebsparticipating, includingShakira,Teen Vogue,Starbucks, and others.The new feature is live now for all users on the We Heart It iOS and Android application.
