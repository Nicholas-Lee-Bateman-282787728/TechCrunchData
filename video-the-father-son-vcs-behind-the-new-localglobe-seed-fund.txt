Robin and Saul Klein are the father and son VCs behind the new LocalGlobe seed fund (website, twitter, Medium). Just recently they led a 1.1 million investment in online mortgage advisor Trussle.Its likely to be among the first of many.Saul has been actively involved founding and investing in over 100 tech companies in London since at least 1994, Robin for, well, a little longer.We decided to meet up with them and get an idea of how the fund will operate, what its like working with family, and where LocalGlobe plans to sit in the London and European investor ecosystem.Saul admits he is more conceptual, says Robin, while Robin says he is more analytical. And they are both bullish about the Internet economy and startups, despite the global volatility in the market right now, and the potential downturn of some so-called unicorns.In particular, Saul Klein is a passionate about London as a centre for investing across Europe. So much so that hes written a blog post about it.He says London is so firmly on the map for startups and scale-ups.These include the fact that UK GDP is top 5% globally and growing; Internet as a percentage of national GDP is at the top of the G20; London speaks 300 languages; the UK is the largest market other than the US and China for all major tech companies because of the UK consumers higher propensity to be mass-market early adopters of technology;Meanwhile, London has inherent and deep institutional strengths across both public and private sectors.But lets face it, a London-based VC would say that wouldnt they. Still, its hard to argue with the empirical facts on the ground, with over 30bn of new value from the likes of ASOS, Betfair, JustEat, King, MoneySupermarket, Paysafe, Sophos, Rightmove, Markit, Mimecast, Worldpay and Zoopla.Emerging stars include Deliveroo, Farfetch, Funding Circle, Shazam, Transferwise, Worldremit plus Skyscanner and FanDuel, admittedly in Scotland. They are joined by Citymapper, Datasift, Huddle, Improbable, Lyst, Moo, OneFineStay, Secret Escapes, Songkick and Swiftkey.As Saul says, the fact that US tech firms have so much money on their balance sheets right now, that to acquire European tech startups is potentially a great opportunity.How do they think they will compete in the market against many new seed funds? They arent worried about the competition given the supply [of great startups] is so great says Robin.Plus they plan to take a co-operative approach to investing with other funds in Europe.Its fair to say that this long-time double-act is going to be around for some time longer in Europe.
