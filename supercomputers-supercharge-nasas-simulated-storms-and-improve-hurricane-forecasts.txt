Understanding the complex order behind the apparent chaos of a tropical storm or hurricane is no easy task, but its worthwhile to try  such storms deal death and destruction globally, and the better we know them, the better we can prepare for them. A NASA blog post highlights some of the work and improvements in storm prediction and simulation being done at the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office.Over the last decade, the systems used by the GMAO have advanced a great deal: like so many other researchers and industries, these climate scientists have benefited both from a greater volume of data and plentiful computing power with which to sift through it.Oreste Reale (right) and gMAO colleague Marangelly Fuentes.In order to predict the paths and intensities of future storms, GMAO scientists must create simulations  computer models of storms that, for lack of infinite processing power, must make compromises in terms of accuracy.In the model we basically transform Earths atmosphere into little cubes and in each cube the fundamental equations controlling motion, energy and continuity of the atmosphere are solved, said GMAO meteorologist Oreste Reale in NASAs post. The smaller the size of the cube, the more realistic the representation of the atmosphere.Those cubes have shrunk from about 31 miles across to 8 over the last decade  at great computing cost, since they also include far more data, but also to great benefit.As an illustration of how far models have come, here are two models of Hurricane Katrina, one from 2005 and one from 2015:The higher resolution isnt just for looks, either. 2005 models drastically underestimated the atmospheric pressure levels the storm would reach; 2015 models come much closer.Reale is on a team in the GMAO that considers new data sets and computer models and makes sure that they are working together properly.We need to add complexity all the time, Reale said, and nobody here is afraid of doing that. You dont want a simple solution. If its simple, chances are its not true.
