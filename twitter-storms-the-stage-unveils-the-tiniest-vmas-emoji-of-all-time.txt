Today, Twitter launched an emoji tied to the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, which will air this weekend. Users hash tagging either #VMA of #VMAs will get avery tinymoon man emoji to pop up in their tweet.Like, seriously, this is how big it is:Full-sized it looks way cooler though:We already know Twitter is deep inpreparations to revamp how it approacheseventswith its project lightning feature. Over the past few months, the service has also launched a fewcustom emojis as a fun way of visually unifying conversations about a particular event thats happening.For now, the company is just working on its own or with select partners to create customemojis like this. Twitterhas already produced emojis for the Womens World Cup, UK Election, Ramadan, Copa America in Latin America and the latest Star Wars trailer.Andrew Fitzgeraldfrom Twitters Media Strategy and Operations team talked about the role of emojis in tweetsin a Q&A with TechCrunch earlier this month:Twitter emojis are a part of our ongoing efforts to make Twitter a fun, interactive place for users to express themselves. Just as we integrated native video into the product and have acquired Periscope, we feel like the Twitter emoji adds a new dimension to our content experiences by encouraging users to broadcast their enthusiasm for an event or moment in a visual way.Twitter emojis, like Facebook stickers, are super fun to play around with and are really popular, but as a branding method, theyjust seem a littletoo small to convey muchinfo, though some designs work better than others.The VMAs moon man is awesome when viewed full-size, but in tweets it feels like you might need one of these to see him planting hisflag.
