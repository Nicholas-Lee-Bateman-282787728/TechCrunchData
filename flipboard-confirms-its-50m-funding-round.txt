Flipboard has confirmed to us thatit hasraised $50 million, two days after we first reportedthat the company had authorized the shares earlier this year. JP Morgan was the sole investor, the company says. We raised this round with JP Morgan, one of the best institutional investors in the world. They are a fantastic team to have on board, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.The funding will be used to build out the product and team, the company said.TechCrunch reported earlierthat,according to a regulatory document filed in Delaware, Flipboard had authorized the sale of $50 million worth of Flipboard shares at the same price as its previous funding round.The raise comes at a time when rumors cropped up that Twitter might buy Flipboard  though, to be sure, its not exactly clear how far those talks progressed  and had held discussions withother companies like Google and Yahoo.The company also providedsome updated numbers on usage. It now has72 million monthly active users, with the vast majority of that coming from mobile devices. Earlier in July, it was reported that the companys numbers had jumped 75 percent in the last six months to 70 million on the back of web-usergrowth. The company said it sees anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 activations every day around the world.Flipboards funding will also help in stiff competition from new entries like Apple News. The bigger questionishow and if anindependentcompany  and Flipboard is not the only one in this boat  can continue to grow in the face ofcompetition from a platform giant.
