Dennis Mitzner lives in Tel Aviv and writes about startups and technology trends.Sirin Labs, a new high-end smartphone manufacturer,has raiseda $72 million seed round from Singulariteam founder Moshe Hogeg, Kazakh businessman Kenges Rakishev, and the Chinese social networking service Renrento launch a new, secure smartphone.The phone will be revealed in May at Sirin Labs flagship store in London.Against a backdrop ofglobal concerns over digital security likeApples dustup with theFBI and Whatsapps encryption announcement;the new phone company (now almost three years in the making) aspires to combine both the safety of a military-grade device and the features of an everyday phone.We managed to combine military phone and the phone for everyday useWe said: lets create the best phone we can. Lets see if we can integrate the best from both worlds without limitations, said Hogeg.That combined functionality will cost a pretty penny, according to Hogeg.It wont be the most expensive phone in the world. We are in the neighborhood of $10-15k per phone. Tesla is a good example for us. They started with high priced cars, but today their car prices are much lower.Considering the phones high price point, Fortune 500 executive seems to be a likelier customer profile than a 25 year-old tech lover.Hogeg says he is looking to create a high-end product in a vertical where its sorely missing.As tech lovers, we said we wanted to bring the most sophisticated tech out there into the smartphone, said Hogeg.91% of Fortune 500 companies are under cyber attacks, but companies cant use a military phone because they usually lack all the apps that consumers use.Moshe Hogeg.

The secure phone space remainsfairlywide-opensinceBlackberry left in 2013 and is now focusing on security-focused enterprise customers with.Silent Circles Blackphone is currently trying to take the lead among consumers. The companys phone is priced atonly $799, which means avery differentcustomer from Sirins targets.However, in February last year, Silent Circle announced  as part of the $50 million round  its intention to grab BlackBerrys market share and woo business users.Finland-based Bittium revealed its Bittium Tough Mobile at the Mobile World Congress in February to compete head to head with the Blackphone and ARCHOS similarly priced GranitePhone.With ARCHOS, Silent Circle and Bittium all battling for market share, Hogegs Sirin Labs is launching at a time when consumers, animated by mainly aesthetic concerns, are perhaps willing to pay more for security without compromising on usability  or giving up on the joy of time-wasting apps.Most secure phone manufacturers are strictly in the enterprise space, andSirins high price point will likelyput the company in that category, unlessHogegs thesis of Tesla-like adoption for the companys product comes to fruition.Known for security expertise, Hogeg bets on Israelis to provide Sirin with the knowledge to dominate the secure phone market. Headquartered in Switzerland, most of Sirins day to day operations are managed from the companys offices in Tel Aviv (R&D and operations) and in the Swedish city of Lund where they are assembled by Sigma Connectivity.Hogeg believes that the combination of Swedish engineering and Israeli security expertise is a winning recipe.Tel Aviv is a high-tech epicentre built around internet security, anti-virus software and cyber-defence technologies, and Sweden is a nucleus for some of the best telecomms engineers, designers and computer scientists in the world, the Yo app founder said.Although Rakishev and RenRen have previously invested in Hogegs Singulariteam, Sirin is an entirely separate venture for both.Rakishev, a serial investor and petrochemical mogul, and Hogeg have partnered in a number of projects, including Mobli and Genesis Angels, then chaired by the now jailed ex-prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert.Sirin is the latest project between the two men and was born in 2013 when Rakishevs phone was hacked. While the attack damagedRakishevs phone, it did even more to damage his faith in mobile technology.Rakishev called me to share the story about his hacked phone and asked why he was unable to find a mobile phone that would ensure privacy while meeting the needs of an international business person, and why the new technology he saw in tech shows and tech publications wasnt available in consumer devices, said Hogeg.The companys operational lead and CEO is Tal Cohen, a former McKinsey consultant. Other key people include Fredrik Oijer, former product director at Sony Ericsson and Karim Rashid, known for his sensual minimalism, is in charge of design.Rashid, well known for designing luxury items, is not designing a luxury phone.Sirin is not about luxury, It is about advanced technology which in turn results in high-end products, Hogeg said.The company is looking to beat competition by focusing both on usability and security for the consumer space. Currently, most companies that offer full encryption are enterprise-focused.We have a holistic approach, which integrates hardware and software solutions to ensure the best security and encryption. The specifics will be revealed in our product launch event later this year, Hogeg said.Renren, one of the investors announced today, refused to comment on its role in Sirin, but considering the companys preexisting relationship with Hogeg and the recent acceleration of Chinese interest in Israel, stranger things have happened. Whats more, with over 160 million users on its social platform and a strong focus on mobile, its hardly a surprise for the company to desire a stake in the secure smartphone market.
