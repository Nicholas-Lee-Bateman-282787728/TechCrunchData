Aerodrome is working with the City of Boulder, Nevada, to launch the first commercial drone airport  the Eldorado Droneport. Its one of only a handful of FAA-appointed UAS test sites in the United States.The plan is to offertraining, maintenance and other support functions for the commercial drone industry, as well as for individual drone pilots. The company already operates teaching facilities in Detroit, Michigan and Henderson, Nevada.The plan is tocomplete the construction of the droneport with its adjacenttraining facilities in about three years. The team tells me that it already operates on a five-acre parcel in Boulder.We caught up with Aerdromes at CES.
