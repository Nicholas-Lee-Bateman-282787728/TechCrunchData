Spotifys ability to personalize its music recommendations is getting another big boost today, with the launch of a new feature that will now point its users to area concerts they may like to attend. Similar to how Spotify suggests songs in its popular weekly playlists, the Concerts feature leverages data aboutuserslistening behavior, and will update its concert picks as that behavior evolves, the company explains.In addition, if youre traveling to a new city, youre able to change your location within the app to see concerts outside of your hometown. You can also do this at any time, which can help with trip planning.Spotify says the feature was built in partnership with Songkick, which is helping to power the artist tour dates. Songkick and Spotify already had a relationship of sorts  the service was one of the apps that used to run on Spotifys long-shuttered app platform.The move could impact rival services music fans currently use to track upcoming events, like Songkick competitor Bandsintown, for example, which touts some 19 million registered users.Once these concert detailsare fed directly into Spotifysmain app where youre enjoying your music on a daily basis  and the appsrecommendations are targeted to your interests  you may be less likely to turn to a standalone servicein the future for similar information.Spotifyalready has a well-tuned recommendation engine, as its algorithmically generated Discover Weekly playlist is one the apps most-loved features. The playlist, which is delivered every Monday to web and mobile, offers two hours of music based on what those users with similar tastes are adding to their own mixes. Spotifys user base is so addicted to this feature, that when their playlist was delayed due a glitch this fall, they were furious and lashed out on social media. Thats devotion.It alsobodes well for Spotifys ability to also find concerts youll like going forward.The Concerts feature will not only alert you to nearby shows, but also allows artists to reach out to Spotifys user base  something that putsthe feature up against Apple Music, and its own social platform for artist-to-fan communication, Connect.Concerts is rolling out now to all iPhone and Android users, the company says. To see if you have the feature in your own app, open the Browse tab on your phone and look for the Concerts option.
