One of the nice things about Instagram is that unlike the rest of the web, the platform is generally devoid ofannoying hyperlinks in posts and comments.However, while no hyperlinks make a cleaner user experience, they also make it hard fore-commerce brands to drive shoppersto external sites.Instagram hasnt exactly helped these brands, as they only alloweach profile a single hyperlink on the brandsmain page.One solution is Photoslurp, a service that provides brands with a custom profile hyperlink that once clicked, will take shoppers to an external e-commerce site with the same look and feel as Instagram.This Instagram-style pageintegrates directly with a stores inventory, making it an intermediate site between lifestyle pictures of a product, and the page to actually purchase that product.Above: Photoslurps platform on the left, Instagram on the right.Essentially, the company is betting that a photo-based, Instagram-like shopping experience will lead to more sales than if a company just provided a link to their main website. And, it seems to be working. According to the company, beta tests have shown click-through rates of around 60 percent.In addition to thisshoppable Instagram platform, the company also offers a visual commerce experience that lets brands find and userphotos of customers advocating the brands products, which boasts customer like Birchbox Spain andLindblad Expeditions/National Geographic.Ben Heinkel, the companys cofounder and CTO, says that the company eventuallyhopes to provide brands with a unified visual marketing platform, from which they are able to manage all their visual content in one place.While Instagram may eventually turn on the switch for in-app e-commerce purchases, it seems that third-party workarounds like Photoslurp are currently the best bet for brands trying to turn social media users into paid customers.
