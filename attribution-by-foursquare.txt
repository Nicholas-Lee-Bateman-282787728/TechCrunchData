Foursquare announced a new product today that should help brick-and-mortar advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.The company has already been expanding the ad side of the business, for example launching new ad targeting productlast year and recently bringing on CEO Jeff Glueck to grow itsenterprise tools.Now, with Attribution Powered by Foursquare, the company is making its data available to advertiserseven if they dont run campaignsin the Foursquare or Swarm apps. Naturally, that data is focused on location  that may be Foursquares big selling point compared to Facebook and Twitter, which have also been working to expand their ad capabilities beyond their own properties.President Steven Rosenblatt said the company has created a representative sampleof about 1.3 million people (out of its total of 50 million active users) who have opted in to constantly share their location data with Foursquare. So his teamcan findusers inthe panel who have seen an ad, examine their behavior, then compare it to a similar group of users who didnt see the ad. That, in turn, allows Foursquare to extrapolate how much the ad resulted in a lift in store visits.And while you might wonder whether Foursquare users would makea good stand-in for the population as a whole, Rosenblatt said the company has built a panel thats similar to the broader US consumer base in terms of age, gender and location (though its a bit weaker when it comes topeople under 18 and over 55 years old). Plus, he argued theres no one even close in terms of the size of their panel, particularly when it comes to measuring user behavior directly  for example he noted that Nielsen measures just 40,000 households.In an early test, Flipboard said that by using this technology, it was ableshow an advertiser that their campaign resulted in a 12 percent incremental lift. Other launch partners include Brown-Forman (makers of Jack Daniels), TGI Fridays and ad-tech companies Drawbridge and Adelphic.Mall of America Place Shapes from Foursquare on Vimeo.Rosenblatt also noted that Foursquare can provide this data to advertisers on a daily basis, rather than making them wait forweeks, and that the company has years of location data that it can use to determine whether or not youre really in a given location. As for privacy, he emphasized that these users have opted in to share their data, and that its all aggregated and anonymized.Asked how these products fit into Foursquares consumer strategy, Rosenblatt replied, The consumer apps are the foundation of everything we ultimately do. We will continue to use our technology and the incredible location intelligence we have to enhance those experiences. They go hand-in-hand  they really do.
