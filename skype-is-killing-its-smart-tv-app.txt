Skype, the Microsoft-owned video calling service, has quietly announced that it will no longer offer an app forsmart TVs starting in June.Confirmation of the shutdown comes via a support page  first spotted by the BBC  whichexplains that smartphones and tablets have proven to be a more popular platform for Skype users.Over the years, users have changed the way they use Skype, with the majority accessing it from a mobile device  including when in the living room. We want to make sure we prioritize delivering the best possible experience to the platforms our users are asking for, which is why weve decided to focus our efforts in other areas while supporting key functionality on Skype for TV for as long as possible.Skype became available for smart TVs back in 2010. The app was pre-loaded on some sets  such as those from Samsung and LG  andavailable to download on many others, including models fromSony, Panasonic and Sharp.As someone who had used it in the past, I found that the appdidnt quite deliver on itspromise  which sounds greatin theory. The service was somewhat unreliable and tricky to set up, whereas picking up aphone or tablet and launching an app is second nature to people these days. Plus, there are many more video calling options, including nearly every popular messaging app and Apples own FaceTime service.Skypes smart TV app will no longerreceive updates after June 1, but those who have already downloaded it can continue to use it. Theres no confirmed date for when the app will cease to work, butit is living on borrowed time.
