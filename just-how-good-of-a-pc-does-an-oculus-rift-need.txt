The Oculus Rift is now available for pre-order at $599, but theres been some confusion about what else youll need to plug it in and getting going once it hits your doorstep.Wait just a minute. You need a Windows PC to run Oculus Rift. https://t.co/jxq0qsAPHn Steve Garfield (@stevegarfield) January 6, 2016I still *regularly* see people react with "That Oculus thing requires a PC?" There's SO MUCH education left to do on VR still. Ben Gilbert (@RealBenGilbert) January 6, 2016Yes, you need a PC.Yes, that PC needs to be pretty heavy-duty.In their pre-order post today, the company shared a link to a compatibility tool that will tell you whether your computer is ableto run the new Rift or not. Gamers, who are probably the early adopters lining up for a Rift, are probably well prepared.Here are the recommendations from Oculus for the full Rift experience:graphics card: NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD R9 290 equivalent or greater
processor: Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater
memory: 8GB+ RAM
output: Compatible HDMI 1.3 video output
input: 3x USB 3.0 ports plus 1x USB 2.0 port
operating system: Windows 7 SP1 64 bit or newerTry using the tool on your current setup. If you dont meet the recommendations, youll see something like this:So yes, this is a surprise to some, but most knew ahead of time that this was a requirement. Why the surprise for some folks? Its a new technology with a fair bit of hype, but a lot of ins and outs.Now you get why Oculus partnered with Samsung on the $99 Gear VR. It got virtual reality experiences to people faster, and all you need is a phone to run it. And its mobile.
