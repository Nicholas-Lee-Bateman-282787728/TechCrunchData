Zoomdata, a company thats trying to transform business intelligence by connecting to both modern and traditional data sources at scale, announced a $25 million Series C round today.The investment was led by Goldman SachsPrincipal Strategic Investments Group.New investor Comcast Ventures also participated along with prior investors Accel, Columbus Nova Technology Partners and NEA. With todays take, Zoomdatahas now raised just over $47 million, according to Crunchbase. The companys most recent round prior to today was a$17 million Series B in October, 2014.In a time where Series B and C money is getting harder to come by through conventional venture capital channels, its interesting that Zoomdata captured the interestof the strategic investment arm of Goldman Sachs and from Comcast Ventures, the venture arm of the cable giant.Zoomdata provides companies with business intelligencedashboards connected to modern data sources like a Cloudera or Hortonworks Hadoop cluster, Elasticsearch andNoSQL sources. It also connects toa more traditional SQL database sources, and it does all of this without creating a copy of the data to visualize it,reducing the risk associated withhaving copies of the data stored invarious places.The company competes in the BI market withtraditionaltools like IBM Cognos and SAP BusinessObjects or even somewhat more modern ones likeTableau and Qlik. Unlike those companies, whichwere born in the world of SQL and data warehouses with smaller data requirements , Zoomdata was built to deal with modern data sources like Hadoop and NoSQL and much larger data sets, CEO Justin Langseth told TechCrunch..While Langseth acknowledged competitors have beenaddingsupport fornewer data sources too, he said theirolder code base makesit more difficult to deal with big data scale.The company actually began working with Goldman Sachs a year ago when company representatives swarmedthe Zoomdata booth at the Spark Summit in New York City and began peppering them with questions, Langseth said. Over the last year hes met with Goldman officials a bunch of times, and over that time theyve become a customer. While the product has met manyof Goldmans requirements, there were things it wanted that the were missing. Todaysinvestment in Zoomdata is designed tohelp speed up the product road map and add those missing pieces that are important to this key customer.Comcast, too is a customer, but Langseth said the Comcast Ventures investment was probably more financial than strategic.As for hismore traditional venture capitalist investors  they probably liked what they were seeing from the company in terms of growth including 11 X year over year growth, 35customers (up from 20 during the 2014 round) and expanded partnerships with the likes of Cisco, Cloudera, Hortonworks, IBM and Microsoft.As part of the deal Rana Yared, managing director in the Principal Strategic Investments Group at Goldman Sachs, will join the Zoomdata board of directors.Its worth noting that this is the second Goldman SachsPrincipal Strategic Investments Group investment we have reported on this month. They also led a $30 million investment in Sonatype.
