The day is finally here! The rumor mill has been whispering about a massive Google announcement for weeks, and were live on the scene.So whats coming? According to whispers, were bound to see everything from a new Nexus 5 and Nexus 6, to a new Chromecast, to new details about Android Marshmallow. Tune in for details straight from the event!The event is scheduled to start at 9 A.M Pacific.Okay were all good. Thanks again for tuning in!everyone is trippingoh god they turned off the lights as were leavingNice work folks. I need some coffee.Hands on time!!!Hands on time Greg?Sounds like were wrapping upItll ship later this year, before the holidaysThe keyboard will be $149Tablet will be$499 or $599 for 32gb or 64gb respectivelyThe keyboard and the tablet are sold separately! bummer.More voice, more voice. This might be the device you leave on the coffee table (if you have one)It sort of feels like theyre quietly killing the Chromebook right now, even if not outrightIt has four microphones built in, allowing for voice actions from across the roomThe screen on the Pixel C is 25601800, and 500 nits brightness. It has an Nvideo Tegra X1 (Maxwell) GPU, with 3GB of RAM and stereo speakersWhen closed, the tablet itself charges the keyboard inductively. The keyboard will last 2 months on one chargeI mean, its pretty, but Im not sure if I want one. I have an iPad that I dont use, as well as an Amazon Fire HD.When you need a keyboard again, it just slides right back into placeWhen the keyboard isnt in use, you can attach it to the back of the tablet to get it out of the way.If youve used the Pixels keyboard, the Pixel Cs keyboard is said to feel quite similar.The key here is that the Pixel C runs Android, NOT ChromeOS. Not sure why it doesnt run both (id love to do that) Also, square roots and stuff.The Pixel C screen is 10.2 inchesThe C, by the way, stands for convertibleTheres no kickstand, and no complicated mechanism with limited tilt  the hinge seems to have a damned impressive range of motion for something like thisLets get the Surface jokes out of the way now.Theyve just announced the Pixel C  its an Android device that looks like a Pixel Chromebook. Its a laptop by default, but the screen can detach from the keyboard to be used as a standard tablet. Everything attaches magneticallyWere recapping the previous Pixel; the high-res screen, the USB C connection, etc.Sounds like were moving onto the Pixel, Googles built-as-an-example-of-the-best ChromebookThats it for Chromecast/Chromecast Audio stuff.Chromecast Audio goes up for sale today, also at $35The pricepoint on these things make it a no brainer IMOChromecast audio willsupport multi-room. Itll come later this year via over-the-air update.Youll be able to mirror audio from Android devices or Chrome on your computer to your speakersLike YouTube on the Chromecast, Chromecast Audio will be able to handle shared/group playlistsThey demo Chromecast Audio with Lean On by Major Lazer. Everybody goes nuts; the room is now a rave. not really, its mostly just me. but i heart this song.Spotify is picking up Chromecast and Chromecast Audio support in the coming weeksGuest mode, introduced a few months ago, will still work with Chromecast Audio. People who arent on your Wifi, but are nearby, can connect to your Chromecast AudioIt worksjustlike Chromecast does, within an app. Put Chromecast Audio on your network, tap the Chromecast button in the app, and push to a speaker.Wellllll, well see about that. They havent said if it does multi-room yet!Goodnight, Sonos.Chromecast Audio already works with all of the top audio apps that work with Chromecast todayWeve transitioned into talking specifically about Chromecast Audionot sure why youd want a color chromecast since it goes behind the tv, but whatevs.Itll be up for sale in Google Play, Best Buy, and WalmartThe new Chromecasts will go on sale today in 17 countries at $35Chromecast will be able to pull in your Facebook and Flickr feeds as backdropstheres a few other games coming up by the end of the year:Angry Birds Friends, WGT Golf, Monopoly Here and Now, Mini Motors WRT and Driver Speedboat ParadiseChromecast games can support multiple players, each with their own controllerChromecast games will be able to use all of the phones sensors  the gyro, accelerometer, touch, etc.Next up: Games. Theyre casting a game to the screen, whilst using the phone as a controllerangry birds go is so ridiculously fast on a new nexus phone and new chromecastApps can also try to predict what you want to watch, and start pre-loading that video  so as soon as you tap play, its ready to go sans buffering.Open Netflix on your phone, for example, and your Chromecasts will load Netflix in the background so its immediately available without the traditional loading processA new capability, called Fast Play, will start caching and pre-loading the app to Chromecast as soon as you open an appIt aggregates data from all of your Cast-enabled apps. Searching X-Files, for example, returns a page that lets you pick a source to play from, be it Netflix, Amazon, or Google Play.the idea here is that you dont know what you want to watch, or where it is. search or get suggestions based on the apps you HAVE already.The devices tab  where all the Chromecasts on your network are listed  can now pause/control all Chromecasts on your network.like ive been saying, the phone is the best controller. why would anyone want to learn how to use a new remote or joystick. meh.OMG U CAN MAKE A PHONE CALL AND PLAY MUSIKHe taps a listing in the Chromecast app for Black Sails, a Showtime show. It tosses him right to the relevant place in the Showtime app.Itll now bring in an index of content from all the Cast-enabled apps on your phone, allowing it to serve as a search/content discovery engineUntil now, the Chromecast app has been pretty much exclusively for configuring your ChromecastToday, were excited to announce a completely redone Chromecast app for Android and iOSTurn dumb speakers into smart ones.It plugs in over 3.5mm, but RCA/Optical support is mentionedIt looks quite similar to the other 2nd gen Chromecast  but rather than being flat and glossy, it has a series of circular grooves that make it look a bit like a vinyl recordChromecast Audio is a small device that plugs into an existing speaker and streams audio from your favorite Cast-enabled appsNext announcement: Chromecast AudioThey show a graph comparing wifi performance; the new Chromecast smokes the previous generation.An algorithm will always use the best WiFi signal for the ever changing attenuation in your homeThe HDMI cord is also built-in, no more extra wires.The small size of the Chromecast lets it hide behind the TV without cluttering your living room. It actually plugs and hangs by its cable, rather than jutting out from the port. Curious!Its circular to house 3 separate antennas. Its a genius design.More soon.If youve seen the pics that leaked a few weeks back, thats the one: its a lil circle, rather than a stick.first: the New ChromecastToday, were also very happy to announce 2 new Chromecast productsToday, were excited to announce that we have sold more than 20 million Chromecasts globallyItll also come this fall to sports apps from NBA, MLB, and more. Details are light there; sorry sportsfans.One lil tid bit that gets a passing mention: Starting today, showtime will bring all of its content to Chromecast. SlingTV support is coming soon too.As rumored: this announcement is about hooking into speakersWere recapping how Chromecast works: your phone is your remote, and you send stuff to your TV from the apps you already use.Its time to take your TV over.Thats it for Google Photos! Next up: ChromecastCasting will come to Google Photos on Android this week, and iOS later.Photos that havent been backed up are clearly marked with a crossed-out cloud; you can still cast those photos, regardless.ANIMATED GIFSSSSSSSSSI can even cast an animated GIF!YEEEEEES! YEEEEESSSSS my life is complete everyone go homeThird feature: Google Photos is finally getting Chromecast support. This has been a point of frustration since Google dropped photos from Google+This feature will start rolling out on Android later this week.Name labels are kept private to you  so this (seemingly) isnt Googles way of tying names to faces behind the scenes.Google Photos already identifies people who pop up in your photos a lot. You can now give each person a name, allowing you to search for people by name  or to search for things like photos of mom and billWere diving into how Google Photos handles searching amongst massive libraries (and the machine learning voodoo that goes into identifying people)So thats the first feature: shared albums. Itll launch later this yearYou can also now subscribe to an album that has been shared with you, notifying you whenever new photos are added.Each uploaded photo has a small label identifying who took a given photo at a glance  it sounds small, but thats actually something a lot of these group-photo-taking services get wrong.Youll be able to invite people to add photos to your albums  particularly handy for when you and your family (or friends) are at the same event.Google Photos is getting shared, collaborative album support.Today, im excited to announce 3 new features for Google PhotosPhotos play a powerful role in bringing families together. Theres nothing like that feeling of reminiscing over an album. Four months ago, we launched Google Photos; in the time since launch, people have already uploaded over 50 billion pictures and videosNext up: Google PhotosItll launch later this yearFor $14.99 per month, 6 people can be on one family plan, each with their own recommendations and playlistsThis is why we have two Google Play accounts, and we listen to music independently. For family like ours, im excited to announce Google Play Music Family PlanWhen I was in New York, I fell in love with hip hop. Biggie. Wu tang. But my husband.. he loves stuff like the Smiths and the CureShes recapping Google Plays recently launched family sections, and how Google Play hearts families.Were jumping into details about Google Play  I have a feeling this one will be a quickie tooOh, thats it for Android Wear, actually  no huge new news there.Android Wear commercial!She jabs at Apple Watch.

When you havent moved your phone, itll sync data and whatnot less frequently.With Marshmallow, we think weve made the [biggest battery life improvements] to dateGoogles voice stuff is better than Siri by far. Theyve been training this thing for years and years and years.Okay Google, listen to NPRGoogle Now responds: Heres the latest news. Do you want to resume where you were, or catch up on the latest news?Android 6.0 will have considerably more voice actions; developers will be able to build conversational voice actions right into their apps.Hes doing a quick demo. We see a whatsapp conversation.Lets meet at Cascal for dinner tomorrow, reads the chat.He holds the home button; details about Cascal (reservations, hours, etc) pop up automatically.Google Now On Tap, their context sensitive functionality (so you can ask questions about whats currently on screen), will launch with the 6P and 5XYay for uninstalling preloaded apps!Android Marshmallow will have fewer preloaded apps out of the box, though no specific number is given. However, Preloaded apps can now be uninstalledTheyve greatly simplified the permissions process for installing apps; apps will now ask for permissions when they actually need them, rather than at install.The app drawer now has a search bar at the top  while the top row of icons will show apps that you usually use around this time of day.Marshmallow will feature new window animations, built with Material design in mind. Notifications now slide in and out from above, and can be tossed away with a quick swipe.Theres a tweaked lock screen with faster voice actions, and an indicator that lets you know if the phone is in fast charging mode.Fast charging with USB type C. Shows you how long itll take to charge. Thats a super nice feature.Hes recapping some of Marshmallows already announced features, but is about to dive into brand new stuffNext topic: Android 6.0 MarshmallowItll be integrated into 1Password, Venmo, Mint, and a bunch of other third party apps right out of the gateThe sensor is located on the back of the 6P, allowing you to place your finger on the back of the device in a rather natural way.On its false reject rate, it almost never failsIt recognizes a finger in under 600 ms.Next topic, Nexus Imprint  the new Nexus fingerprint reader. Itll open up fingerprint recognition to our entire Android ecosystemIt can do things like detect when the phone has been picked up or set down, and shift power to the screen accordingly. If it hasnt moved in a while, itll drop into a lower power mode.The Nexus 5S and 6P use something called the Android Sensor Hub to offload processing activity from the CPU to dedicated chips to boost efficiency.Weve also added a new feature to the 6P called Smart burst. Hold down the record button, and itll record a burst at 30FPSHe specifically mentions GIFs as the file formatOhhai Smartbursts. Sounds live live photosThe 6P will be able to record at 240FPSWere comparing photos between the latest flagship devices (iPhone 6S, previous Nexus, etc), particularly at sunset. As youd expect for photos shown in their own demo, the 6P takes the best photo:) These photos look greatItll use IR lasers for super fast auto-focusThe 12.3MP camera, with its 1.55 micron pixel sensor, is 92% more efficient at gathering light than the past generation Nexus. In other words: better pictures at lower lightThese phones are absolutely gorgeous and are probably the first ones that iPhone users will take a second look at from Android world.Were diving into how the new cameras handle photography  specifically indoor photos.Itll feature Nexus Imprint, which sounds like a fingerprint readerThe 5X, too, will have USB Type-C chargingItll have a 64 bit processor of unspecified clockageThe battery has been increased by nearly 20%, to 2700mAhItll have a 5.2 screen, while weighing just 136 gramsAlso coming: The Nexus 5X.6P will run Android Marshmallow, and like all Nexus devices, gets updates directly from Google(Phew!

Lets goooooooooo!Chris Velazco (TC Alum) being not entirely sure which way to point the camera:
the music is pretty chill tbh. bluegrassy.That picture reminds me I meant to shave. OH WELL. 2 more minutes before the event starts.Also, someone took a photo of me taking that photo, so that exists on some live blog somewhere. Im on the Internet!Cameras hate me.Man we are way sexier than the Apple liveblog team, which also includes Greg.Team photo! https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dsc_0013.jpg?w=680Also, its national coffee day, so celebrate it up everyone!!!And were five minutes away from seeing a massive refresh of all of the treats.Your live bloggers for today are @Grgand @Drewand if our computers explode or he has something awesome to say,@FredericlNo Sundar yet, but we spotted Bradley Horowitz and I scared the crap out of him by accident.Hardware and ChillBasically everyone in the room:
Theyve kept the guest list pretty tight this time, particularly compared to Apples kind-of-insane event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium a few weeks back. This one is way more low key  which is nice!Shout out to whoever named their WiFi network ChubbyBunnyI wonder if theyre announcing anything having to do with the home?
10 minutes to go before the show begins!Also, Frederic is drinking the coffee that I wish I had.Its a new venue for us, so pardon the dust as we deal with WiFi connectivity chaos and whatnot. So far, so good!Were in a tiny little room in a neighborhood that is probably all afraid of getting kicked out of their places because the tech is comingTesting, testing  this thing on?Ohhai!
