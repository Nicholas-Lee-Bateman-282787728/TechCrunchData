In the aftermath of Twitters big data divisionGNIP announcing that it would no longer makefirehose reseller agreements with third parties, Twitter has provided an update on how one of its firehose licensees is being affected. In a blog post in Japanese, Twitter confirmed that NTT Data, which resold Tweets and their metadata in Japan, will indeed no longer have firehose reselling rights come August (as we reported first over the weekend). But it also pointed out that the relationship is not ending altogether: the two are now working onenterprise services.NTT Data has been and will continue to be a very close and strategic partner in Japan, the company wrote in the post. Our two companies are working together now on transitioning NTT Data from being simply a data reseller to a far more strategic solutions partner based on the strength of NTT Datas breadth and depth of expertise in social analysis, systems integration and business insights.A full translation is below.A Twitter spokesperson confirmed tous whileNTT will no longer have the firehose to resell, it will transition into a partnership with Twitter along the lines of what the social platform has with IBM. That deal, originally announced in October 2014, was made to let enterprises incorporate Twitter data into their decision-making through an established set of IBM tools, solutions and consulting services.The two finally turned on the first of those services in March 2015: a set of data analytics services and developer tools that run onIBMs Watson artificial intelligence platform and its Hadoop platform, which will let developers write applications that utilise Twitter data.The fact that NTT and Twitter are not completely ending their direct relationship in light of the changes to firehose reselling policies could have been one reason why Twitter continues to list NTT Data as a key partner on its site.The reason that Twitter has provided an update today could have been to reassureNTT Datas customers for Twitter data  which includeNHK,RECRUIT Technologies KK,JR Souken Information Systems KK and theNational Institute of Informatics Information Research Center  that they will not be left high and dry, and to make it clear both to Twitters and NTT Datas investors that there will continue to be a connection between the two, along withall the value that this would imparton both companies.It looks likeDataSift does not have a similar kind of relationshipto announce at this point. It has published a fairly bluntblog post outlining the differences between what it offers to customers versus what they will be getting as a result of DataSift losing its firehose deal. It also noted that the reseller agreement that Twitter had in place with DataSift charged $.10 for every 1,000 Tweets received through the firehose  businesspaid for what they used. On average Twitters users produce500 million Tweets per day.Twitter Japans blog post translated below:In order to better serve our customers and partners after acquiringGnip in May last year, we worked to bring all data licensing activityin-house. We began this process nearly a year ago and will conclude it in August.NTT Data has been and will continue to be a very close and strategic partner in Japan. Our two companies are working together now on transitioning NTT Data from being simply a data reseller to a far more strategic solutions partner based on the strength of NTT Datas breadth and depth of expertise in social analysis, systems integration and business insights.We are very excited about the initiatives were working on together and will share those with you soon. In the meantime, our arrangementwill not change the way NTT Data accesses Twitter data. We will work together to best support each and every NTT Data customer that licenses Twitter data, and our teams will reach out to these customers together to help them make best use of our new and growing solutions relationship.The account transition from NTT Data to Gnip will be reviewed individually and each account is evaluated based on the use case of Twitter data.
