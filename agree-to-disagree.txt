THE LEGAL AGREEMENTS SET OUT BELOW GOVERN YOUR USE OF THIS TECHCRUNCH POST (TECHCRUNCH). TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS, CLICK AGREE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT CLICK AGREE, AND DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.A. TERMS & CONDITIONS ARE WAY TOO LONG SO THAT YOU DONT READ THEM AND JUST CLICK ACCEPTYou agree that you never read TERMS & CONDITIONS. Arent we right?There is no incentive to make these documents shorter as you dont want your users to pay too much attention to your TERMS & CONDITIONS. And there are new challenges today that make these TERMS & CONDITIONS even more obsolete (see paragraph C).Yet, if you are an astute observer, you may have noticed that Google needs less than 5,000 words to explain all its TERMS OF SERVICE and PRIVACY POLICY. This is another sneaky strategy. For instance, keeping things vague lets Google collect basically everything on your hard drive.We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches, Google writes.While the company gives us examples about how it plans to store data on your computer, it doesnt say what data it is going to collect.B. TERMS & CONDITIONS ARE WRITTEN IN IMPENETRABLE LEGALESE, INTENTIONALLY VAGUE AND HYPER-QUALIFIED LANGUAGE THATS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WTF YOU ARE AGREEING TO ANYWAYOops! Did you just agree to hand over your firstborn in exchange for using some free Wi-Fi? Faustian pacts have never been so in vogue, thanks to those little T&Cs.Spotify just updated its TERMS & CONDITIONS this morning with some very broad statements. The company talked about collecting your photos, location, contacts and more.The companys CEO Daniel Ek got into a Twitter fight with Minecraft creator Markus Persson over this update. Persson doesnt think Spotify should be able to access your photos on your phone.But Ek later clarified why the company needed to update its TERMS & CONDITIONS. If you want to add a custom image to one of your playlists, you can let the Spotify app access your photos and pick a photo in your camera roll. Spotify wont upload all your camera roll in a creepy way like Facebook and Google do  at least according to Eks statement.According to Ek again, its the same thing for the other types of data. You can let Spotify access your microphone for voice commands, your contacts to invite your friends to sign up to Spotify, etc.But should we trust Spotify? As you can see, the companys TERMS & CONDITIONS and PRIVACY POLICY are quite short. As a user, it can be scary as you end up agreeing to broad statements in these documents (see paragraph A). It all comes down on whether you trust a company and its CEO. In other words, TERMS & CONDITIONS have become useless as you can always misinterpret them.C. TERMS & CONDITIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN UPDATED FOR THE DIGITAL AGE  THATS INTENTIONAL, TOOIf youre buying a house, and taking out a mortgage, you should expect to read a lot of small print (doubtless printed out on actual sheets of paper  because thats how law firms typically roll). Purchases and service agreements rarely get much bigger than property-related transactions so such wordiness is understandable. But why should using a free weather app or setting up a new smartphone involve similarly lengthy and antiquated screeds for the tech user to parse?Consider this: how is the Internet of Things going to handle TERMS & CONDITIONS? If every device in your home requires you to read 2,000 to 10,000 words of conditions before you can use it thats a pretty big and unattractive road-block squatting on the smart home on-ramp.Add to that, lots of these connected devices wont even have a screen on them, so how will you read the TERMS & CONDITIONS anyway? Will your devices read them out to you via speaker, droning on in soul-sucking legalese all day and deep into the night in the background of your smart home as they toil electronically to insert all their conditions into your conscious mind? Or will they send them to your smartwatch so you have to spend every spare moment of your waking life flicking your wrist to wade through their never-ending texts?It doesnt have to be this way. If TERMS & CONDITIONS were designed to communicate the services scope and functions efficiently and effectively so that humans could actually understand: A) how it works and B) which bits of their data are absolutely required for it to function  these screeds could be cut down to size; even to just a few bullet points. Or, hey, why not even create some industry standard icons representing particular types of functions? Regulators take note!The problem is companies dont want to reduce the length of T&Cs because they are:
A) covering their asses and B) attempting to landgrab as much user data as possible to C) maximize their profit.So really, TERMS & CONDITIONS are an outgrowth of an even larger festering sore on the butt of the tech industry: data privacy.BOTTOM LINE: WE NEED TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE TO TODAYS TERMS & CONDITIONSIf your business model relies on:Then you are operating on borrowed time. Because the other biggest lie in the tech industry is that users dont care about privacy.Users have been lied to that their data is safe. And intentionally impenetrable privacy policies have encouraged them to just click I accept on your TERMS & CONDITIONS. But they are waking up to that lie. And claims that your service is trustworthy are going to ring increasingly hollow  not least as more and more apparently safe data leaks online, illustrating the extent to which technology has been allowed to exploit user data and undermine user privacy.So, which of those buttons do you want to click on now?YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE TECHCRUNCH SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
