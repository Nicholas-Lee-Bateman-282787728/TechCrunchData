Razer, the high-end gaming hardware firmheadquarteredin the U.S., made waves last year when it entered the billion dollar unicorn club courtesy of an undisclosed investment from Intel. Now its time to share the wealth  quite literally  which the company is planning to do viaa corporate venture capital fund that is slated to launch next year.CEO and co-founderMin-Liang Tan confirmed to TechCrunch that Razerisin the process of setting the fund up. Singaporean Tan  who wasspeaking at the launch of Razers newest concept storein Bangkok, Thailand  declined to say what size it willbe or be narrowed down on the kind of companies that it willback.He did revealthat the fund willact much like a global incubator in that it will allow companies to tap into Razers existing expertise and business which Tan pointed out, revenue-wise, is split evenly between North America, Europe and Asia. In addition, the company has10 offices located worldwide, manufacturing partners, and relationships with the likes of Intel, Tencent and more.The plan is really to find strategic companies that we can help and [that can]leverage off of our profile, he explained. Were really globally covered and can pretty much [assist them] before they even more into a new geographies or jurisdictions.Games and game-related businesses have obvious synergies, but hardware in general is a category that interests Tan.Pointing to a number of high profile Kickstarter projects that have run out of money lately, hesaid that the hardware business isreally hard but that, as a company that has scaled to produce and ship millions of units worldwide, Razer has the expertise, understanding and reach that could massively assist young and upcoming companies.Wecan [tell portfolio companies that]this is what we learned in this jurisdiction. For example, heres our European sales manager and they can talk to him.Hes not going to help you do your work, but hes sure as hell going to take you 70 percent of the way there by telling you what the pitfalls are. Weve got people on the ground who have been doing the exact same work [for years], he explained.Razer expects to have more news on the fund soon, with itlikely to come online and begin making investments sometime in 2016.The concept brings to mind Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, which routinely invests in promising hardware companies. In turn, Xiaomi provides them with access to its business network and Mi.com sales platform to help spur their development whileadding further products to its own sales line-up.While it has plans to begin investing, Tan declinedto discuss the possibility of an IPO or any other future exit plan for Razer.
