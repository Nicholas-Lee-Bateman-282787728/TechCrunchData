Even without a Prime membership, Amazon always offered free (and slow) shipping for orders over a certain minimum. For the longest time, that minimum was $25, but in 2013, the company raised it to $35. In its latest move to push its $99/year Prime membershipwith free two-day shipping, though, the company has now quietly raised this limit to $49.The good news: If youre buying books, the minimum to qualify for free shipping is still $25 (assuming those books are eligible for the free shipping promotion).For Amazon, this move also means thatit may be able to cutits shipping cost down a bit and increase its profit margins. In its last earnings release, Amazon said its fulfillment costs were up 32.8 percent year-over-year. Thats partly due to the expansion of its Prime Now service, but if Amazon can convince people to spend more per order, pay regular shipping costs, or sign up for Prime, that surely isnt going to hurt its bottom line.
