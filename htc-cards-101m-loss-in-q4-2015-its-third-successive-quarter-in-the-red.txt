HTCs (financial)struggle is real. The Taiwanese tech firmendured another rough quarter of businessafter itposted aNT$3.4 billion ($101 million) net loss for Q42015.Total revenue came in atNT$25.7 billion ($766 million), which is up nearly 20 percent quarter-on-quarter but down a massive 46 percent year-on-year.The phone maker bookeda slenderNT$0.47 billion (then $14.7 million) profit one year ago in Q4 2014, but this time around it is a thirdsuccessive quarterly loss following on fromaNT$4.5 billion ($139 million) lossin Q3 2015, when itstopped forecasting its own sales, and aNT$8.0 billion (US$252 million) loss in Q2.You will find [that] the product portfolio is streamlined and matched with the right cost of doing business, Chang said when askedwhat HTCplans to do differently this year.In a bid to find that right cost,HTC implemented a series of restructuring initiatives inthe latter part of 2015, which included laying off 15 percent of staff, andsome costs related to that are still being felt.Chang said that one further quarter of expenditure from restructuring will happen, so improvedfinancial results arent expected until HTCs Q2 2016, the company CFO added.HTC is putting a lot of emphasis on virtual reality (including its upcoming Vive product) and the Internet of things. Chang voiced his optimism that efforts in VR and wearables  where it is working with Under Armour, and just launched its first product  will be able to contribute to the bottom line in a meaningful way. Aside from being ambiguous, its tough to know how VR will play out in the consumer space  and in terms of sales  because it is so nascent and unlike other products on the market. What is clear, however, is that2015 was a disaster for HTC, and the company cant afford a repeat this year.
