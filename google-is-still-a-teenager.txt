Heres something that didnt pop up for me on Facebook. Happy Birthday Google! Or is it Alphabet? No, its Google. The search site now CEOd by Sundar Pichai is almost an adult..it turned 17 today. While even its founders arent exactly sure when the company was incorporated, this has been the day chosen to celebrate this year. Not a bad day either, after the announcement of a plan to bring millions of Indian residents online.Its our 17th birthday! Celebrate with some photos from Google's earliest days  http://t.co/Lq4Nc51s7c pic.twitter.com/n2RDyLbyLl Google (@google) September 27, 2015You might have missed the Google doodle to commemorate the birthday since theyre currently sporting an NFL-themed doodle on the site right now. It did however set up a page with some early BackRub Google memories.In the world of computer programming, 17 is widely considered the least random number.

Its Pichais first event as CEO, and an important one for the company. If Savage Garden shows up, though, Im leaving early.FYI, its also Meat Loafs birthday. Go ahead and read about other things that happened on this day in history with the rest of your Sunday.
