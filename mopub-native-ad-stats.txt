Twitter-owned mobile ad exchange MoPub is releasing some new numbers about the growth of native advertising.Native advertising is a fuzzy term, but it usually refers to ads that have been customized to resemble editorial or user content. MoPub allows publishers to create their own custom native ads, and although its been saying that the format is growing, its offered scant details.So heres what Twitter/MoPub is saying today: The number of apps in the MoPub Marketplace that use native ads has increased 8x between June 2014 and June of this year. eCPMs (the amount that advertisers are paying for each thousand impressions) are up 73 percent. And overall spending on native ads increased 387 percent.To be clear, MoPub didnt offer native ads to all its publishers until April 2014, so the rollout was probably in its early stages in June. Still, this suggests that the format has seen rapid growth during its first year-plus on MoPub.You can read more in this blog post.
