John Legere may have drawn the ire of the EFF and others for his networks controversial Binge On data categorizing feature, but the evidence so far has shownthat customers really are big fans of it (even if it is crappier quality due to data throttling). The service allows customers to watch optimized video from a number of streamingproviders without cutting into their monthly data allotment.Today, T-Mobile added support for a few streaming services that were notably missing from their selection of nearly 40 existing services. Online video addictscan now also streamAmazon Video, Fox News, Univision NOW, and their favorite wrestling moments for the WWE Network without cutting into their data plans.In addition to announcing the service expansions, T-Mobile also released data on how the service had affected customers data consumption and its pretty substantial. A study from the carrier finds that users are now streaming twice as much online video as they were before the Binge On program came about. The survey includes a lot of big numbers, the largest of which is 34 petabytes, the amount of online data that has been used to stream online video with the service for free.Binge On is our most disruptive Un-carrier move yet. It has literally changed the way millions of people are watching video  theyre watching more, more than twice as much as before, and most importantly, theyre watching without worrying about bigger bills or surprise overages! said John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile, in a blog post.Binge On is the Un-carrier solution to satisfy Americans growing appetite for mobile video  and the facts are telling us that customers love it!Binge On is opt-out and only available to customers with plans that includes3GB of high speed data or more.
