Tumblr today introduced a change to its service that will encourage users to purchase or fund products and campaigns on other websites, including Etsys online marketplace and Kickstarter, for example. With an update to its mobile application for iOS, posts that link to those sites as well as DoSomething.org will now automatically be given buttons that let others Buy, or Pledge, or Get Involved. These buttons appear at the bottom of the post itself as well as on Tumblrs dashboard, and in the case of the Buy button, also include the items price.The new feature appeared in the updatedversion of the Tumblr iOS application this morning, but does not yet seem to be live in TumblrsAndroid counterpart. [Update: we hear its going to show up on Android today as well.]The rollout is an expansion of tests Tumblr announced in late 2014, which then saw the company trying out the then-newfeature as a way togive its blog posts more interactivity on the web.At that time, Tumblr said users would see action buttons that appeared at the top-right corner of posts, allowing people tobuy, browse, pledge, or do something.There were four supported websites announced in December: Etsy, Artsy, Kickstarter and DoSomething.org. In todays rollout, however, Artsy is no longer mentioned, but its still included.In testing the new feature on iOS this morning, the new buttons would appear at the bottom of a blog post when viewed in Tumblrs mobile app, and, when tapped, would redirect you by way of the iPhones Safari web browser to the appropriate page on the site in question.Whats interesting, however, is that those same buttons didnt show up when viewing the blog directly on the web or mobile web by way of its direct URL. Theyre only visible when viewing the blog in the mobile app, or when scrolling through Tumblrs dashboard on either web or mobile.Our understanding as to why this is the case has to do with the fact that Tumblr blogs on the web have custom themes, so Tumblr doesnt always roll out new features as quickly to the whole blog network.On the dashboard, theyre located in the same position as before  the top-right corner on the web, or the bottom of the post on mobile, again as a small green button you can click to visit the Etsy page, Kickstarter project, or DoSomething campaign.While a relatively minor feature release for now, Tumblrs embrace of social commerce could potentially become more interesting in the months ahead if it chose to expand support beyond these still somewhat niche sites to include larger online retailers or marketplaces, like Amazon or eBay for example.It could also position the now Yahoo-owned blogging service to better compete against other social networking sites including Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, all of which have begun to experiment with Buy buttons or e-commerce functionality of their own.Facebook, for instance, began testing a buy button on News Feed posts and ads last summer, and Twitter soon followed with a Buy button that let you buy directly from tweets in the fall. Meanwhile, it was reported only last month that Pinterest would do something similar this year.The new featureis live now on iOS, here on iTunes.NOTE: Updated 3:15 PM ET to include more information on supported sites and Android launch.
