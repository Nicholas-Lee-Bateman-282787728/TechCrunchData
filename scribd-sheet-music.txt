Scribd continues to expand its selection  its adding sheet music for the first time, and also announcing deals to bring in Sesame Street childrens books and growits selection of textbooks.Scribd already offers unlimited access to a library of e-books and other content for $8.99 a month. Even though the company has been movinginto areas like audiobooks and comics, sheet music might not seem like an obvious addition. However, co-founder and CEO Trip Adler said sheet music is already a really highly searched-for term on Scribd.We want to be broader than just books, Adler added. We started with documents, we did comics, we see ourselves as being the library of the future.The companys first sheet music deal is with publisher Hal Leonard, adding 2,600 digital song books to the Scribd library. It covers a range of instruments (Adlers a saxophone player himself), difficulty levels and genres.The company alsosaid its adding thousands of textbooks from Elsevier, and will be introducing Sesame Street titles in the first quarter of next year.Its been a few months since Oyster (which was Scribds highest profile startup competitor) shut down, with many of its team members joining Google Play Books, promptingquestions about the viability of the Netflix for books-style model.As for content licensing (which can be a big challenge for online media services), Adler acknowledged that they represent Scribds biggest cost, but he doesnt see that as a bad thing.Weve been able to negotiate a lot of really great deals, he said. Weve been making it work pretty well Our goal is to make money for publishers and authors, and I think weve been doing that really successfully.
