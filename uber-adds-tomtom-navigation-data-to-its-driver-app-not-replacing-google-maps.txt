On-demand transportation serviceUber lost out on its joint bid for Nokias Here mapping unit, soits moving ahead with putting together its own navigation, mapping and location services. Today, Dutch mapping company TomTom announceda deal to provide data to Uber foruse in its navigationfor Uber drivers (and specifically notUber passengers). Specifically, Uber will use TomToms maps and traffic data that will contribute to the navigation experience, an Uber spokesperson tells TechCrunch.The companies describe the deal as multi-year and global, with a focus on some 300 cities. Neither are disclosing the financial terms.We are excited to provide Uber with our best-in-class location data. said Charles Cautley, Managing Director Maps & Licensing at TomTom, in a statement. TomTom is a truly independent map provider with the platform for the future. With this platform, TomTom is the trusted partner for innovative and future proof location technology for the global automotive and consumer technology industry.We look forward to working with TomTom, a leader in the mapping and navigation space, said Matt Wyndowe, Head of Product Partnerships at Uber. Their mapping and traffic data will help ensure we continue to provide a great experience for drivers everywhere.We have confirmed directly with Uber that TomTom will be providing data for the driving app alone. Itis not replacing Google Maps, nor any other services that Ubercurrently uses.Its part of the mix now, theUber spokesperson told TechCrunch. We use a variety of sources in addition to Google Maps, and will continue to. That mixincludes Ubers own mapping assets, which include itsacquisitions of Microsofts Bing mapping assetsand startup deCarta.(A potential separation from Google Maps was apparently the first question on many peoples minds in the wake of the announcement, according to one source at TomTom. Thats because many have highlighted how Googles own ambitions in transportation will put it into direct competition with Uber. This would be a complicated rivalry, given that Uber uses Google Mapsdata and is a big investment for Google Ventures.)The move to improve mapping data for drivers comes at a time when Uber is facing a lot of competition from a wave of other app-based on-demand transportation services, many of them focused on more local markets than Uber andits global footprint.For drivers who work on contract in their own vehicles and are beholden to no specific service, having an app that is more accurate and efficient in terms of getting them from points A to B and providing the most solid location information could be a tipping point for them in deciding which service to drive for.TomTom provides mapping data for its own range of GPS-navigation hardware, but it also works with a numberof third parties, with its data especially strong in urban areas.Perhaps most famously, it started to workwith Apple as one of several partners on its native Maps application after Apple ditched Google in favor of its own in-house data and service.Shares for TomTom, valued at around 2.44 billion ($2.6 billion), were up over 5% in morning trading after the news came out.Little sidenote: Uber already has a team in Amsterdamworking on the companys global mobile apps, making the integration process potentially a little easier. Geography, however, apparently wasnt what brokered the deal in the first place.
