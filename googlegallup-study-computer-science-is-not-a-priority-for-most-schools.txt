Nine in 10parentsbelieve that teaching computer science is a good use of school resources. Two-thirds of parents believe CS education should be mandatory in schools. Eighty percent of students think they will learn about CS in the future. Three out of four principals say their schools offer no CS coding or programming classes (and for reasons I cant quite fathom, lots of schools apparently offer CS classes that dont involve programming).Something isnt quite right here. As a newGallup poll commissioned by Googleshows, were still a long way from being able to assume that virtually every school teaches CS, even as parents and students increasingly expect schools to do so.For administrators, CS is simply not a priority. When 91 percent of parents want their children to learn CS and only 8percent of administrators believes there is demand from parents, theres clearly an issue somewhere.Theres a critical need to address the lack of awareness about student and parent demand for computer science, lack of support for CS teachers, and competing priorities that prevent computer science education from being offered, Googles researchers write today.Schools argue that they simply dont have the time to devote to CS classes (thanks in part to the ever-increasing testing requirements they have to fulfill, which dont include CS) and thatthey have no budget for computer science teachers (which are also hard to find, given that the best coders likely wont want to work in education).When schoolsdo offer CS classes, many of them dont involve programming, which seems rather odd. About half of the principals who say their schools offer CSclasses say that programming isnt part of the coursework. Maybe you can teach students about the theory of algorithms on a blackboard, butwhats the point of that when the students never get to put that knowledge to work?You can find the full report with even more disappointing stats about the state of CS education in U.S. schools here.
