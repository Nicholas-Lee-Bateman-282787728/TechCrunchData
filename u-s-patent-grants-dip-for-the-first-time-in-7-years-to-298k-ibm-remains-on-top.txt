As patent reforms continue to move slowly through the legislativesystem, the number of patentsbeing awarded has declinedfor the first time in seven years.The U.S. Patent and Trademark office issued298,407 utility patents in 2014,according to a new report from IFI Claims. As a point of comparison, last year the research group tracked 300,678 utility patent grants. IBM remains the leader with the most patents filed, although its numbers are also down: 7,355 patents in the2015 table versus 7,534 a year ago.Despite the declines, the numbers are down by only less than one percent versus a year ago. In other words, if we are seeinga less heated view of patents and their effect on business (or alternately, how they may negatively impact innovation), its still a minor one.After seven straight years of prolific patent growth, 2015 saw the first sign of de- acceleration, said Mike Baycroft, CEO, IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, in a statement. I wouldnt suggest though that the patent train is losing momentum as many companies continue to crank out more patents than the previous year. That historic seven-year run was remarkable especially when you consider that IBM, Samsung and Canon each generate more than twice as many patents now as they did a decade ago.Indeed, when it comes to potential patents, the numbers are actually up. Applications for the 2015 tables are now at381,424. The 2014 tables noted 379,453patent applications.As you would expect, the top rankings in the list are dominated by tech companies. The top 10, in fact, are all tech companies:RANKAssigneeCCCount1International Business Machines CorpUS73552Samsung Electronics Co LtdKR50723Canon KKJP41344Qualcomm IncUS29005Google IncUS28356Toshiba CorpJP26277Sony CorpJP24558LG Electronics IncKR22429Intel CorpUS204810Microsoft Technology Licensing LLCUS1956Apple continued to hold on to number 11 with 1,938 patents filed (although down 3% on a year ago). Others advancing up the table includedQualcomm andGoogle both going up three places and Intel back into the top 10 after a year away, a jump of seven places.What IFIs larger top-50table, embedded below, doesnt really draw out are whether there are anytrends aroundwhat kind of patents are being granted  whether, for example, we are seeing a rise in autonomous vehicle-related patents or declines in patents that are related to mobile phones. In a way, this could be a more accurate marker of where innovation is focused at the moment.What the IFI does point out are the top 10 classifications for patents (which the USPTO is standardizing on the international cooperative patent classification system):It notes that grants in thebusiness methods patent class declined to8,828 from 11,690 in 2014. IFI cites the2014 Supreme Court decision in the Alice Corp. vs. CLS Bank International, which tightened the rules on which business methods are patentable. The impact of the decision can be seen in the drop in G06Q patents, it writes. This is a good sign for those who are hoping for more legal precedent and how it impacts patent reform in other areas.IBM in a separate release about its patent leadership points out that its patents covered various areas like AI, machine learning and natural language processing and cloud platform technology  all areas of the market where its looking to do more in general.Some other notable details: Amazon made one of the more impressive jumps, from number 50 to number 26 (with 1,136 patents)  another sign of how the company has tried to shift away from its e-commerce roots into a whole different range of businesses from cloud computing to mobile services and new hardware.Another trend IFI has drawn out involves how some larger companies are spreading their patents across multiple entities. In fact, the Microsoft Technology Licensing that appears as number-10 in the list below was ranked 979th a year ago. Microsoft Corp. meanwhile, which was ranked fifth last year, this year took only 458 patents.Similarly, Panasonic Intellectual Property Management Co Ltd at number 18 was 971st a year ago. The vast majority of Googles patents are going to Google Inc. but there is another entity called Google Technology Holdings LLC. Its not clear exactly why these are now getting split, whether for litigation or other purposes. (Were going to try to find out and update this with an explanation.)Top 50 list below.
