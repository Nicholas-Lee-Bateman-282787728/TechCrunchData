Verizon may be moving closer towards purchasing Yahoos main Internet assets. According to a new report in the Wall Street Journal, the telecommunications giant wants to make a $3 billion second-round bid for Yahoo.TPG, a private equity firm, also plans to submit a bid. Second-round offers are due by Monday and WSJs sources say Yahoo will hold at least more round of bidding. Verizon is currently seen as the leading contender after other potential buyers (including Time Inc., Alphabet, Comcast, AT&T, and IAC/InterActive Corp.) dropped out before the first round of bidding in April.(Disclosure: Verizon owns AOL, which in turn is TechCrunchs parent company).The $3 billion offer Verizon is expected to make next week is lower than the $4 billion to $8 billion bids that Yahoos Internet business, which includes its news sites and ad business,
reportedly garnered during its initial bid cycle. The WSJ reports that this is because a sales presentation last month by Yahoo chief executive officer Marissa Mayer revealed that its online businessone of the main reasons Verizon is targeting an acquisitionis slowing.Weve contacted Verizon, Yahoo, and TPG for comment.
