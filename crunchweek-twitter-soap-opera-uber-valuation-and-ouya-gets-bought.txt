Its time for CrunchWeek again!What a week it was.The Twitter soap opera continues with earnings, no new CEO, hashtags and more. Uber keeps raising money until we lose count. Ouya gets put out of its misery bought.As Alex would say: Its Friday, its CrunchWeek, its time to throw down and talk some smack.
