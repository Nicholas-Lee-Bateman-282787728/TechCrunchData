It seems that Adele, an artist that I love nearly as much as Metallica  and that is my highest possible praise  will not stream her new album on Spotify. This has made me quite sad.In honor of Adele, our Overlord of Sad and Grand Dukeof How Did You Sing That, TechCrunch has adapted, poorly, a verse and chorus from her hit single Hello forour own needs.Yes, yes, yes, it isnt great. But we were in the office, so here we are [Original lyrics via Genius]:Hello, Its me  I was wondering if after all these years  Youd like to not hear my new album  They say that times supposed to make you smarter  But I aint done much learningHello, can you hear me?  Im not on Spotify where you hoped Id be  When we were younger and free  Ive forgotten how it felt to have the world fall at my feet  There such a difference between us  About a billion streamsHello from the other side  I must have lost a trillion streams  But Im not sorry, for everything that Ive done  When I sit on the physical shelf youre never home  Hello from the outside  Where you dont really go, no  I tried to tell you Im sorry for breaking your Apple Music  But it dont matter, cuz you put on some other musicThe album has already leaked. We are not going to link to that, of course, but here is a decent run-through of the tracks that it contains.Please bring the new tunes to Spotify. Please.
