Now that SoundCloud has inked licensing deals with all the big music rights holders, the startupis wasting no time rolling out subscription servicesand advertising to a wider number of markets to better monetizeits 175 million users andcompete better against the likes of Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music and the rest.The music-streaming company  sometimes referred to as the YouTube of audio for its wide array of user-generated content  is today expanding itsSoundCloud Gopremium subscription service to the U.K. and Ireland, a month after firstlaunching it in the U.S.As with the U.S. version of Go, users will have ad-free access, plus a Spotify-style selection of millions of premium tracks alongside the wider SoundCloud catalog of music and podcasts  some 125 million tracks in all for a fee of9.99 or9.99 per month after a 30-day free trial (the U.S. version costs $9.99 per month).One month from the launch of Go, SoundCloudis not giving awaymuch about how it has been received so far in the U.S., the only market where ithas launched so far. The overall feedback is extremely positive, and were hugely excited, was the most thatEric Wahlforss, SoundClouds co-founder and CTO, would say in an interview. Of course, there are likely a lot of people who have signed on for the free trial, so it will be a waiting game to see how many stay.Atthe same time, to pick up more audience, Wahlforss saidSoundCloudis looking for ways of leveraging its social media credentials. (On SoundCloud, in addition to being able to follow people, you can tag tracks with yourown insights and respond tocomments from others, creating a kind of conversation unique to the platform.)The company has been working with Twitter to makeaudio content playablein-stream (most recently, SoundCloud started working in Twitter Moments).And Wahlforss also brought upSnapchat as a super interesting company for being very real time and authentic, how we want and like SoundCloud to feel as well, and for being compatible in another way, too: There arevery few companies that have over 100 million uniques with a lot of themmillennials. SoundCloud and Snapchat both do.No commenton whether the two are working together, butthis sounded like a very strong hint that if they are not already, SoundCloud wants to be.And for those who opt to listen to SoundCloud for free, brace yourselves for ads of many formats.SoundCloud saidthese will include audio spots; in-stream native ads; promoted profiles; and creator partnerships. I asked SoundCloud to clarify what native ads will look like and it seems that native in this case will not necessarily bea revival of advertising jinglesby musicians.Brands are choosing either existing tracks from creators or may be able to inspire a track, but it wont be a direct endorsement, a spokesperson told me.Regardless, themain idea, it seems, is to not just put in more advertising, but to do it in a way that ties in the artists themselves  12 million and counting onthe SoundCloud platform today  so that if they choose, theycan use adsas an extra revenue stream alongside whatever royalty deals they may have in place around their actual music and other audio content.Alongside the ability to track music and choose what tracks are part of SoundClouds free and paid tiers, the ads become something that artists can also control. The introduction of advertising will ensure listeners can continue to experience SoundCloud for free, as well as offer creators the opportunity to be paid for the work that they share, the company noted.This is also an attempt to respond to awider issuearoundstreaming services like SoundCloud (and others), which have been criticized and shunned by some artists who believe that they are not getting paid fairly for their work.Ads and subscriptions areSoundClouds latest efforts to generate revenues, after initially starting out with SoundCloud Pro. Aimed at creators rather than consumers, Pro comes in two tiers of $7 and $15 per month and gives people the ability to upload more than the standard 12 hours of audio, plus analytics and morecontent controls.About SoundCloudSoundCloud, the worlds largest music and audio platform, launched in 2008 by Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss, lets people discover and enjoy the largest selection of music from the worlds most diverse creator community.
