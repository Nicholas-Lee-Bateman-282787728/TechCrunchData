Fifty seven thousand Marvel movies later, you know the deal: Thor has a hammer (called the Mjolnir). Only he can pick it up. To pretty much anyone else, even those who are theoretically stronger than him, its impossibly heavy.Bringing the concept to life, someone has built a Mjolnir that only its owner can lift. How? MAGNETS!Though not obvious at first glance, theres a fingerprint reader in the hammers handle wired up to an Arduino Mini, a big ol battery pack, and a powerful electromagnet. Sit the faux-Mjolnir on something magnetic  like, say, a big metal plate in the ground  and it locks in place. When the aforementioned fingerprint sensor detects its creators prints, the magnet releases and the Mjolnir can be lifted. Otherwise, it wont budge.(Well, most of the time. Props to the guy at the end of the video who out-clevers the crazy clever creator. I wont spoil how.)Dig this sort of thing? Check out these custom auto-extending Wolverine claws.
