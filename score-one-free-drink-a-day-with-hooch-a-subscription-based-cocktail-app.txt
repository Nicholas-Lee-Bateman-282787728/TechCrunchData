Hooch, which just launched in LA, is a subscription-based app that gives its members one cocktail every day for just $9.99 per month.Yes, were being serious. For less than the price of one cocktail, you can get a drink each and every day at your choice of dozens of bars around New York or LA.But how could the company possibly be making money?Essentially, the service acts as a promotional tool for bars.Instead of paying thousandsof dollars in traditional advertising, Hooch lets establishments offer guests a first drink free, with the hope that they will stay and rack up a hefty bar tab.And according toLin Dai, CEO and Co-Founder of Hooch, its working. Members on average are spending an additional$30-$40 per visit after receiving their complimentary round of drinks at Hooch partner bars, and up to $140 per check at participating restaurants.Lin notes that users are currently redeeming an average of 16 drinks a month, which is pretty incredible engagement.Whilecontinually adding new bars and restaurants is going to be key to sustaining this engagement,it shouldnt be too hard to sign up new establishments now that the concept is proven.The main goal ofhospitalityadvertising is to get the customer in the door, and nothing does thatquite as well as simply offering customers a free drink.Plus, while Hooch is currently focused on just drinks, its not hard to envision a future wherethe platformcaters to the entire hospitality industry,offersfree appetizers at restaurants or room upgrades at hotels.The company has raised a $1M seed round from angels in the hospitality industry, as well as friends and family.Hooch is live in LA, New York, and expanding soon to Austin and Miami. It can be downloaded from the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.
