Its been a while since weve heard much from Nest  they bought Dropcam, then went a bit quiet.Today, theyre breaking the silence at a press conference in San Francisco. The first new product out of the gate: a second generation of its smoke alarm, the Nest Protect.So whats new?Heres what we know so far:Externally, the device looks about the same. Internally though, a bit has changed: theyve tweaked some of the curves to help smoke flow into the device more efficiently for faster detection, but added a mesh filter to keep bugs from poking their way inside.
