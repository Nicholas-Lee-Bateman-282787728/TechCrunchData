Back in October 2014, Nintendo went off on a health tangentwhen it announced plans to develop a sleep and fatigue tacking app that would helpoptimizeyourslumber time.Nothing much had been heard about the project since, until yesterday, that is, when the Japanese games giant confirmed it has been putto sleep indefinitely.We were certainly intrigued by the device, which was unrelated to gaming, when it was revealed.Roughly the size of a hand, it was designed to sit on a bedside table from where it would usemicrowave sensors to monitor sleep data throughout the night. That datawould then be analyzed to provide pointers on how to a user could improvetheir sleep and rest cycle.Those plans and design dont really matter now.Wired reportsthat Nintendo PresidentTatsumi Kimishima confirmed that the quality of life device has been canned, althoughhe did addthat Nintendo isnt ruling outother projects in the health space in the future.Wiredtranslated the following quote fromKimishima,made at a Japanese language Q&A with investors following Nintendos Q3 2015 earningsreport:In regards to the Quality of Life [device], which was not mentioned in any of todays questions, we do not have the conviction that the sleep-and-fatigue-themed [device] can enter the phase of actually becoming a product.We no longer have any plans to release it by the end of March 2016. On the other hand, we still believe there are things we can do in the general category of Quality of Life, and we will continue to study the possibility of expanding into this field.Nintendo has plenty of other activities to keep it busy this year. Not only is it (finally, FINALLY) venturing into mobile apps and games, but its next-generation console is due for release in the second half of 2016. Lots to look forward to, but for now that wont includehelping you rest up.
