Editors note: Ashish Krishna is a co-founder and designer at Mammoth.Im in the car of my co-founder Karan Gupta driving to a brewery in San Francisco. Im thinking we are all going to get drunk  reallydrunk. Wishfulthinking. Its past midnight, Im sober as ever and Im emailing angels, founders and VCswe met earlier in the day. Life of a founder. But hey, Im not complaining!All theAP 8 companiespitched earlier this afternoon and everyone killed it. It was so much better thananything that anyonepresented just 2 weeks ago. Everyone was happyinvestors,Thomas Korte,CarineMagescas(henceforth TKCM), andourselves.The sheer progress a startup makes in 12 weeks ofAngelPad is nothingshort of stunning. The format is straight forwardTKCM, 1214 startups, a co-working space in NYC, a coffee maker andVictor (TKCMs adorable son). You work like crazy (pushing14- 16 hours/day) for 12 weeks, make very good (founder)friends along the way, gather tons of startupknowledge, and prepare to raise $1M+ in seed money. Let me tell you moreabout how.The StartTKCM know that its still early days for all the startups in the batch. But, if you got into AngelPad youmust have been doingsomething right. The process forward is more than just about building momentumfor demo day. They know that at this stage,the founders need to make decisions about what kind ofcompanies they want to buildtheir vision, their business, theirculture, their values, their hiringstandards, and more. Each of these layers is tackled to put into practice with advice and time.Weekly ScheduleIn the first week of AngelPad, TKCM tell you theyll roll up their sleeves and work with everyone. Theyreally mean it.Monday morning starts early, where they set the course for the week: how many times they will meetwith each company,points to focus on, upcoming talks, and more. Mondays end late with beer, pizza, anda long lecture session with Thomas.Both of them spend at least 30 minutes over the next couple of days in the week with every company,seeking updates on whatwas accomplished in the previous week, their feedback on how well youdid, and whatyou could focus on thisweek. Unlike a few other accelerators, its not one-size fits alladvice; its very personalized to you and specific to yourcompany. Youll be surprised how well theyknow, remember, and understand your business. As you continue at AngelPad,youll realize that theiradvice is spot-on.Rest of the week you work with your team on building and taking your company forward. Occasionallyyou take repeatmeetings with TKCM depending on your companys needs. Theyre around, and whileextremely busy, also available to you.Monday EveningsMany Monday evenings are AMAs with Thomas over countless beers where he fields dozens ofquestions from everyone andprovides insightful answers. Topics range from venture capital, business,sales, marketing, metrics, etiquettes, and justgenerally about the good, bad, and the ugly on startups. Allof this, in raw, unfiltered, and brutally honest form. Things yourarely get freely, from reading blog posts,hacker news, TechCrunch, etc. Its the inside dope from one of the most connectedguys in startup land.My 2 cents: If you do absolutely nothing else but listen to Thomas and retain only 20% of it, you stackthe odds up high in your favor for success.AssWhoopingA regular feature through all 12 weeks (yes, its institutionalized:) is TKCMs regular ass whipping weekafter week, posingreally tough, uncomfortable questions about your business, go-to-market strategy,market size, and what not. Most of thetimes youll have weird, made up answers, so beprepared to get anearful from Thomas.As demo day rolls closer youll realize that you and your startup have become so much more well honedthat not much scaresyou. Neither investor meetings nor the act of actually building a successful long-lasting business. Youll have figured outanswers to all the tough questions (team, market, product, vision,competition, traction), and be confident that you can learnwhat you dont know.Meet the FriendsAngelPad now operates from New York. But, you fly to SF every 3-4 weeks to meet with friends ofAngelPad. Who are these guys? I couldnt believe when I metWesley Chan(Felicis, ex-GV),Rich Wong(Accel),BryanSchreier(Sequoia),Dave McClure(500 Startups),Brendan Baker(Greylock),KevalDesai(InterWest),Tom Tunguz(RedPoint),Naval Ravikant(AngelList) andJeff Schox(Patents). Theseguys are rockstars, I used to follow them on Twitterand listen to them from afar. Suddenly they are therein front of you giving you candid, yet friendly feedback on yourcompany, market, and product. Plus, ifthey like you and your company, they might invest in you. Free advice (and funding) from gurus.Whats not to like?Yin YangLet me tell you more about Carine now; she is the perfect Yin to Thomas Yang. While Thomas getsincensed and yells a lotat you (in a good way), she is much calmer and more methodical. Youll alwaysfind her with a camera and a genuine smilethat will help you forget the ass-whipping you just got fromThomas.Her tips on body language, how to tell a story, present, talk, what to say, what NOT to say, what to writein a followup email(in your own words, not some cookie cutter template), etc. become more and morerelevant as demo day approaches. You feellike you know these things, but Carine proves you wrong timeand again with her amazing insight into strategy, presentationsand meeting skills  I realize it now, aftersitting through 35+ investors meetings.Co-working SpaceAngelPad also gives you an opportunity to work together and make friends withfounders from otheramazing companies.Youre always reminded by the Yodas:
You dont compete with each other; you compete with people outside.We worked together on several things, checking each others websites for typos, feedback on onboarding,proof-readingdecks, and practicing pitches. As weeks go by, youll come to know these super drivenpeople with very diverse talents whoare all available to help you with whatever you want. All you needto do isask.Alumni NetworkYoull also have an opportunity to meetAP alumniwho have raised everything from Seed, to Series A orB rounds. They giveyou incredible insight into the most asked question: how do I raise $X amount of money to build my company. Andsince absolutely nothing is official or on the records,theyre in their elements and share inside stories, talk about thecommits, and the screw-ups. Soak it in.You learn a lot, build relationships, make connections, and they potentially lead tointroductions toinvestors which are really helpful after demo day.Getting thereTwo weeks before demo day, TKCM ask you to stop everything else and just focus on your pitch andpresentation. You make anew deck everyday, present everyday and get your ass kicked everyday. But injust 14 days, youll see that your pitch has gone from 0 to Awesome. I just went through the first deck wemade and I wantedto throw up before I got to the end of it. TKCM make you tweak your presentationand story often. Theyve mentored over a100 companies, so they know what works and what doesnt.These two weeks are really gruelling and Carine helps youperfect your storytelling and branding; whileThomas is all about numbers, positioning and selling.Everyone repeat, 30 point font minimum, leave the bottom third of the slide empty and onlyone takeaway per slide.Demo Day and the AP BrandFinally the demo day. Its a big event attended by 150+ investors handpicked by TKCM. You might thinkthats the dayeveryone raises money, runs home with a $1.5M check and gets drunk. Nope, nothing likethat happens (I remainedcompletely sober, remember?). Fundraising becomes a full time job and you doit for next 810 weeks. Demo day is a bigbang event where you speed date with 3040 investors andschedule as many meetings as possible. You also get a stream ofinbounds and meetings with severalother investorsjust because you are part of AngelPad. Thats how influential theAngelPad brand is.AngelPad was the best thing that could have possibly happened to myself and Mammoth. And I think thatthe value I gainedfar surpassed what I could have hoped to get out of other accelerators. The maindifferenceface-time with an amazingcohort of founders and awesome mentors 24/7 (well almost).I would strongly suggest everyone whos thinking about startups and accelerators, to take a close look atAngelPad and applythere. It is super difficult to get inside  more than 2000 companies apply andTKCM personally cherrypick only 1214companies based on the application, video and 1:1 interview. Ifyou are hardworking, passionate and a bit lucky, youll get ona 3 month long bullet train, that you hopenever stops. Want to know more?
