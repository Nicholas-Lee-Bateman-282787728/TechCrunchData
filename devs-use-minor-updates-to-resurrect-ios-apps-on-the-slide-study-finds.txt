App updates are a strategic tool used bydevelopers to revive waining interest in their software and spark downloads. Thats one of the conclusions from a study by a group ofItalian academics looking at how app developers use updates to attract attention, and how effective this strategy is on Android vs iOS.Theresearch paper, entitledUpdates Management in Mobile Applications.iTunes vs Google Play, examinesperformance differences between app updates on Googles Play Store vs Apples App Store, with the researchers concluding that updates are a better way to drive app downloads on iOS than on Android.They looked at the top 1,000 apps on the iTunes and Google Play stores across five European countries over a period of six months.An update is more likely to be released when a developer observes a worsening of the apps performance, according to their findings.Our results confirm that updates boost downloads and are more likely tobe released when the app is experiencing a poor performance. We interpret this findingas evidence that app developers use updates as a bet for resurrection strategy, they write.Android and iOS developers release updates with what they characterize as an extremely high frequency, although updates are more frequent on Android  with apps on Google Play beingupdated on averageevery 28 days, andapps on iTunes being updated every 59 days.The authors suggestthat the lack of a significant impact generated by updates for apps onGoogle Play might be down tothe lack of any quality review process meaning both high and low-qualityupdates are published, and excessive updating of apps on Google Play effectively dilutes theimpact on overall downloads.When it comes to iOS apps, the researchers suggests developers useminor updates (such as bug fixes and small tweaks) as a strategic tool to boost app performance on the store  rather than majorupdates (with significant changes inapp functionalities), owing to the greaterdevelopmenttime and effort required to bake a major update.So an iOS app gettinglots of minor updates could be a sign of a developeracting strategically totry to combat waining interest.They note:We also find that a poor past performance of the appincreases the chances that the developer releases a minor update but has no impact on majorupdates. We interpret this result as evidence that only minor updates are used as strategic response to poor past performance.Other findings from the research include The research paper can be viewed here.
