Just in time for the start of baseball season, Apple has beefed up Siris knowledge of baseball stats, scores, and trivia.Siri can now do things like tell you Babe Ruths career batting average, the lineup of the 2008 World Series-winning Phillies,or even who won the World Series in 1934.Siri has also learned how to do league-level queries from 29 different baseball leagues, ranging from the Cape Cod League to Nippon Pro Baseball. While Siriwont support player-specific data from these leagues, she will return scores from all of them.While not necessarily an essential update, these new features are a fun way to get celebrate the return of baseball.Plus, they show off some of Siris more advanced natural language processing features.A phraseslike how many home runs did Babe Ruth have during his careeris probably something that would have previously returned Sirisdreaded heres what I found on the web.But, now the phrase returns an actual (and accurate) result, making Siri more human-like than ever.The features are live now, so grab your iPhone and see if you can stump Siri.
