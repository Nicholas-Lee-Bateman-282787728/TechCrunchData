The French data protection watchdog has ordered Google to widen its implementation of the so-called European right to be forgotten so that links are also delisted from all Google domains, includinggoogle.com, not just (asis currently the case) from the .fr French subdomain.Quick backgrounder here: the rtbf refers to a legal ruling by Europes top court last year. It identifiedsearch engines asdata controllers and required they process requests from private individuals wanting outdated, inaccurate or irrelevant informationdelisted from a search result for their name.Google, which is by far and away the dominant search engine in Europe, started processing these requests last summer. However the way Google implemented the courts ruling hascreated a trivial workaround because itonly delists linksfrom European sub-domains (such as .fr and .co.uk), not from google.com.Last November European regulators urged that link delisting should take place on the .com domain too. Google has ignored that guidance thus far, but the screw looks to be tightening ifnational regulators step up enforcement efforts.Today the French CNIL said it has put Google on notice to expanddelisting requests to all its domains, including .com. It has given Google 15 days to comply with its request. If Google does not comply it says it will initiate sanction proceedings.If Google Inc does not comply with the formal notice within the fifteen days the President will be in position to nominate a Rapporteur to draft a report recommending to the CNIL Select Committee (the Committee in charge of imposing sanctions in case of violation of the French data protection law) to impose a sanction to the company, the CNIL said today.The CNIL also notes it has received hundreds of complaints from individuals whose requests for delisting have not been granted by Google. After assessing thesecomplaints it says it has requested Google carry out the delistingof several results. And despite specifyingthe delisting should be effective on whole search engine, irrespective of the extension used, the CNIL notes that where Google has granted appealed delisting requests it has only done soon European sub-domains.In a statement provided to TechCrunch regarding the CNILs order,a Googlespokesperson said: Weve been working hard to strike the right balance in implementing the European Courts ruling, co-operating closely with data protection authorities. The ruling focused on services directed to European users, and thats the approach we are taking in complying with it.Google failed to respond directly when asked whether it will be expanding delisting to .com, in accordancewith the CNILs order.The companyhas previously argued that applying delisting to .com is unnecessarybecause only a very small percentage of European traffic goes to .com.Another option, thats not apparently on the table at this point but which might offer a third way between two clearly clashing positions, would be tooffer globallink delisting on a case-by-case basis (as posited in a recent research paper, covered by Slate), rather than having blanket requirements that search engines always delist globally,or a blanket refusal from search engines to offer anything otherthan partial (and thus trivially circumvented) delisting  which is the current impasse.The rtbf ruling has always beenabout striking a balance between any public right to know information, and a private individuals right to privacy. And given the inevitable variance involved in individual delisting requests then any general solutions  be it blanket requirements or blanket refusals  are always going to feel a little ill-fitting.
