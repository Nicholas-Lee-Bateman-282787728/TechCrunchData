Last week Apple released the latest iteration of its Shot on iPhone campaign. The newad was developed for Mothers Day, and features a slideshow of pictures and videos of moms and their kids.Now, a week later, Apple launched the aptly-named website momsshotoniphone.com,which lets youcreate a custom version of the ad that has a photo of you and your own mom.The site works on both desktop and mobile, and if opened on an iOS devicewill let you import a picture directly from your camera roll. Then, the site will churn out a 30-second clipthat mixes in your uploaded photo with the rest of the ad.After generating the video, Apple gives users the option to share it to their Facebook page, which is just another sign of Apple starting to embrace social media platforms likeFacebook and Twitter.One fun benefit of this is if your photo is semi-professional looking, you may be able to trick your friends on Facebook into thinking your submission was chosen for the official Apple ad. But, even if its not, you know your mom will be thrilled that you publicly postedhow much you care about her.
