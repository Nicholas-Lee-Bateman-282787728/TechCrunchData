The advertising and media world must havea weakness for industry visualizations  I probably hear aboutLumascapesseveral times a week.Now Mode Mediais making its own bid for Lumascape glory, with a new map of theonline video ecosystem.As you can see above, the company has divided the big, existingvideo services into different lands of control, including social networking, longform streaming and owned video (that last category is where YouTube covers most of the map).The map doesnt necessarily present any new info, but its a fun way to look at the landscape andconsider which services are truly competing with each other. For Mode, of course, its also a way to highlight its own growth in video  its literally putting itself on the video map.
