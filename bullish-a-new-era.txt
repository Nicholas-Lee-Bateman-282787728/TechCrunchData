After a short hiatus, Bullish has returned. The talk show is exactly how you remember it, exceptwith a new host (thats me, MRD!) andway better music. Sorry Im not sorry, Alex!Anyway, this week we brought in Matthew Schwab, president of on-demand flower delivery BloomThat, to shed some light on the on-demand economy, expectations around liability and delivery logistics. BloomThat, for example, initially handled the whole flower delivery process from end-to-end. The company eventually realized, Schwab said, that it didnt make sense to do that, so BloomThat ultimately decided to partner with local and national couriers, like FedEx, UPS and Deliv, a startup that offers same-day delivery services.We also chatted about just how on-demand the on-demand economy should be. In other words, howfast on-demand deliveries need to arrive.Where is that balance between the two-hour, four-hour window as compared to in forty minutes, Schwab told me on Bullish. And figuring out that balance I think is going to be really key in 2016.Its different depending on what it is a company is delivering, Schwab says. If its food, youre probably going to want it within the hour, but with flowers,same day in a matter of hours will probably be good enough.Hit play up top to hear more about tackling the on-demand economy.Bullish airs every Wednesday at 7 am Pacific, 10 am Eastern.
