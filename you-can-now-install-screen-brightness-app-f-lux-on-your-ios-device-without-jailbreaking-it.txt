Update:Well that was fast. F.luxs developers have pulled the downloadlink, sayingApple said the app was involition of the iOS developer agreement.When Applecombined their iOS and Mac developer programs a few months ago, the company alsoquietly dropped the requirement that you had to be a registered developer toload apps from Xcode to your iOS device.While Apples intention may have been to removethe financial barrier for new app developers, a side effect is that now anyone can download an open-source iOS app and install it onto their device.F.lux, the popular program that adjusts a computer screens color temperature in order to reduce eye strain during night use, has just taken advantage of this workaround by releasing an open-source iOS version of f.lux. Previously, you had to jailbreak your device in order to use the screen brightness software.So why couldnt f.luxs developers just submit their app to the App Store?Because automatically adjusting your iOS devices screen temperature requires the app to constantly run in the background, as well as use private APIsboth of which are against App Store rules.Apples stance makes sense, especially since private APIshave been known to do sneaky things like send users information back to developers servers. That being said,f.lux has been around for more than five yearsand is a prettytrusted open-source piece of software, especially within the developer community.You can download the Xcode project from the apps website, as well as view full instructions on how to load it onto your iDevice.Its definitely not as easy as downloading an app from the App Store (you still have to deal with Xcodes ever-frustrating provisioning profiles), but at least itsmore kosher than jailbreaking, as far as Apple is concerned.
