Sleeping with a cellphone in your room is, according to scientists who arent real, akin to sleeping with a radioactivity-emitting sleeplessness machine. Thats why artist and designer Ignasi Giro made JustTheBell.This box is quite literally just a bell. You set your alarms on via Bluetooth, leave your cellphone in another room, and go to bed. The box rings to wake you up and you shake it to snooze or turn it off, much like the alarm clocks of yore. In short, its just the bell.This is not the first quirky project by Giro. His Timeless Box was a simple box that opened at a preset time and he has made a number of other clever projects. He currently lives in Paris and works for TBWA.I cant stand it anymore: my girl and I chatting and mailing minutes before turning the light off, then waking up in the morning and 1st thing is turning the alarm OFF and then wifi ON and then jumping into mails and sms-es and whatsapps even before leaving the bed, wrote Giro breathlessly. Its too much. Does not feel that cool anymore :-( And thats a feeling we share with many members of the team here in Paris.The product is available for pre-order here and is handmade in France of solid beechwood. Early birds can grab it for a mere 50 and Giro will deliver next spring if he wakes up on time.
