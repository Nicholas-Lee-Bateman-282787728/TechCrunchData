Time to get nostalgic!Remember when The Internet Archive brought hundreds upon hundreds of classic console games online and made them playable in the browser? And when they did it again with hundreds of arcade games?Theyve done it again  this time with over 2,000 MS-DOS games. Lemmings! Wolfenstein 3D!Furthering the Internet Archives quest to catalog humanitys foray into digital, theyre now hosting an archive of 2,296 MS-DOS games, all playable (some more so than others) in your browser.Want to dodge dysentery on The Oregon Trail? Here.Want to relive all of the frustration of being completely sure you were lined up for that jump in the original Prince Of Persia? Heres that.Whereas the last few huge Internet Archive emulation projects have been powered by JSMESS (a Javascript system capable of emulating hundreds of systems and consoles), this latest addition is instead powered by EM-DOSBOX  an independent project that focuses solely on DOS. Project curator Jason Scott details that decision  and quite a few others  very well in a series of posts on his personal blog.While most of the games work pretty well, you dont have to look hard to find bugs  but considering that theyve managed to pull off the voodoo that is getting thousands of 20+ year old games to (mostly) work in your browser, lets try to be understanding.You can find the entire collection of games here, plus a few more bonus titles (Mario Teaches Typing! Commander Keen!) that have been highlighted separately for various reasons here.
