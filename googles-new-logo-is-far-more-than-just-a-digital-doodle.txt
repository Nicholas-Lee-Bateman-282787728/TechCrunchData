The more you see something, the more normal it becomes.Today, Google unveiled a new logo and branding.So far the public reaction is a mixed bag.Im sure that most of the people who spend time in Mountain View working for Google barely noticed itslogo anymore. It was on T-shirts, buildings, computers, stickers and everything in between.Of course,people dont like change. Butthen the surprise wears off and what changed becomes the new normal. (This progression doesnt include the whole Alphabet thingthat change hasnt sunk in for me yet.)Seeing Googles new logo in the wild makes it seem a little more normal than when its in a blog post or a promotional video. A little more human if you will:Having been through a logo change at an iconic Internet company Yahoo  I can say that swapping these things out is quite anundertaking. Think of every single property that a company of this size has stamped its logo on. Luckily, Google swapped in a flatter version of its logo in 2013, so it had recently gone through this exercise.Its not easy, though. Every building, every app, every page, every piece of schwag, every blog has to get changed (and 5,000 things that I cant think of at this moment). Its not like Google woke up and said hey, lets change our logos today. I bet there was a good 3-6 months of planning for this at least.I mean, making sure to swap out the favicon is a huge deal when doing something like this.Whens the last time that a Googler actually thought about itsfavicon? Wild.This isnt the end. Well be talking about this very topic again one day. The next time Google changes its logo, to be precise. Dont tell all of the people who were involved in changing out the logo this time, thoughthey need a mini-vacation after this.
