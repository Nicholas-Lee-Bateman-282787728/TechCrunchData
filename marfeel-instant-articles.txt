Marfeel, a startup that helps publishers adapt to mobile, now supports publishing Instant Articles on Facebook.That might not sound like a big breakthrough  basically, it just means Marfeel can repackage articles forFacebooks new, native publishing format. However, it illustrates todays mobile strategy means much more than just creating a mobile website or app.We are actually a 360-degree solution, said Marfeel CEO Xavi Beumala. This is part of what weve been doing  making publishers content available across any channel where audiences can be.Publishers can use Marfeel to incorporate Instant Articles as part of their broader mobile strategy (the company alsoadded support for Googles Accelerated Mobile Pages project in February) so they can see how Instant Articles perform, and monetize, compared to articles elsewhere.Being that most of our traffic is driven by social media, the solution Marfeel has delivered for easily getting up to speed with Facebook Instant Articles is a huge advantage, saidRichard Metzger, publisher of the pop-culture website Dangerous Minds, in a statement. Its allowed us to integrate Instant Articles into our mobile site simply and smoothly. And whats more, it carries our existing monetization strategy over to Instant Articles, allowing us to avoid what otherwise would have been a painful process.
