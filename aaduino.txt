The hardware tinkerers and prototype mavens out there will invariably have stumbled across the Arduino platform. Completely open source and always pushing the limits for collaboration, there are a ton of different development boards available, but none are as awesome as Johan Kanflos AAduino. Behind the delightfully punny name, youll find anArduino-compatible board the size of an AA battery.Growing up in the bad old days, youll remember what an epic pain in the rear-end it used to be to get started with electronics and embedded circuits. That all went away when the Arduino team sprinkled a generous helping of user-friendliness across the proceedings, making it easy to (re)program the processors, and using a Java-clone and an easy-to-learn IDEmade it ridiculously easy to develop software for hardware applications.Based on theTiny328, AAduino takes the platform to its sexiest form factor yet: Turning a three-AA battery holder with two batteries in it the third battery compartment holds the AAduino  into a powerful, yet diminutive computing platform that fits in the palm of even the smallest hands.Two AA batteries and an AAduino side by side, in a display of effortless cool we havent seen this side of Hollywood in a decade.If you want to get your hands dirty and build your own, Johan has embraced the spirit of Arduino fully, and made schematics and all the other fun things you need availableon GitHub.
