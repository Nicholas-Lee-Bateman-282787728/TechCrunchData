Update: Teslas stock price had briefly bounced back, but now isdown againabout 6 percent during the earnings call.Today after the markets closed, Tesla reported secondquarter financial results, including non-GAAP revenue of 1.20Billion and non-GAAP lossper share of $0.48 cents. The street expecteda non-GAAP loss per shareof $0.60 on non-GAAP revenue of $1.17 billion.Already announced about a month ago, the company delivered 11,507cars this quarter, after delivering 10,030 in Q1. This quarters delivery number beat the companys outlook, which was between 10,000 to 11,000.However, the company reduced delivery guidancefrom 55,000 cars to between 50,000 to 55,000 cars. This is a reduction on Tesla CEO Elon Musksgoalof 55,000 cars delivered in 2015, which would bea 70 percent increase over 2014 deliveries.In its shareholder letter, Tesla explained the estimate reduction:We are still testing the ability of many suppliers to deliver high quality production parts in quantities sufficient to meet our planned production ramp. Since production ramps rapidly late in Q4, a one-week push out of this ramp due to an issue at even a single supplier could reduce Model X production by approximately 800 units for the quarter. Furthermore, since Model S and Model X are produced on the same general assembly line, Model X production challenges could slow Model Sproduction. Simply put, in a choice between a great product or hitting quarterly numbers, we will take the former. To build long- term value, our first priority always has been, and still is, to deliver great cars.  Elon Musk, CEO and Deepak Abuja, CFOThe company also announced that it manufactured 12,807cars this quarter, which is about 2.5percent betterthan its guidanceof 12,500.
