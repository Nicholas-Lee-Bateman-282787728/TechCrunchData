MagBak, the company that makes what it claims is the worlds thinnest mount for the iPad, has now turned its attention to the iPhone 6. The MagBak Case has far surpassed its $15,000 goal on Kickstarter with about $130,000 raised and nine days left to go in its campaign.The MagBak for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which starts at $39 and is scheduled to ship next month, has two parts: a case made from layers of microfiber, polycarbonate, and silicone embedded with magnets, and thin aluminum sticks that adhere to surfaces with a 3M adhesive strip.Like the MagBak for iPad, the MagBak Case is a very simple but elegant and unobtrusive alternative to other mounts for the iPhone, which usually require you to install a bulky holder. The cases magnets are arranged so that your iPhone automatically aligns to its aluminum mount (or another magnetic surface) in portrait or landscape modeIve enjoyed using a MagBak on my iPad Air, which I often stick on my fridge to look at recipes or watch shows while doing chores. The silicone surface is also very comfortable to grip, though a drawback is that some of my MagBaks magnets have escaped from underneath its edges. This looks like it will be less of a problem on the MagBak Case, however, since it enwraps the entire iPhone and has more layers than the iPad version.For people who might be leery of carrying an iPhone wrapped with magnets next to their credit cards, MagBak founder Alex Baca says that hes tested the case to make sure it wont damage your plastic.To be able to affect the magnetic strip on a credit card, a much stronger magnet concentrated in a smaller surface area would be needed. The magnets embedded in the MagBak Case are spread out and isolated by a layer of silicone. This layer of silicone is designed to keep the magnets isolated/distant when in contact with non-metal objects, but to compress when in contact with metal surfaces or other magnets for more secure mounting, he explains.MagBak is also working on a version of its case for iPhone 5 and 5s.
