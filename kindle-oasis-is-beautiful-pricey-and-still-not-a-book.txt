Ive spent the last week trying to pretend the new Kindle Oasis is the same as reading a real book. Its not.I love books. I love Kindles e-readers and was hoping this was the melding of the two.That real book feel was part of the inspiration for the latest Kindle in the family and why it comes with aprotruding one-sided grip handle able to flip from left to right to give it that book spine feel.But theres something about holding a real book in your hands, thumbing through and dog-earing the pages,underlining and making notes.Side view of Kindle Oasis. Super thin and comes with a handle for gripping like a book spine.You know your book, you know you can easily flip to the page with that one passage. You can spend your afternoon rapt in good literature, cupping the old books spine, smelling the dried parchment and traveling to far off imaginary places without moving anywhere at all.Kindle, unfortunately, isnt there just yet. But its getting closer.The new, radically different, squarish Oasis design is beautiful and arguably enticing as the newest shiny e-reader, but like older versions, the latest Kindle also has a lagging touch response  forget about easily thumbing through pages, writing in the margins or quickly pulling up another title. Too tedious.The visuals arent much better than the earlier Voyage, either with the same 300 ppiresolution  though it does have 4 extra built-in LED lights.And at a starting price of $290, compared to a$190 Kobo Aura H2O or iPad Mini 2 for $270, which does much more than an e-reader, it might be too much for most consumers.Though the e-ink display is easier on your eyes than an iPad and the added side buttons for flipping pages also seem to help speed up the process a bit.Oasis without the dual-battery cover.Heres where Oasis wins me over Travel.E-readers are better for hauling around than heavy books in general, but thelighter, slimmer, yet surprisingly sturdy Oasis is easy to throw in a bag  the molded polymer housing is made to take a beating  and can give you access to more than 4.4 million books through Amazons ever-expanding listof titles (up from 90,000 in 2007); along with a modest 4 GB storage on the device.The 60-day battery life (when hooked into the dual-battery cover system) also makes Oasis a great travel companion for long voyages.But Oasis isnt meant for everyone, just those most devoted to a luxury experience. Its niche, but a devoted niche of avid Kindle fans.While I like the upgrades, the difference is slight enough Im personally okay paying $90 less for the $200 Kindle Voyage.
