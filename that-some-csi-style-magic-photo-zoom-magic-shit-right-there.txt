Whenever I try to take a photo througha plane or hotel window, chances arethere are plenty of reflections that show up on the final image and ruin it. Now, however, Google and MIT researchers have found a way totake these photosand automatically remove these reflections and other obstructions.In a paper they will present at Siggraph 2015later this month,Tianfan Xue, Michael Rubinstein, Ce Liu and William T. Freeman show how you can takea short video sequence with your phone and then let their algorithms do their magic.Reflections, rain drops and fences mostly disappear from the final image. The algorithmslooks at the different images from the video and then figure out whats an obstruction in the foreground and whats part of the background. Others have tried this before, but none of their results are as good as what these researcher came up with.And here is where it gets spooky: because the algorithm has to detect the reflection in a window, for example, it can also create a clear picture of the reflection (or the fence  but most fences I have ever seen arent very interesting). Thats the kind of sci-fi stuff you usually see on bad cop shows (the kind where the technician can always zoom in on a license plate or reflection in a window, no matter the resolution of the image).Sadly, theres no word on when this will come to a smartphone camera near you.To fully appreciate this, check out the video below:
