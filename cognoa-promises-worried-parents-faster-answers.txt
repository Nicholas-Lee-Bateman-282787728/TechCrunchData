Theres alot of talk these days about computational medicine, which usesmassive amounts of data to train a machine to understand even more than experts or, at least, to identify health-related problems more quickly.Cognoa, a consumer-focused healthcare outfit, is among the developing fields biggest proponents. The two-year-old, Palo Alto, Ca.-based company claims it can dramatically speed up the time that it takes parents to identity whether their child has developmental issues, and it can do so by assessing far fewer data points than have been traditionally employed toward the same end.The companys story centers on the work of Dennis Wall, an associate professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Stanford who began looking intothe complexity of diagnosing Autism while an associate professor of pathology at Harvard several years ago. Specifically, he learned that theprocess of better understanding whether a childsdevelopment is on track typically means hours of behavioral examinations by certified practitioners whove been trained to perform interview-based analyses with parents or with children directly.As you might imagine, appointments are hard to get. In fact, the process is so slow, says Wall, that the average age of a child being seen by one of these practitioners is 4.5 years old. Thats notgood. By that age, a kid has missed a window of brain plasticity when an intervention can have the biggest impact.Work by researchers at The New England Center for Childrenwhich studied 83 toddlers diagnosed with autism in the schools Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention program underscores the problem. According to theirfindings, theres an alarming gulf between the impact that 20 to 30 hours of weekly one-on-one therapy can have on a child whos under age 2 and one who is 2.5 years old or older. While fully90 percent of the toddlers in theirstudy aged 2or younger made significant gains in social and communication skills, just 30 percent of children who entered therapy at age 2.5 or older made significant gains.Cognoa says it can get children in front of doctors faster with its deceptively simple app, one that asks parents to answer 15 questions that address a minimum viable set of behaviors that indicate whether their child is at risk of Autism.How can it boil down the process so drastically? The company says much of its power is rooted in the information that Wall has culled over the years, including from research repositories like the Autism Genetic Research Exchange, Cure Autism Now (later subsumed into Autism Speaks), the Autism Consortium, and the National Database for Autism Research, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health.Collectively, the repositories feature observations about 10,000 children. Its always been possible to request access to that information, says Wall, but he claimsno one before had tried tocombine, synthesize, and analyze thedata using machine learning.Of course, even iftrue, reducing the complexity of a diagnostic odyssey is one thing.Ensuring that parents receiveaccurate answers is another.On this front, Wall acknowledges that Cognoa is a work in progressbut he suggests its pretty far along. As he characterizes it, Cognoas is an adaptable system that can conform to new data to maintain high levels of accuracy and [provide] a quantitative score thats not binary but that fits a distribution curve, as does a childs weight or the circumference of his or her head.For those parents wanting more feedback, the company has ways to accommodate them, too, including invitingthem to take a short home video of their child in their natural environment. The film is then scored by analysts, andprocessed by Cognoas machine learning engine to generate an assessment. (Its much better than putting a child in a stark observation room with a person theyve never met and telling themto act typical, argues Wall.)Still,there isnt much Cognoa can do aboutone outstanding issue, which centers on doctorsavailabilityto treat developmentally challenged children.There is an access to care issue, acknowledges Wall.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Cognoa is working onit, he says. For one thing,he says Cognoa is already partneringwith leading childrens hospitals to triage lists and determine which kids need to be seen sooner. He says the company is also beginning to see outreach from general pediatricians who recognize they donthave the time they need to assess children. Not last, Cognoais starting to see majormomentum from moms and dads, more than 100,000 of whom have joined the platform and are now arming themselves with better information to present to their kids physicians.Were finding kids with the highest risk and empowering their parents, says Wall.We want to get these familiesactivated on reimbursable therapy as quickly as possible.Cognoa, which now has 10 full-time employees, has so far raised $5million in funding from Morningside Ventures in Hong Kong; Wall says the outfit is starting to talk with investors about its Series B round.
