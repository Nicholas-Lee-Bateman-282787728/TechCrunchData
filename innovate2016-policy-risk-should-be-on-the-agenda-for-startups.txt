When entrepreneurs launch start-ups, should they be thinking politically? Shouldpolicy risk shape their core products and strategies?Yes, they should  at least according to Dan Rosenthal, a senior staffer in the first Clinton administration and now a Principal at the global consultancy firm Albright Stonebridge Group.Entrepreneurs need to think about local regulations and policy landscape, Rosenthal insists. What he calls the Utopian view of the Internet as a single market has now, hereminds us, been replaced the splintered realities of our contemporary world.And disruption  while viewed positively in Silicon Valley  implies disturbance to many people outside the tech community.Its a timely message, of course, especially given the news from Europe over the last few weeks. And as Rosenthal implies, politicians are likely to shape innovation more and more as technology radically reshapes traditionally regulated industries like healthcare, energy and education.As always, many thanks to CALinnovates for their help in the production of this interview.
