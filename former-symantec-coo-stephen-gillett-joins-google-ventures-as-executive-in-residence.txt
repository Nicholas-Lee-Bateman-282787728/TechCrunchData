I hope to become a resource and mentor for the funds portfolio companies. Im also looking forward to being a student again, and learning from entrepreneurs who push the edges of technology and product.In addition to spending four years as the COO and board member of Symantec (and four years as CIOof Starbucks), Gillett currently serves on the board of Chipotle.While its not the usual EIR that we hear about, entrepreneur in residence, Gilletts vast experience will surely help younger companies navigate their way to both dealing with larger companies and becoming one.
