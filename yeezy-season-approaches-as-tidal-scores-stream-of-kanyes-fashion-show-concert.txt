Yesterday, Kanye West took to Twitter to announcethelaunch of both his new album and season three of his ultra-popular fashion brand, Yeezy.The brand will debut its latest duds and kicks at a star-studded fashion show concert today at 4 p.m. ETat Madison Square Garden in NYC.Want to see Ye onstage but didnt score that exclusiveinvite? Not to worry, because Westalso announced that the whole event will be live-streamed on Tidal.YEEZY Season 3. 2/11 4PM ET. @TheGarden. Livestream for ALL on TIDAL. https://t.co/flkoN5t26q KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 10, 2016While Tidal has previously streamed concerts, most have been restricted to subscribers only. However, Kanyes tweet emphasized that the stream will be open to ALL, which Tidal has also confirmed.Opening the event to the entire Internet is likelyKanyes way of continuing to makethe Yeezy brand more accessible to everyone. He has previously expressed discontent at how scarce his shoes have become withinsecondary markets, exclaiming that eventually, everybody who wants to get Yeezys will get Yeezys.Its also no shock that West chose Tidal to stream the event. Kanye is close with Tidal founder Jay-Z, and the two have previously collaborated on the 2001 album,Watch The Throne.P.S. If you need anything from Ye, please wait until next week to ask, because hes pretty busy this week with this whole artist/fashion designer thing.Please no one text me or ask me for anything till Monday.
