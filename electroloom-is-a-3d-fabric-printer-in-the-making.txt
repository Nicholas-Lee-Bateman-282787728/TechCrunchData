 3D printing is pushing into all sorts of areas, allowing for rapid prototyping of plastic and metal components, circuit boardsand even putting putting an alternative spin onfood production or offering a lower cost way toconstruct livingtissue structuresfordrug testing. Wellheres another big hope for the technology: wearable 3D printed clothes. (Not just the elaborate art pieces being currently createdout of jointed plastics.)Electroloom, a machine very much still in its infancy, is a prototype 3D printer that uses an electrospinning technique to turn a liquid (currently a custom polyster/cotton blend) into a seamless fabric  spraying the solution onto a shaped mold to create agarment without the need for assembling viastitching.The San Francisco-based team behind the machine call this process Field Guided Fabrication, noting they are using an internal electric field inside the printer chamber to guide fibers onto whatevershape they are trying to create.Because the 3D printed fabric is created from a multitude of tiny nano-fibers, they claim itsable to flex and drape in a similar fashion to traditionally woven fabrics. The idea being toform entire, customfitting garments without the need for extensive cutting and stitching  as todays garment industry requires.The Electroloom technology has been in development foraround ayear and a half at this point, and remainsvery much a work in progress, although the teamhas now launched a crowdfunding campaign with the aim of shipping a small number of alpha units (and a dev kit) to start getting outside feedback on the project.Were looking for people who want to use, explore, break, hack, and improve our machines, so that ultimately we can provide a more robust and reliable technology, they note on their Kickstarter campaign page.At the time of writing theyve raised just under half of a $50,000 target, with another 28 days of crowdfunding left on the clock.If they meet their funding goal, theyre aiming to deliver alpha units to Kickstarter backers by March 2016.The garmentsthey are currently able to print, such as the tank top and skirt pictured below, arent going to win any fashion awards. And their earlyfabric looks relatively thin  so probably isnt too warm to wear  so theres clearlya lot more development requiredfor the tech and theirtechnique to yieldtruly wearable clothes. But the potential for making clothes from sprayable fabricscertainly looks intriguing.
