SyndicateRoom, the U.K. equity crowdfunding platform that last week announced that the worlds first equity-crowdfunded Hollywood film hassigned Antonio Banderas to appear in its movie, has some big news of its own today, announcing a 3.1 million ($4.5 million) Series A from a number of heavy hitting angel investors.The round was led by Abcam founder Jonathan Milner, who noted he is excited about the companys superb leadership and a brilliant company culture.Unicorn AIM VCTwas the largest investor in this round, putting down a $1.4 million bet on the companys future.SyndicateRoom makes it easier for investors to invest in companies from idea to IPO.Of course, the company used its own platform to raise the money, but spectacularly overshot its target. The goal was to raise $3.35 million at a $36.5 million valuation, but the company smashed through that goal in less than 10 hours. This beats the companys previous record for its angel round about a year ago, when it raiseda $1.75 million round in around 33 hours.We are building aplatform for companies to raise equity investment at all stages of their equity journey, from idea to IPO, said Goncalo de Vasconcelos, CEO and co-founder of SyndicateRoom. To have such strong demand from both retail and institutional investors is the strongest vote of confidence we could have regarding our expansion plans within crowdfunding and equity capital markets.
