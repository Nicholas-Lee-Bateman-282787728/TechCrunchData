Editors Note: Omar Tllez served as the president of the public transit mapping service Moovit and sits on the companysadvisory board; he previouslyworked as anexecutiveat Synchronoss Technlogies.Ill always remember my first time at Ben Gurion airport.After a 12-hour trip from JFK, I was called to the front of the immigration line: Theguy wearing the Moovit tshirt, please come forward! For a second I thought Iddone something wrong and was going to get in trouble, but then the immigrationofficer said with a heavy accent Welcome to Israel! We are proud of our startupand want the world to know that we are a high tech powerhouse, as he gave memy passport and waved me off.I must have saved at least an hour in the line, butall I could think about was how excited I was to be in a country in which even theimmigration corps supported the ecosystem that I was part of, and, yes ofcourse, how glad I was that I had worn that t-shirt.No wonder they call it Start-up Nation I said to myself, as I took a cab to my hotel and wondered what otherthings I had to learn about this thriving ecosystem in Israel.Uri Levine, a good friend from Silicon Valley and Waze founder, had asked me tocome to Israel to check out two crazy guys that had done a soft launch of an appthat they claimed to be The Waze of Public Transportation. Uri was on theirboard, and thought they could use some help to take Moovit internationally.While I knew that the Israeli startup world was booming, I was blissfully unawarethat on a per capita basis, the Israeli high-tech and venture capital sectors werelarger than in any other country in the world. Whats even more surprising, Iwould later learn, is that the Israeli high-tech startup exit amounts increased by980% over the past five years to a record of $9.2 billionin 2014 (like Mobileye, Viberand Waze are examples of recent record exits).Sure, working with Israeli startups comes with a number of thrills, but there areplenty of learning curves as well.Their tenacious work ethos, their egalitarianand meritocratic idiosyncrasy, and their richness of diversity, are clear upsides ofbeing part of the Israeli start-up world.But, as with any other ecosystem thereare challenges that one will need to address, such as their very directcommunication style, the ability to work and be effective with 7-10 hour time zonedifferences, and their limited market and insularity which can impact their accessto capital.On the positive side, after several conference calls in which my Israeli team participated from bombshelters whilesirens blared, it finally became clear what the word chutzpahmeant. The funny thing is that Im not really sure Israelis see this as a big risk; itsjust the way it has to be done, no questions asked.I was awed by this and have to submit that since then it became increasingly difficult to accept thatmeetings in NYC were cancelled just because a couple inches of snow hadfallen. It is this tenacious ethos, one could argue, that has led over 70 Israelicompanies to be listed in NASDAQ, more than Europe, Japan, Korea and China combined.The Israeli Defense Force has created acountry in which sugar coating is perceived as offensive andwhere a healthy cynicism for authority is encouraged. If youre the type of personthat will blush or gasp, during a product review when someone yells, this isperhaps the most stupid idea Ive ever heard of! you definitely need to work ongetting tougher skin.While in New York or San Francisco, a comment like that froma manager wouldve likely generated an awkward silence and then scuttled themeeting, in Tel Aviv this is considered a great outcome, and building the skillsneeded to jiu-jitsu or channel that reaction energy will be extremely relevant.Inthe end,thisspirit pushes the teams thinking to generatebetter products. Also, to be fair sometimes Israelis are eager to discuss thingsjust for the heck of it, as if it were a national sport.Even walking into a bar on Tel Avivs Rothschild Boulevard, by far one of the trendiestcities in the Mediterranean, can be a weird experience. Ive counted up to sevenlanguages being spoken and several ethnicities present in a 2-meter radius.Smart, eager, tech savvy, native speakers of a variety of languages includingSpanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, and Russian,are always around. If youre a startup that aims to be in 45 countries and 500cities, in a 2-year period, then these international resourcescan come in extremely handy.Its no wonder that with over 4,000 startups in theGreater Tel Aviv area, Israel is ranked 1st in the world for innovative capacity in2014 by the IMD Global Competitiveness Yearbook.Getting used to long hours traveling and managing the side effects, comes withthe territory when working with Israeli startups. However hard I tried, for someunknown reason, it was impossible to soothe the jet lag when I traveled to TelAviv for board meetings.Similarly, being able to adapt to work in different timezones and managing the communication challenges to make the most out of it isvital when working with Israeli startups. Meetings that kicked off at midnight, inwhich we looped in San Francisco, New York, Paris, Sao Paulo, Madrid, Romeand Tel Aviv, were common. Preparing tight agendas and becoming masters withGoogle Hangout became a much-valued skill to address this challenge.While theres an abundant VC offering for A and B rounds in Israel, capitalavailability for larger rounds can be limited, and as such pitching to Sand HillRoad becomes a necessity.In fact, Dun & Bradstreet reports that theres onlytwo VCs in Israel with over $1billionin capital under management: Pitango and StarVentures. But while there are large VCs like Sequoia that have offices in Herzliyaand actively invest in Israel, to my huge surprise, there are others in the Valleythat take the, we do not invest in Israeli startups position.One clear pushbackthat we heard from these investors was how difficult it was for them toextrapolate success in Israel, with a population smaller than New York City, tothe rest of the world.In the end, the funny thing about Israelis is that theyll be the first ones toacknowledge that theyre hard to work with.In fact, theyll have a good loud laughabout it. They recognize that while their modus operandi can be perceived asabrasive, opinionated, free of bullshit and politics, it gets things done quicker thanmost.
