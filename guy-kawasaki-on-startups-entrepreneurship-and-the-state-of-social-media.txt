Zach Abramowitz is the co-founder and CEO of ReplyAll.One ofGuy Kawasakisrecurring pieces of advice to entrepreneurs is to create a mantra, not a mission statement.A mantra is three or four words that captures the essence of your organization e.g. Wendys: healthy fast food or FedEx: peace of mind.Guy even created a helpful mantra that sums up his career as the chief evangelist at Apple, nowchief evangelist at Canva, a venture capitalist, an advisor, a brand ambassador, a speaker and an author:empowering entrepreneurs.Guys advice isnt specific to tech startups, or even startups broadly speaking. I have personally recommendedArt of the Startto people launching everything from startups to non-profits, podcasts, bands and books.Over the past week or so, Guy was niceenough to give me some of his time to chat and answer a few questions about the startup ecosystem, entrepreneurship and the state of social media.
