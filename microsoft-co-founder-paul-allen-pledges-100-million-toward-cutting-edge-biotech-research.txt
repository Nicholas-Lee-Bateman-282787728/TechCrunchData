Investor, entrepreneur, billionaire andBill Gates other half in the founding ofMicrosoft Paul Allenhasannounced a $100 million investment in the Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group, a fund focusing on the future of biotech research.Allen, who is worth about $15.3 billion, announced the investment today at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.The purpose of this investment is to explore the landscape of bioscience and fund ideas at the frontier of knowledge to advance science and make the world better, according to a statement.To make the kind of transformational advances we seek and thus shape a better future, we must invest in scientists willing to pursuewhat some might consider out-of-the-box approaches at the very edges of knowledge, Allen said. Thisof courseentails a risk of setbacks and failures. But withoutrisk, there is rarely significant reward, and unless we try truly novel approaches, we may never find the answers we seek.The new Allen Discovery Centers will offer up to $30 million in funding ($20 million of which will be doled out over an eight-year period)and initially includes work with Stanford and Tufts University.The Allen Distinguished Investigator (ADI) program will offer a smaller amount of $1 million to $1.5 million each and will support early-stage research in conjunction with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), MIT,UC Berkeley (utilizing Jennifer Doudnas CRISPR Cas9 technology), as well as theInstitut du Cerveau et de la Moelle pinire in France.Focus areas for the first legof the funded projects include developingmethods to read and write code for tissue and organ regeneration, using synthetic biology to fight deadly drug-resistant bacteria, determining the principles of biological innovation and the creation of computational models to understand themulticellular basis of infectious disease.
