Another September, another Disrupt SF.And with any Disrupt comes the Disrupt Hackathon, where more than 700 hackers have gathered to build a product in under 24 hours. Theyre given food, beverage, and booze in the hopes that some combination of alcohol, caffeine and camaraderie will yield a stellar hack.We also equip the hackers with various APIs from our lovely sponsors, giving them all the tools they need to build something awesome.Tomorrow at 11am PT, the hackathon presentations will begin, where each hack has exactly 60 seconds on the Disrupt main stage to show their stuff to a panel of expert judges.And then, when its all over, Disrupt SF 2015 begins bright and early on Monday.Its only the beginning of a very long week, folks. Buckle up.
