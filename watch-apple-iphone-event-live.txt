You woke up, and it felt like a regular Wednesday. And then you realized that today is actually Apple iPhone day, where each year the internet crashes over what is, essentially, a new internet device.Like most everyone, you want to watch the event as it unfolds live. But how? When? Where?If youre a Mac/iPhone/iPad/Apple TV user, its very simple. Just hit up this dedicated Apple Event page using a Safari browser. Apple TV users can find an Apple Event app on their home screen this morning, which will also provide a live stream of the event.If you dont have access to an Apple product, then youre kind of SOL, with the exception of Windows 10 users.For the first time ever, Apple is letting Windows 10 users view the live stream via the Microsoft Edge browser, which is compatible with Apples HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) tech.Like every other Apple event since the dawn of mankind, the iPhone 6S/6S Plus event will begin promptly at 10am PT and last for a couple of hours.You can also check out our live blog of the event right here.Buckle up, folks.
