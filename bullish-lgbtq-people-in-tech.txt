Welcome back to another episode of Bullish! This time, I sat down with Lesbians Who Tech founder Leanne Pittsford to talk about LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) inclusivity in the workplace. Although some techcompanies have released data around people of color and female representation in their workforce, only one company, Slack, has actually released data around LGBTQ people.We actually dont have any of the data about how LGBT people in the workplace are really being impacted because its a little bit of an HR issue, Pittsford says. Its been something thats been private for people, but I think thats the next frontier, sort of getting the data and then assessing where people are.For workplaces that would like to become more inclusive, Pittsford suggests listening and asking questions. Another good thing might be to go to aLesbians Who Tech Summit, which is coming up later this week in San Francisco.Lesbians inattendance will be someone whos working on getting us to Mars by 2020, Pittsford says, and someone from Genentech working on a cure for cancer.I think why weve had so much growth is we focus on the technology first, Pittsford says. Theyre talking about all the amazing tech theyre working on and they just happen to be LGBTQ women LGBTQ women of color.
