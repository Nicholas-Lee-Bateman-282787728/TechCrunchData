Mobile security firm Lookout has introduced today what may be one of the more practical applications for Apple Watch. Its new smartwatch app will help you to not lose your phone, by alerting you if youre about to leave your phone behind, as well as help you locate a lost or stolen phone by pointing you to its last known location.The app can also be used to trigger a scream on your iPhone (a loud alert) thatcan help you find a misplaced phone. This could even be used in the case where you suspect your phone has just been lifted by an unknown third party, such as pickpocket.In addition, on the smartwatch apps homescreen, youll see a distance visualization bar, whichshows you how far away you are from your phone. As you walk around, the bar will adjust so you know if youre getting warmer or colder, the company explains. This feature requires a Bluetooth connection, so its ideal for finding the phone around the house or some other small area.However, you can make your iPhone scream over Wi-Fi, in case youre out of Bluetooth range but the phone is still somewhere relatively nearby.If youve left your phone somewhere much further away, the app displays a map showing the phones last known location. This location is nearly real-time, as the backend is constantly tracking the iPhones GPS. One caveat here: apps that utilize the GPS can have an effect on your iPhones battery. However,as the app has only just launched, its unclear at this time how pronounced that effect will be for Lookouts app.In what is perhaps the best feature of all, you can configure the app to buzz your Apple Watch when youre out of Bluetooth range. This helps to address the most common lost phone scenario  where youve inadvertently set your phone down then left it behind as you walked away.Lookout says the apps invention was born of the companys regular employee hackathons, and was then made a part of the broader product roadmap.To get the new Apple Watch app, youll need to download or update to the latest version of the Lookout app for iPhone, then sync your Apple Watch with your phone.
