The legal tussle between Apple and the FBI over a locked iPhone, and the security weakening measures the security services want the iOS makerto take to help it extract data on the device, has now attracted comment from the UNs commissioner for human rights.Representatives for both sides of the Apple vs FBI argumentwere called toCongressearlier this week to give testimony in a hearing entitled The Encryption Tightrope: Balancing Americans Security and Privacy  which has led to some bizarre claims from the pro-unlocking campas they seek to justify forcing Apple to create a less secure version of iOS.Weighing into the debate today on Apples side of the argument, with a robustpublicstatementin support of encryption,the UNs Zeid Raad Al Hussein arguesthat privacy isa pre-requisite for security, and calls for clear red lines to protectpersonal data in the digital age.The outcome of the Apple vs FBI case could have negative ramifications for the humans rights of people across the world if theFBIprevails in forcing Apple to weaken the security of iOS, he writes, warningthat such a step couldbe a gift to authoritarian regimes.In order to address a security-related issue related to encryption in one case, the authorities risk unlocking a Pandoras Box that could have extremely damaging implications for the human rights of many millions of people, including their physical and financial security, saysAl Hussein.I recognize this case is far from reaching a conclusion in the US courts, and urge all concerned to look not just at the merits of the case itself but also at its potential wider impact.The commissionerargues thecase boils down todeterminingwhere a key red line necessary to safeguard all of us from criminals and repression should be set  countering the notion itismerelyabout unlocking one iPhone used in a terrorist incident, as the US government has tried to suggest.There are many ways to investigate whether or not these killers had accomplices besides forcing Apple to create software to undermine the security features of their own phones, he writes of the San Bernardino terrorists, one of whom usedthe phone in question as a work device. This is not just about one case and one IT company in one country. It will have tremendous ramifications for the future of individuals security in a digital world which is increasingly inextricably meshed with the actual world we live in.A successful case against Apple in the US will set a precedent that may make it impossible for Apple or any other major international IT company to safeguard their clients privacy anywhere in the world. It is potentially a gift to authoritarian regimes, as well as to criminal hackers. There have already been a number of concerted efforts by authorities in other States to force IT and communications companies such as Google and Blackberry to expose their customers to mass surveillance.The commissioner goes on to flag upthe widespread global use ofencryption tools  such as by political dissidents, journalists and human rights defenders  arguing that encryption and anonymity are vitalenablers of both freedom of expression and opinion, and the right to privacy.It is neither fanciful nor an exaggeration to say that, without encryption tools, lives may be endangered. In the worst cases, a Governments ability to break into its citizens phones may lead to the persecution of individuals who are simply exercising their fundamental human rights, he continues, adding:There is, unfortunately, no shortage of security forces around the world who will take advantage of the ability to break into peoples phones if they can.And there is no shortage of criminals intent on committing economic crimes by accessing other peoples data. Personal contacts and calendars, financial information and health data, and many other rightfully private information need to be protected from criminals, hackers and unscrupulous governments who may use them against people for the wrong reasons. In an age when we store so much of our personal and professional lives on our smart phones and other devices, how is it going to be possible to protect that information without fail-safe encryption systems?Al Hussein concludes that the core of the issue is a question ofproportionality, arguing that the security services hope to gain extra information about one dreadful crime must be weighed against the risk of enabling a multitude of other crimes all across the world.The debate around encryption is too focused on one side of the security coin, in particular its potential use for criminal purposes in times of terrorism. The other side of the security coin, is that weakening encryption protections may bring even bigger dangers to national and international security, he adds.
