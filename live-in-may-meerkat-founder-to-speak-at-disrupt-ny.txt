Few apps have instantly captured the hearts, minds and eye-rolls of the tech scene like Meerkat. And to think Ben Rubin was building something else. The CEO of Life On Air was working on a private live-streaming app for groups of friends when Meerkats public streaming app suddenly took off. Without hesitation, he reassigned his10-person team to Meerkat, and now its little LIVE NOW links are taking over Twitter.In May, Rubin will join us for a chat at TechCrunch Disrupt NY, his first major onstage talk since his app took off.Well ask Rubin about how to blow up on Product Hunt, pivoting a rocket ship in mid-flight, and whether live-streaming is just a fad. Hell give fellow entrepreneurs insights about re-prioritizing projects and features in response to customer demand.And of course, well discuss the dark cloud on the horizon. Twitter has acquired, but not yet launched, a Meerkat competitor called Periscope. That doesnt bode well for Rubins product, which is built entirely on Twitter. What will Meerkat do? How will it compete with a native Twitter product?And luckily, since all of Disrupt is live-streamed on TechCrunch, Rubin wont have to hold his phone up the whole time.Rubin joins our speaker list thats packed withnotable founders and successful investors.
