Facebooks data harvesting practices arefacing yet another probe in Europe. This time the German federal competition authority (theBundeskartellamt) is initiating proceedings  rather than it being a European Member States national data protection watchdog.So rather than privacy regulations being the jumping off pointfor this latest probe ofFacebooks business practices, the company is being investigatedostensibly on antitrust grounds. Butits data harvesting practices are being linked with German competition law on account of Facebooksdominant market position in the country.News of the investigation was reported earlier by Fortune.The specific accusation is thatFacebook is using unlawful terms and conditions related toits collection and use of user data, and given the T&Cs are a condition for access to its service the suspicion is thatcould constitute an abuse of a dominant market position.It is difficult for users to understand and assess the scope of the agreement accepted by them. There is considerable doubt as to the admissibility of this procedure, in particular under applicable national data protection law. If there is a connection between such an infringement and market dominance, this could also constitute an abusive practice under competition law, writes theGerman competition authority.Dominant companies are subject to special obligations. These include the use of adequate terms of service as far as these are relevant to the market. For advertising-financed internet services such as Facebook, user data are hugely important. For this reason it is essential to also examine under the aspect of abuse of market power whether the consumers are sufficiently informed about the type and extent of data collected, addsAndreas Mundt, president of the Bundeskartellamt, in a statement on the action.The social network gianthas faced plenty of privacy-relatedinvestigations and orders fromEuropeanDPAsin recent times  including receiving a formal order from the French DPA last month to stop tracking non-users via cookies and social plug-ins; and back in summer 2015 court action from the Belgian DPA over a similar tracking issue. In the latter case Facebooklater agreed tochange how its site operates in the country.TheBundeskartellamts move is interesting as it seeks to link similar data-protection related privacy concerns with antitrust law  which carries higher potential fines for companies found to be abusing their market position, andinvolves better resourced departments carrying out investigations than the over-worked, under resourced DPAs.The German competition authoritys action is also targeting Facebook Inc., USA, the Irish subsidiary of the company and Facebook Germany GmbH, Hamburg. In fighting privacy related actions initiated by European DPAs Facebook has typically tried to use a jurisdiction-based argument to its advantage, claiming individual member states do not have jurisdiction over its regional business, and arguing instead that it is onlybound by the Irish DPA, as its European HQ is in Ireland. Using a competition law route to press privacy concerns against Facebook may be one way for European countries to workaround that argument.The Bundeskartellamts action also follows comments made by the European Commissions competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, at the start of this yearin which she suggesteddominanttech platforms thatharvestvast amounts of personaldata might in futurebe considered in breach of the overarching EUscompetition rules  based on theirdata holdings. So this is not the first time European competition authorities are linkingsystematic data-collection with antitrust concerns.If a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market, Vestager told the DLD conference back in January. Ifacompanys use ofdata is so bad for competition that it outweighs thebenefits,we may have to step in to restorea level playing field,adding that her department would continue tolook carefully at this issue.TheBundeskartellamtnotes it is conducting its Facebook antitrust probein close contact with the competent data protection officers, consumer protection associations as well as the European Commission and the competition authorities of the other EU Member States.At the time of writing Facebook had not responded to a request for comment.
