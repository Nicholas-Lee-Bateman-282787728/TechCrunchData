As algorithmic decision-making touchesmore and more aspects of our lives, questions about the underlying rules that route these bits and bytes  and ultimately determine thedigital content and opportunities we are exposed to aregrowing.A study by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and the International Computer Science Institute, reported this week in the MIT Technology Review, has highlighted potential gender bias in Googles ad-targeting algorithms. The researchers foundthat male job seekers weremore likely than equivalent female job seekers to be shown ads for high-paying executive jobs when they visited a news website.The researchersused a tool of their own making, calledAdFisher, to gain intel on how Googles ad-targeting works, recording the ads served byGoogle on third party websitesaftercreated scores of carefully curatedweb user profiles  giving thema benchmark to compare how ads were being served to users based on theirinterests andgender.Howeverthey cautionits difficult to definitively determine how ads are being targeted because the process is so complex and opaque. Ad buyers can make demographic decisions about the targeting themselves and also incorporate their own data sources on peoples online behavior to do additional targeting for certain types of ads. So where exactly any gender bias in ad serving is coming from is difficult to determine without more data.The researchers write:We cannot determine who caused these findings due to our limited visibility into the ad ecosystem, which includes Google, advertisers, websites, and users. Nevertheless, these results can form the starting point for deeper investigations by either the companies themselves or by regulatory bodies.Another finding was that Googles ad settingstransparency tool,which letsusersview and edit the interests the companyhas inferred for them (based on tracking their digital behavior), does not always reflect potentially sensitive information that is beingused to target themwith ads.Browsing sites aimed at people with substance abuse problems, for example, triggered a rash of ads for rehab programs, but there was no change to Googles transparency page, reportsthe MIT Technology Review. It goes on to quote Anupam Datta, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University who helped develop the AdFisher tool, criticizing the lack of transparency around ad targeting.I think our findings suggest that there are parts of the ad ecosystem where kinds of discrimination are beginning to emerge and there is a lack of transparency.This is concerning from a societal standpoint,saidDatta.Asked for its response to the research, Google provided the following statement to TechCrunch:Advertisers can choose to target the audience they want to reach,and we havepoliciesthat guide the type of interest-based ads that are allowed. We provide transparency to users with Why This Ad notices and Ad Settings, as well as the ability to opt out of interest-based ads.Googles policy for interest-based advertisingapparently includes restrictions on advertisers targeting based on a variety of sensitive categories, such as health and medical, sexual orientationandnegative financial status. However, based on the research findings,it appears that substance abuse data is being used to target Google users with ads for rehab clinics  which surely strays intothe health/medical category targeting exclusion. So its possible advertisers are relying ontheir own data for such sensitivetargeting.The researchers note that since being contacted by them about their research Google hasadded a disclaimerto its ad settings page to note that the information shown on the pagereflects only some of the Google ads that you see. Datta argues that limits theusefulness of thetransparency tool, adding that he believes Google couldreveal afuller picture aroundinterest-based ad-targeting ifit chose to.They are serving these ads, and if they wanted to they could reflect these interests,he said.Other issues that might be influencing ad targeting could include aspects such as the relative value of different demographicsandgenders to advertisers  and the resulting volume of ad inventory to serve each. The sites where ads are being served areanother influencing variable.
