TunnelBear, the company responsible for one of the better looking and easiest to use VPNs, is making its service even more accessibleafter it introduced an extension for Googles Chrome browser.TunnelBear for Chrome is available right now. It will be particularly of interest to fans of services like Netflix and Spotify who dont live insupported countries. TunnelBear has long been a popular option for Netflix junkies overseas because its free tier gives a generous 500MB allowance which can be upgraded to 1GB just by tweetingabout the service.Initially, non-payingusersof the extension will top out at 750MB, but TunnelBear told TechCrunch it will implement the 1GB offer soon.Existing customers can use the extension as part of their membership package. For those who owna Chromebook or Linux machine, the extension bringsTunnelBear to each platformfor the first time. TunnelBear also plans to launchextensions for Firefox, Safari and other browsers.Our goal is to make [using a VPN]as easy and accessible as possible, TunnelBear co-founder Ryan Dochuk told TechCrunch in an interview. The extension is so fast and so easy that you should be using it in your everyday internet activity.VPNs are also aboutproviding security for your online activities,the importance of which was underscored by Edward Snowdens NSA leaks, but thisextension is about convenience so there is a trade-off.It includes the same 14 global destinations to tunnel to, but the more detailed privacyoptions  which include TCP override and the option to fully hide your location  are absent.Thats because theChrome extension isnt actually a VPN at all, rather it is an encrypted proxy. It isntas secure as the main TunnelBear app  the Chrome extension uses AES 128-bit encryption, the main apps use a stronger AES-256 combination so it isnt the answer for keeping your entire machines data wholly secure, but it doessimplify the processes.Forpeople who didnt feel ready to use a full VPN, we think that this is the easiest option,Dochuk said.TunnelBear, which was founded in 2011 and is based in Toronto, said its service is used by more than five million people across 179 countries. The company doesnt break out its paying customer numbers, however.I createda free account for the extension and burned through my 750MBs pretty quickly. The strategy with the extension, like the free tier, is to get users toup-sell to a paid membership at that point.
