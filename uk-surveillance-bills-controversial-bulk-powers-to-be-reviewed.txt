The UK government has agreed to an independent review of so called bulk collection  aka mass surveillance  powers in proposed new surveillance legislation, one of the most controversial elements of the Investigatory Powers bill which iscurrently before parliament. Its aiming to get the billonto the statute books before the end of this year.Bulk powers set out in the IP bill include a provision for bulk equipment interference  aka mass hacking  allowing the security and intelligence agencies to compromise multiple devices/services as part of their investigations.A further provision relating to state hacking capabilities set out in a Code of Practiceassociated with the draft bill notes thatcommunications service providers may be required to maintain a technical capability to enable their users data to be intercepted  including having user data harvestedin bulk  a scenariothat humanrights group Privacy International described to TechCrunch asthe worst formof backdoor.The bulk powers reviewwas one of the concessions called for by the opposition Labour Partys Shadow Home Secretary, Andy Burnham,in Aprilwhen the party abstained on a vote on the legislation. Burnham said substantial changes were needed before the party would consider supporting the bill.Speaking about the latest developments inparliament yesterday, Burnhamdescribed Home Secretary Theresa May agreeing to an independent review of the case for bulk powers as a major concession and something which will build trust in this process.He also said Mays letter clarified that state agencies cannot use surveillance powers tomonitor legitimate trade union activity  another keyconcern forLabour.Independent terrorism reviewer returnsThe planned bulk powers review, due to report this summer, will be ledby QC David Anderson  whopreviously played a key role forthe government as it was drafting the IP bill, as its independent terrorism legislationreviewer.In his letter to the Home Secretary back in April, Labours Burnham describedit as imperative an independent review of bulk powers be set up, writing: I would be open to a discussion about the various forms this independent review could take but it is imperative that we get it up and running. I will consider carefully the nature and extent of the bulk powers in this Bill in light of the review.Yesterday in parliament he said he was pleased the government had agreed to a review and approached Anderson to lead it.We, on this side of the House, strongly welcome that development and we believe in the end it will build trust and support behind her Bill, he added.There are other areas in which we wish to see significant movement and we will continue to work in a constructive spirit to achieve it. But this letter shows that the Home Secretary is listening and that bodes well for the rest of this Bills passage.A flagshiprecommendation from Andersons earlier reporton this area of legislation was that government ministers should hand intercept warrant sign offs to the judiciary  a suggested change only partially reflected in the bill before parliament now, which has a so called double lock sign off mechanism, involving both judiciary and senior ministers (although it also allows for the Home Secretary to solely authorizeso called emergency warrants which are then retrospectively reviewed by a judge).Anderson also consideredbulk powers inhis prior report which wasgenerally supportive of security agencies being able to use the controversialcapability  leading to criticism of the reviewby civil rights groups.Liberty for example, which is challenging the legality of bulk collection/mass interception in the European Court of Human Rights, criticized theearlier report for offering only six Agency case studies as justification for bulk collection  arguing that thisvague and limited information was not substantial enough toassess security outcomes had other more targeted surveillance methods been used.That said, Andersons priorsupport for bulk powers was predicated upon there also being strict additional safeguards in the associated legislation  including: judicial authorization; tighter operational/mission definitions of the purposes for which bulk datais being sought; and bulk warrants beingtypically targeted at thecommunications ofpeoplebelieved to be outside the UK at the time ofthe sought forcommunications.So it remains to be see whether Andersonwill judge the IP bill includes enough of these safeguards to justify continued state used of mass interception powers. Since his prior report, multipleparliamentary committees have scrutinized the draft bill and been critical of its overly broad powers,alack of clarity and not enough privacy safeguards.It is also not clear whether the bulk powers review will include the IP billsweb logging proposals  aka the Internet Connection Records (ISCs) that ISPs will be required to record and retain for 12 months, creating records of all the websites and services accessed by their users for the past year.A Home Office spokesman declined to specify whether ISCs will be included in Andersons forthcomingreview.Logging the digital activity of every UK citizen just in case sounds very much like abulk capability that sorely needs reviewing for proportionality so lets hope so.Update:Burnhams spokesman has now confirmed the review will not include ISCs but only focus on capabilities badged as bulk in the bill. So thats a missed opportunity then.In astatement a spokesman for the Home Office added:The Home Secretary has always been clear she will listen to the constructive views of politicians from all sides of the House to ensure the passage of this important Bill. The Government will be bringing forward amendments at Report Stage.At the European level, EU mass surveillance legislationwasoverturned by the European Court of Justice, back in April 2014, which judged such bulk intercept powers ascontravening fundamental privacy and human rights.This post was updated with additional comment
