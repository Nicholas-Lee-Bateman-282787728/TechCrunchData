Pinterest is makingits visual social network a destination for app downloads, after it announceda partnership with Apple that lets its users download iOS apps directly from its mobileapp.The company said that app Pins will be visible within its iOS app  bad news for Android-loving Pinners, this is an iOS exclusive  and will allow users to pin their favorite apps, and alsodownload apps for aniPad or iPhone without leaving the Pinterest app.Thats significant not only because the App Store is brimming with apps, more than 1.4 million to be precise, which make finding new downloads tough, but because Pinterest is inherently mobile. The companytold The New York Timesthat75 percent of activity on its service  which has an estimated 70 million monthly users  comes from mobile devices.Apple took the lead and opened an App Store account on Pinterest to help showcase apps.Pinterest made its name with photos, but this tie-in with Apple is another example of itexpanding its focus into other media, with the goal of monetization in mind. Itbranched out to cater to the travel and cooking verticals with dedicated new features, but perhaps the most significant new arrival was promoted (aka advertiser) pins which opened to allin December of last year following a beta period.The U.S. company has raised significant capital from investors  it closed a $200 million Series F round at a $5 billion valuation in May2014  butonly recently has moved towards monetizing its service. Promoted pins are an obvious source of revenue, andapp Pins  though initially for users  could also yield revenue for the companyif it decides to openthem up to developer and advertiser promotion.Theres a case for that move already.Facebookapp installs have blossomed into a lucrative business for the worlds most popular social network, while Twitter letsdevelopers promote app download links onits service. Pinterest doesnt enjoy the same scale as either of those companies, butthis new opportunity to gain downloads among its loyal user base could becomeaninteresting acquisition channel for developers.
