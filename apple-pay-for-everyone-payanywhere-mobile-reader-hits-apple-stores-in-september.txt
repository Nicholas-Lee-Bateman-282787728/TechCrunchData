It doesnt happen that often, but once in a while I find myself in the wild without my wallet and reallyneed to buy something. Because I absolutely never leave the house without my iPhone, Ive gotten used to finding the nearest Walgreens, or Whole Foods, or Petco or some other retailer thataccepts Apple Pay  in order to buy what I need. And most of the timeI can get by.But what about independentmerchants, the kind that arent big enough to partner with Apple? Maybe its myfavorite cheese vendor at the farmers market, or a repair technician, or theneighborhood coffee shop. Maybe I just want to go jogging wearing my Apple Watch and stop at a street fairand buy a big-ass painting of the Golden Gate Bridge. Im obviously not going to have my purse with me, right? Thekind, elderly watercolor painter has noway to take my money via Apple Pay, right?Thats allabout to change.
