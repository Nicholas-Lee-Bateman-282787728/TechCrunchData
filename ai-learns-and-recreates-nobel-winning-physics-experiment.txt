Australian physicists, perhaps searching for a way to shorten the work week, have created an AI that can run and even improve a complex physics experiment with little oversight. The research could eventually allow human scientists to focus on high-level problems and research design, leaving the nuts and bolts to a robotic lab assistant.The experiment the AI performed was the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate, a hyper-cold gas, the process for which won three physicists the Nobel Prize in 2001. It involves using directed radiation to slow a group of atoms nearly to a standstill, producing all manner of interesting effects.It did things a person wouldnt guess, such as changing one lasers power up and down, and compensating with another, said ANUs Paul Wigley, co-lead researcher, in a news release. I didnt expect the machine could learn to do the experiment itself, from scratch, in under an hour. It may be able to come up with complicated ways humans havent thought of to get experiments colder and make measurements more precise.Co-lead researchers Paul Wigley (left) and Michael Hush.Bose-Einstein condensates have strange and wonderful properties, and their extreme sensitivity to fluctuations in energy make them useful for other experiments and measurements. But that same sensitivity makes the process of creating and maintaining them difficult. The AI monitors many parameters at once and can adjust the process quickly and in ways that humans might not understand, but which are nevertheless effective.The result: condensates can be created faster, under more conditions, and in greater quantities. Not to mention the AI doesnt eat, sleep, or take vacations.Its cheaper than taking a physicist everywhere with you, said the other co-lead researcher, Michael Hush, of the University of New South Wales. You could make a working device to measure gravity that you could take in the back of a car, and the artificial intelligence would recalibrate and fix itself no matter what.This AI is extremely specific in its design, of course, and cant be applied as-is to other problems; for more flexible automation, physicists will still have to rely on the general-purpose research units called graduate students.The teams research appeared today in the journal Scientific Reports.
