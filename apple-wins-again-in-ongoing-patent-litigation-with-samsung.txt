A federal appeals court on Thursday ruledSamsung should have been barred from retailingproducts that infringe on Apples patents.Apple had been denied an injunction against Samsung by a lower court in May 2014. A jury ordered Samsung to pay Apple $120 million for violating patents for the iPhones slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and data detection features.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., reversed that decision in a 2-1 ruling, stating that Apples injunction does not want to ban the devices from the marketplace and the patented features can be removed without a product recall.The blow to Samsung is largely symbolic. The company says it will appeal the decision.We will pursue our rights to have the full Court of Appeals review todays decision, Samsung said in a statement.We want to reassure our millions of loyal customers that all of our flagship smartphones, which are wanted and loved by American consumers, will remain for sale and available for customer service support in the U.S.Apple said the ruling reiterates that Samsung copied its patents, and it referred to a previous statement.We are fighting to defend the hard work that goes into beloved products like the iPhone, which our employees devote their lives to designing and delivering for our customers, the company said.
