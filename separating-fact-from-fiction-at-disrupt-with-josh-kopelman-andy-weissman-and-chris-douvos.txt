When a market turns, everyone get socked to a certain degree.Atour upcoming TechCrunch Disrupt conference, well be sitting down with three pros on the front lines of a suddenly slowingtech economy to find outhow theyre dealing withsuch circumstances and, in some cases, taking advantage ofthem.In the one corner, expect to hear from Chris Douvos, a limited partner with Venture Investment Associateswhowants to see more moolah in the coolah, as does every institutional investor who commits money to venture firms.Though Douvos is a proud stakeholder in such firms as True Ventures, Data Collective, and First Round Capital, he says LPs are getting hit up for fresh funding from VCs at the very worst time. We have a down-trending public market at the same time that [our] private investments are really inflated [and not exiting], so LPs are getting doubly crushed.In the other corneror,more aptly, seated beside Douvos bothFirst Round Capital founder Josh Kopelman and Union Square Ventures partner Andy Weissman will be joining us to talk where the fast-shifting marketplace leaves them. (Hint: Its between pleasing LPs like Douvos and helping startups that need more money and may have a harder time securing it right now. We believe this is known asa rock and a hard place.)Do you have questions aboutvaluations, new funds, raising money, and making money last longer? Wantto hear about theoften close but sometimes precarious relationships between LPs, VCs, and venture-backed startups?We do, too. Join us for whats sureto be a rollicking discussion that covers it all,at Disrupt in New York, May 9 through May 11.
