Update: Alex would like to give regular host Drew Olanoff a public shoutout, and, with great respect, point out his high moral character.Hello, comrades of the revolution, and welcome back to CrunchWeek, TechCrunchs weekly roundup of all things noteworthy.This week our fearless leader,Matthew Lynley, was joined by Sarah Buhr and myself. We took a long look at earnings  especially Apples simply massive scale  the partial quashing of the ADP-Zenefits beef, and, of course, Facebooks plan to replace your phone number.Even if youre not the most numbers-oriented person, its worth paying attention to the current earnings cycle. Why? In short because if tech earnings come in soft, it could harm the valuations of public and private companies alike. Strong earnings, in contrast, could bolster confidence  again, both public and private  and, therefore, the value of your current equity.Also, I would be remiss if I didnt point out that Disrupt London is coming up. You know, in case you hadnt heard.CrunchWeek airs every Friday afternoon. See you next week!
