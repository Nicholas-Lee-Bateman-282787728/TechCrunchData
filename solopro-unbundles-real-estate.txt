SoloPro, a service that unbundles real estate services and gives buyers a 3 percent rebatewhen they buy a home through the service, today announced that it has received a strategic investment from home improvement giant Lowes venture arm. Neither Lowes Companies Venture Capital norSoloPro disclosed the value of the investment, but its likely a relatively modestnumber given SoloPros oversubscribed$1.1 million round in June.The company, which is based in Raleigh-Durham, is currently testing its service in select markets.Unlike a traditional real estate firm, SoloPro aims to make the real estate market more efficient by unbundling services.Maybe you only need an agent to see a house thats listed for sale, but youre already doing all the work of finding the house yourself anyway. With SoloPro, you can get an agent to do that for you and you only pay the agent afixed price. Most agents on the service charge between $0 and $30 for this right now. Other services real estate agents can offer include phone consultations, pricing a home, or attending a walk-through, inspection and closing.To submit an offer, you then work with a SoloPro partner agent, and once the process is done, the company will refund you the 3 percent commission a traditionalagent would usually get. Thats not unlike what Redfin already does(except for in the otherwise beautiful state of Oregon, where a state law explicitly forbids brokers from doing this), though Redfins model is more akin to a modernized version of the buyer/agent relationship than a complete unbundling of it.SoloPros $1.1 million round was led by Oxpoint Investments and Buchanan Ventures, with participation from Blue {Seed} Capital, Arnold Capital and a number of angel investors. Getting Lowes on board now is a major coup for the company.This investment by Lowes is a huge win for SoloPro and for our homebuyers, said Tommy Sowers, CEO and founder of SoloPro, in a statement today. This strategic investment by Lowes gives us a longer runway. Lowes investment also signals strong interest from the leader of DIY home improvement with connecting with DIY home buyers.While Lowes big-box stores may be ubiquitous, the companys venture arm is still relatively unknown. Over the last year or so, however, Lowes has made a number ofhigh-profile investments in housing- and real estate-related companies like PorchandDecorist.
