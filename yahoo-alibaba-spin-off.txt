In addition to releasing its (mixed) fourth-quarter earnings report, Yahoo just announced its plan to spin off its stake in Alibaba into a new company, currently dubbed SpinCo.The new company will own all of Yahoos 384 million remaining shares in Alibaba, valued at $40 billion. The spin off will be tax-free, which had been predicted and was one of the main concerns of shareholders  and as of 4:32 p.m. Eastern, Yahoo shares were up more than 7 percent in after-hours trading.Throughout my tenure with the company, we have worked tirelessly on a tax-efficient alternative that would maximize the value of our Alibaba investment for our shareholders, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said in the spin-off release. A tax-free spin-off accomplishes this and delivers value directly and exclusively to our shareholders.In an earnings call last year, Mayer (whos been facing increasing pressure from activist investors on this and a number of other issues) said the company was working with the best tax experts in the country working on structures to maximize the the value [of the Alibaba stake] to our shareholders.Yahoo says the spin-off should be completed in the fourth quarter of this year (after the post-Alibaba IPO lock up on Yahoo shares expires). SpinCo will be a publicly traded company, with stock distributed pro rata to Yahoo shareholders, and will also include a legacy, ancillary Yahoo business.Yahoo bought its stake in Alibaba back in 2005, with Alibaba running a number of Yahoo-branded properties in China.The strategy wound down in recent years, withwith Yahoo China shutting down in September 2013.
