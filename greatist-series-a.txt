Greatist, a website promising real facts and doable steps for your happiest life, has raised $4.5 million in Series A funding.I wrote about the startup in 2012, when I said it was focused on non-sucky health content. In other words, it offeredhealth and wellness advice targeted at millennial readers, presented with a distinctiveeditorial voice and based on real reporting/research.Since then, founder and CEODerek Flanzraich saidthe company has grown to 10 million unique monthly visitors, with 50 percent of that traffic coming from organic search and less than 25 percent from social networks. Greatists revenue also grew last year, from just about zero to profitability.Flanzraich said theteam has purposefully stayed capital efficient and bootstrappy because he knew it would take a while to build a brand-first business.The funding was led byFloodgate, with participation from Strauss Zelnick, Andy Russell, John Gardner and David Pecker. Greatist has now raised a total of $8 million, with past investors includingRiverPark Ventures, Vayner/RSE, Jon Miller, Ramit Sethi and Chris Hughes also participating in the Series A.
