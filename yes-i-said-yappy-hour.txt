Ive already posted one interview from last weekends Yappy Hour event at South by Southwest  my interview with Courtney Dasher, owner of Instagram star Tuna Melts My Heart.But I wasnt just there to talk about dogs that are big on social media. I also spoke to Aaron Hirschhorn, co-founder and CEO of dog-sitting marketplace DogVacay, and Ben Jacobs, co-founder and CEO of Whistle, which makes an activity tracker for pets.Hirschhorn and Jacobs both talked about their respective companies, about working togetheron the days pet adoption event promoting the no-kill animal shelter Austin Pets Alive, and about the emergence of a broader category of pet startups. Asked if things are always so friendly between the differentpet startups, Jacobs told me:Right now, theres a few great companies emerging  folks like DogVacay, like BarkBox out in New York, like Whistle, here in San Francisco. Our focus is to really bring new products and services to the pet owner market. Theres alredy over 80 million dogs in the US  theres more dogs than kids  and $60 billion spent on those animals. So I think right now, were really locking arms and helping to create the new category of companies.
