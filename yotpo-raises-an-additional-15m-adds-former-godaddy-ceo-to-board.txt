Yotpo, a platform thathelps businesses with original content marketing, just announced the closing of a $15 million funding round. This brings total funding so far by the company to $30 million.Founded in Tel Aviv, Yotpo now helps more than 100,000 business with marketing, of which 65 percent are located in the United States. The company said it will use this funding to further expand its New York City office, as well as double its employee headcount (currently at 75) within the next 12 months.Once a business signs up with Yotpo, the company uses data to identify the optimal methods to persuade a user to generate original content. For example, this means Yotpo has learned exactly when and how to engage specific customers post-purchase for the best chance at getting them to write a review.Tomer Tagrin, co-founder and CEO of Yotpo, explained that different customers have vastly different behaviors in terms of how they create content.Tagrin explained that users in Germany dont like to review products on the weekend, meaning email targeting needs to occur during the week. Another example was thatusers who purchase electronics take an average of four times longer to write a product review, compared to a user purchasing a fashion product.The company said that analytics like these allow it to supply customers withup to 10 times more user-generated content than itscompetitors. Yotpos platform has led to an additional $50 million in revenue for its customers over the last year.Yotpo also announced that Warren Adelman, former CEO of GoDaddy, will be joining its board.
