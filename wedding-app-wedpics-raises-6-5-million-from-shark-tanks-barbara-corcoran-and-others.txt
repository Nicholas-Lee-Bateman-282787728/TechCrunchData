Shark TanksBarbara Corcoran and other investors have backed a popular mobile photo-sharing application called WedPics, designed for use by wedding couples and their guests. The additional funding brings the Raleigh, N.C.-area startups total Series B round to $6.5 million, a combination of equity and debt.This is actually the second close on the Series B (the earlier part which we reported back in December), as the round ended up being oversubscribed. The new part includes an additional $2.25 million on top of funds raised previously. Corcoran and her business partner Phil Nadel, aco-founder at Barbara Corcoran Venture Partners, both ended up investing personally in WedPics, as well as via their AngelList syndicate. That syndicate included Brad Feld, as well as investors hailing from Twitter and Apple.Others participatingin the Series B includeMiddleland Capital, WTI (bothequity and debt) and severalBay Area angels.In December, Miller said that WedPicswas acquiring 25,000 to 30,000 new brides to its photo and video-sharing service per month, and acquiring weddings at a cost of under $2 per wedding. The company was hosting over 6,000 weddings each weekend during the busy summer wedding season, with 175,000 guests joining.At the time, 2.5 million total users had downloaded WedPics in order to snap and share photos of the wedding and the wedding-related associated events, like rehearsal dinners and receptions. Another 35 percent of its user base areweb-only users.Since then, the momentum has continued, and Miller says that WedPics just sawover 40,000 new brides join WedPics in the month of January alone. Thats 198 percent year-over-year growth, he points out, adding that the company sees at least 1,000 brides per day signing up for the service.The companys current goal is to reach 800,000 new couples by the end of 2015, up from 300,000 last year. Some of those customers weddings will likely spill over onto the following year, but WedPics hopes to host around half a million or more weddings this year alone.To get to this point, WedPics is considering making some acquisitions in the wedding space, and is looking at a variety of companies now, includingcompetitors or even printing businesses. The latter would help itcapture additional revenue by offering WedPics customers wedding-related printed goods, such asinvitations and thank you cards among other things.The company, which grew in part thanks to its Facebook presence, is also now advertising on Pinterest, which has helped bring user acquisition costs down, and isgetting ready toexperiment with ads on Tumblr, too.Miller also attributes much of WedPics success to a sort of scrappiness that comes from companies based outside the Valley. From an ad perspective, we do a good job at attracting new users. And once we have new users, we do a good job at creating a viral appeal to their guest list, he says.The app, which also points guests to accommodations, registries and events, works as asort ofone-stop-shop for connecting with a couples wedding from your mobile phone. Users so far have responded well to the apps simplicity and ease-of-use, which has allowed WedPics to nail down the private, social experience that is weddings-related photo sharing.Now the company wants to know just how well its doing. It hired itsfirst data scientist to analyze what makes a successful wedding. Those with a certain number of photos or guests obviously make the grade, but the best is when one wedding leads to another, thanks to guests who remember to use the app again when it comes time for their big day.
