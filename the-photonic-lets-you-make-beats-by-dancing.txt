I never turn down a chance to dance in our videos. While walking through startups at Eureka Park at CES with Darrell Etherington doing live interviews with founders, I forced him to chat with Phonotonic, a startup that makes nifty orbs that translate your dance moves into beats, while I demoed the device beside them.Despitemy awkwardness in the video, the gadget is really fun to use. Basically, sensors inside each orbsend movement data to an app on your phonethat generates different music based onhow you swing your arms.You canuse the app with just one orb, butwith two you can generate the melody with one and the rhythm with the other. At one point in thedemo I handed off one of the orbs to someone else and dancedwith just one, and it was a bit weird to giveup a bit ofcontrol to the other dancer. Its just a total blast to have music that feels right for how youre dancing because its based onyour actual movements. While I was into the funky style of musicI danced to,the appcan generate music in a pretty wide variety of other genres. You also dont need the whole orb to use the app, as the sensors are stored in a tiny pod inside the larger orb and can be worn on clothing or placed on other instruments.We last covered Phonotonic when they were running their Kickstarter campaign last summer. Theyve sold out of their first batch, but you can pre-order units from the next round onPhonotonics sitefor 80.00 each with delivery set for February.
