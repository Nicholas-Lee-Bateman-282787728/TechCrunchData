Good news for amateur and professional photograph enthusiasts. Google has just made its Nik Collection photo editingsoftwareavailable completely free of charge.That collection includes sevendifferent desktop services that fell into Googles lapafter it acquired Nik Software back in 2012. That deal was largely about getting control of popular photo app Snapseed, a pretty powerful tool in itself, but Google later pulled the remaining Nik Software services together in an attractive $149 bundle. Thats now become free, and anyone who forked out to buy it this calendar can claim a refund.What services are we talking about here.Its certainly beyond the basics offered byapps like Instagram, as Google itself explained:The Nik Collection is comprised of seven desktop plug-ins that provide a powerful range of photo editing capabilities  from filter applications that improve color correction, to retouching and creative effects, to image sharpening that brings out all the hidden details, to the ability to make adjustments to the color and tonality of images.Free software is always welcome since it can help democratize photography tools, but the news has some fansworried that it may bea sign that these services will be discontinued soon.Google, of course, just killed offPicasa, which was once the center of its online photography ambition.Its a little too early to call the end of Nik Software, particularly whenGoogle saidthat this price removal is oneof its long-term investments in building incredible photo editing tools. Beyond Snapseed, which was made free and launched on Android after the Nik Software acquisition, itsportfolio also includes Google Photos, its cloud storage service for mobile that just got a smart new featureto create albums automatically.Hat tip PetaPixel
