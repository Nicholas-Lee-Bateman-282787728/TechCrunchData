Well, okay, I didnt actually try to interview a dog, because that would be silly. But while attending a pet adoption event at South by Southwest, I did talk to Courtney Dasher, owner of Instagram star Tuna Melts My Heart.What I wanted to know was: Whats like to own a social media celebrity? (Seriously, Tunas got 1.2 million followers.) Dasher works as an interior designer, but she admitted that supervising Tunas career has become pretty full-time at the moment. Nonetheless, shes happy that hes getting all the attention, rather than her.As for whether she plans to stop posting anytime soon, Dasher said:I guess Im just doing it for now, and well see what happens. I dont have any intention to stop, but it could be also the temperature of Instagram, what Instagrams going to look like in a few years. He just brings a lot of people joy and laughter, so thats why I continue to post, and Ill keep doing it, and keep doing a lot of other things, until nobody wants to see him anymore.
