LinkedIn the social platform used by 400 millionprofessionals looking to network or find work has taken a major tumble in the markets in the last few months over weak financial guidanceamid slowing growth. Sothis week, ahead of its next quarterly earnings on April 28, LinkedIn isshoringup in areas where its either alreadystrong or banking on growing more.Today, LinkedInlaunched a vastly overhauled new version of its Recruiter platform, the interface and paid product used by those who mine the companys database to fill jobs, which makes up a large part of Talent Solutions,LinkedInsbiggest revenue stream. (The main product is sold on a license basis, withthe averageprice starting at around $8,000 per user annually, the company tells me.)Thenew version  first previewed in October last year  includes a new interface and other enhancements, but perhaps most notable is the fact that it will now feature smart search and suggestions ofsimilar candidates. As part of LinkedInsartillery of services to woo more paying users (even as prices for those services continue to rise), Recruiter is now being offered as a free upgrade to about 80% of the 41,000 people who already subscribe toRecruiter globally (with the rest to come soon).LinkedIn appears tohave slowed down on its acquisition rush to build out its wider capabilities  its been a year now since the acquisition of Lynda for $1.5 billion  but its still trying to show investors that growth and diversification are coming. Just yesterday, the company launched its newest mobile app, LinkedIn Students, to capturemore younger, university-aged users with a Tinder-like swiped interface that offers a low-pressure LinkedIn experience: some career and leadership essays, a few suggested jobs and tips on improving your profile are the highlights.This is the companys latest attempt to court younger users, which make up only around22 percent of LinkedIns total user base, according to Pew. The Students app arrived at the same time that LinkedIn sunsetted most of its Student portal, which was initially launched in 2013 and included lowering the minimum age for using the network to 14, along with college-finding tools and job tips, but clearly wasnt getting enough interest or traction to keep updating it.But the new Recruiter platform is about bring new users and continuing to attract existing ones to a platform that has not been updated to any significant extent since 2013  a very long time, considering the many startups that have sprouted up hoping to muscle in on LinkedIns stronghold on this market, banked on its own database of hundreds of millions of professionals.To link up with the companys wider push to infuse the platformwith more intelligence and predictive actions, the company is adding in a new search feature to suggest different job categories, locations, and skills, to better link up what you are looking for with what is in LinkedIns database:The other interesting area, resonant of a once-competing service called Connectifier that LinkedIn has now acquired, is that LinkedIn now gives you the option of looking for candidates acrossa wider pool by letting you find potential people who share similar profile characteristics with people who you have already rated and decided are good (possibly even existing employees).(And in case you were wondering, LinkedIn tells me that for now its continuing to keep the Connectifier business as a standalone service and is not merging its functionality with that of Recruiter. I dont expect that to be the case for the long term, though: LinkedIn acquired Connectifier earlier this year, while it started to rebuild Recruiter last year, and possibly even earlier, so may have been a case of being too late to try to turn the ship, so to speak.)In addition to these two areas, some of the other areas that LinkedIn is also updating include new smart suggestions, which give those who are not Boolean search nerds the ability to choose pre-selected filters, made up of the most common terms, to speed up how you find things, which come up in a column on the left as buttons you can add or remove. After this you can also reorder your prospective hires base on how much they appeal.
