The company behind a device that helps parents enforce theirhomes internet rules and restrictions, Circle with Disney, launched last winter in partnership with Disney for its included media content, will now allow parents to manage childrens devices outside the home. The company announced this morning the launch of a subscription-based companion service called Circle Go that letsparents filter the web andapps, limit screen time, and keep up-to-date on how kids are spending time online even when theyre outside the bounds of the homes Wi-Fi network.The Circle with Disney hardware and software suite is one of a handful ofnew startups aimed at making parents lives easier when it comes to restricting internet use for children.Most devices  including iPhones, iPads, Android smartphones and tablets, and Amazons Fire tablets  come with parental controls built-in. But some parents struggle to understand these settings,while others feelthey can be more trouble than theyre worth. (Setting agerestrictions on apps can end up blocking YouTube, for example).Meanwhile, traditional parental control software can come across more like spyware rather than policy management tools.Startups are trying to rethink how parental controls should work in this multi-device, app-centric age. Along with Circle with Disney, the Amazon-backed Luma router also offers smart parental controls, while the newly launched Bark software, balances online safety and respect for childrens right to privacy, for example.Circle with Disneys currentproduct is a small hardware device that connects with your Wi-Fi network (but doesnt replace your current router), and is managed by an accompanying mobile app. Moms and dads can configure various controls to filter web searches, websites and app content, set bedtimes, block ads, view internet usage and other insights, and even pause the homes internet for a period of time.It will include Disney content such as trailers, video clips, games, social media posts, promos, and more from Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Star Wars, and elsewhere.While this system isuseful for managing yourhouseholdsrules regarding internet use, it was restricted to devices on the homes Wi-Fi network.Circle Go changes that, by allowing all of the original features to extend outside the home. This is not a standalone subscription service, however, but an add-on to Circle with Disney  it requires that you already have the $99 device and theMyCircle companion app installed.The service costs $9.95 per month and covers up to 10 devices.Like Circle with Disney, Circle Go lets you filter websites and apps, including managing platforms like Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube. And parents can set time limits, bedtimes, track web usage, and even pause 4G LTE and Wi-Fi on the childs device  a perfect tool for enforcing the age-old punishment:youre grounded: no phones or tablets for the rest of the day!The new subscription service is available viameetcircle.com, while the device itself can be purchased online at the companys website as well as from DisneyStore.com, Amazon, and both online or in-store at Target and Best Buy.
