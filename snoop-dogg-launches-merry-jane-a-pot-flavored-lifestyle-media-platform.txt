Snoop Dogg, world-renowned entertainment icon and unofficial representative of all things weed, has been investing in tech products and platforms for the past year or so, with a particular focus on the cannabis industry. But today, Snoop is entering the tech sphere in a whole new way, with the launch of his very own platform called Merry Jane.At its core, Merry Jane is a lifestyle media site with cannabis at the center. Loaded with both video content and editorial content, the site will serve as an information hub for everyone interested in pot, whether it be the n00b or the seasoned smoker.While announcing Merry Jane on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, Snoop said that the site will provide users with all they need to know about pot, and be the encyclopediaof the cannabis world.The site will have its own show series, each of which focusing on different aspects of pot as it relates to lifestyle.This ranges from a cooking show, where folks can learn how to make amazing edibles (or food that pairs well with cannabis consumption), to Deflowered (which is a show that focuses on peoples first time doing something), all the way to exclusive celebrity interviews. Snoop noted that the site will be enlisting celebrities that are down with the team including Seth Rogen and Miley Cyrus.But beyond that, Merry Jane will also take a hard editorial look at the business and politics of the cannabis industry, breaking news about legalization, policy, and industry growth.And thats just the start of it.Merry Jane also connects to its own database around various strains of cannabis, created by a Merry Jane editorial team, letting users learn more about the strain that might be right for them, and then connecting that reader/user with a local dispensary where they can procure said herbal supplement.But unlike other platforms that help inform the reader about different types of greenery, Merry Jane makes it super easy to search for what youre looking for, whether its a wax, edible, or flower. Users can search by type of cannabis, flavors, symptoms, and more, with high-res rotating imagery for every product listed.Pre-launch, Snoop and Chung curated dispensaries to put on the platform, but eventually dispensaries will be able to log in to the back end and upload their own menus, update them, and maintain control over their own digital storefront via Merry Jane.When asked about the business plan for the site, MJ cofounder Ted Chung said that advertising is definitely part of the plan, but noted that the most important thing is providing the marijuana business with adefinitive destination for brands and retail locations to create a strong presence.In terms of user acquisition, Chung said that the demand is already there, and expects the site to surpass its competitors within 6 months.Snoop also saidthat Merry Jane will be the door to bring people out of the closet. There are so many people in the closet, and we are giving them an opportunity to come out of the closet and just admit they like to smoke.Im a smoker, my name is Snoop Dogg, and Im a stoner.Merry Jane is launching at todays Disrupt SF 2015 conference,with a limited amount of beta testers receiving invites today. Over the next few weeks, the platform will open up to the general public.
