Versal is a service that allows teachers to build and publish interactive online courses, homework assignments and tutorials. The company launcheditsservice out of beta today, but maybe more importantly, it also announced a partnership with Wolfram Research.Thanks to this deal with Wolfram Research  which includes Stephen Wolfram joining the Versal board of directors  Versal now allows teachers to embed content from Wolfram into their courses. Currently, this means teachers can use the Wolfram Language to create content. The company tells me that a deeper integration is planned for the future, which will include support for Wolfram Demonstrations, Wolfram|Alpha widgets and other Wolfram resources (if you hadnt noticed, Stephen Wolfram likes to nameproducts after himself).With Versal and our new cloud-based capabilities theres an amazing opportunity to bring a new level of interactivity andcomputational knowledge to a very wide range of educational settings, Wolfram saysin a canned statement today. Were excited topartner with Versal to make this happen.Versal, in many ways, is a reaction to the video-centric learning platforms. Instead, teachers can use the services drag-and-drop tool to create new lessons with interactive timelines, quizzes, writing prompts, maps, and diagrams, for example. Whats even more interesting, though, is that developers can write their own widgets, too (in JavaScript).Thanks to this, the service featuresa music notation widgetwith a working keyboard, for example. Teachers can write equations with LaTeX, or annotate a 3D skeleton for anatomy lessons.With todays release, Versal is bringing the total number of widgets to 48, but the service  surprise, surprise  also offers an online classthat teaches you how to build your own gadget.Teachers who need advanced features like progress tracking, private courses and the ability to invite students have to subscribe to the companys $5/month Versal Pro plan.
