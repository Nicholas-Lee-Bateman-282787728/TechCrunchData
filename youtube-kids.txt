YouTube will launch a new, child-friendly version of its service for mobile deviceson Monday. USA Today broke details of the news, whichweve confirmed with sources at the company.The app will initially be available for Android and in the U.S. only, but the move is telling of the Google-owned companys ambitionto develop its service beyond just being the worlds largest repository of online videos. It already has itsMusic Key service, and an ad-free version is reportedly on its way also.The kids app will surface content suitable for youngsters, as youd expect, andTechCrunch understands that itwill include a number of parental control features, such as a limiter that restricts the time ofeach session, and a sound toggle for muting and unmuting videos. The app will ship with content from a range of partners from the entertainment industry, including Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a range of high-profile YouTubers.In addition toproviding access to suitable content, the app will offer curated options to help find videos easily. Dedicated channels and playlists that span TV shows, learning experiences, exploration and music will be available.As someone with young kids myself, I can say that this app has been a long time coming. (The Information first revealed YouTubes plans back in March 2014.)My four- and six-year-old love videos (like most youngsters), but Ive always been somewhat wary of giving them extended time with YouTube. Theres a great selection (and volume) of content on the service, but there have been times when it auto-loads less appropriate videos when theyve finished watching something suitable ensuing a panicked rush as I grab my phone/tablet and frantically hit mute and switch to something else. Netflix, with its dedicated Kids service, is my go-to choice instead  and also books and real-life activities, becauseyou dont wantkids spending too much timeonline at a young age.(Fwiw, these inappropriate YouTube videos are often funny, expletive-laden takes on cartoon shows which auto-play after genuine kids shows.)My kids love Vines recently launched kids app  which shows child-friendly clips from the short video service  and YouTubes kids app seemslikely to be a hit, particularlyamong parents.
