Heres a curious bit of news out of Tesla this afternoon: theyre experimenting with a customer referral program. A few people  emphasis on few  are going to get Teslas new Model X SUV for free; others will get $1,000 bucks off for buying a Tesla based on word-of-mouth from existing owners.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk just sent out an email to Model S owners breaking it all down, but heres the gist of it:So, the big catch: you have to be an existing Tesla owner to really get a shot at the goods  not just a Tesla fan with a particular wealthy network of friends.Why do this? Tesla says theyve found that it costs them around $2,000 to sell a car through one of their stores  so with this, they want to see if they can make that sale without requiring them to keep opening new locations. If we can amplify word of mouth writes Elon, then we dont need to open quite as many new stores in the future.It also theoretically helps them increase sales in the many states that have banned car companies from selling directly to buyers, instead requiring them to sell through third party dealerships or online.Explicitly noting that the program is an experiment, Musk says this first test run will end on Oct. 31st. I have no idea if this will work or not, says Elon. If it works out, thats great. If not, well say that was a great experiment and move on.Want to learn everything you need to know about Tesla, fast?
