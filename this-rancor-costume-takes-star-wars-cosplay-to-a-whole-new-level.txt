Comic Con is full of Vaders, Boba Fetts, and Storm Troopers. But how many people can say theyve roamed the show in an ultra detailed, kind-of-terrifying Rancor costume?Just one  special effects artist Frank Ippolito.Built in just a month by Ippolito and a team of artists along with our friends over at Tested, the costume is about as intense as they get. My favorite trick of the whole project: as you may note, the Rancors eyes dont happen to fall in a place that offers the wearer much of a view to the outside world. So how do they keep him from running into walls and stepping on small children? Theres a camera hidden in one of the nostrils; inside the costume, hes wearing a pair of goggles that beams that camera feed to his eyes. (If you just want to see what the costume looks like all together and in motion, skip to 4:30 or so. The first few minutes are a making of  which, dont get me wrong, is pretty great in its own right.)
