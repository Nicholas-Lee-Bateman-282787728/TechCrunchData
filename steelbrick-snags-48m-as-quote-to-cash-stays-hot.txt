SteelBrick, the quote-to-cash cloud service aimed primarily at small- and mid-market companies, announced a $48 million Series C round today.Quote-to-cash, as the name implies, is the part of the sales cycle that takes overonce you have an interested customer. While CRM tools like Salesforce.com and Microsoft Dynamics provide a waytomaintainthe basic customer record,a servicelike SteelBrick helpsyou put togethera quote, sign acontract when the customer has decided to buy, and take care of billingonce the deal is done.The tool is built on the SalesforceApp Cloud (formerly Salesforce 1) development platform.Apttus, a similar company also built on App Cloud, that aims at the enterprise side of the market,snared $108 million in September. For all the talk of investments slowing down, these two companies, and this market segment, seems be to defying that bit of conventional wisdom.It could be because its part of a large market, and businessesare increasingly seeing quote-to-cashas a critical investment, SteelBrick CEO Godard Abel told TechCrunch. Our competitors are growing as well  its a hot space. We saw this at the Dreamforce conference last month where several of the largest sponsors and booths were focused on quote-to-cash, including SteelBrick as a Titanium sponsor, he said.Todays investmentround was led by Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), with what the company calledsubstantial participation from existing investors Emergence Capital, Salesforce Ventures and Shasta Ventures.Its worth notingthat Salesforce Ventures has invested heavily in both Apttus and SteelBrick. It would seem that Salesforce could take over this part of the cycle if it wereso inclined, but when asked about this last month at Dreamforce, a Salesforce executive insisted it had no interest in this market. Instead, it seems content tolet itsventure arm invest inpartner companies like SteelBrick, built on top of the Salesforce platform, and let them handle it.With todays investment, the company hasraisedover $77 million, $66 million of which itcollected in two rounds this year alone.SteelBrick, which has been primarily known for configure, price and quote part of the sales cycle, completed the quote-to-cash trifectalast month when it purchased Invoice IT,and changed the productsname to SteelBrick Billing.The company sees its target market as organizations with 1-3500 employees. It claims it can get a customerlive in 5-10 weeks, which it also sees as a product differentiator.SteelBrick currently has350customers including Cloudera, Jive, Marketo and Nutanix.
