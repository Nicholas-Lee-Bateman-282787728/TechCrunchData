Europes refugee crisis is proving all but impossible for theregions politiciansto tacklewithout being sucked into an inglorious mire of prejudice  leaving desperatepeople fleeing conflict-torn countriesto beshunted towards the margins oreven sent backtothe places they were fleeing in the first place.In just one example this weekAustrias defense minister suggested the country willdeploy troops at itsborder with Italy, stepping up border controls to try toprevent more peoplefromentering.But while politicians feel the need topander to fear of migration, startups have the chance to do something both positive and practical  by using technology tools to overcome some of the challengesfaced by outsiders quicklyneeding to orient toa new life.One such startup is Austria-based online jobs platformRefugees Work, which was founded back in November and soft launched aroundtwo weeks ago taking registrations from employers wanting to hire refugees and refugees wanting to find localwork. Founder Dominik Beron says it has registered more than 130 employers so far, and hasaround1,000 refugees signed up to create a jobs profile tolook for work.The platform is not actively doing any jobsmatching yet but hetells TechCrunchit will switching this on in threeweeks, using an algorithm to link refugees with potential jobs based on four factors: their background skills, language, place of residence, and the specific legal environment ofan individuals work status.Beronprofesses some surprise at how quicklyemployers have signedup at this nascent stage, saying the original target was to on-board400 employers in 2016. As it turns out theyve managed more than a quarter of that in just a couple of weeks  with 50 signing up after just one day. They havealso initially been focusing on registeringrefugees but will now be pushing the b2b sales side specifically so are presumably hoping to maintain or even accelerate employer sign-up momentum from here on in.While he saysmanyemployers are seeking low qualification workers or hoping to fill positions they find it hard to source staff forlocally, such as jobs in gastronomyand hotels, othersare looking for more specialized skills, such as in academia, or are aimingto boost the diversity of their own workplace.We have companies who are looking to create a very special organizational structure such as companies who also have a high value for diversity and values like that, particularly international companies, says Beron.Onebig blocker to refugees being hired isthe complexity of the local legal environment vis-a-vis theirwork status, with companies not knowing how or even whether they can employee people. The platform aims to helpwith this bybeing a resource for relevant legal information,and by incorporating the workstatus of each individual into its jobsmatching algorithm  so an employer shouldntbe matched with a person they cannotlegally employ.Another area the techaims to help with is with integrating refugees into an existing workplacebyoffering resources to help with cultural fit issues or other integration-related concerns that employers may have and which might be preventing them from actively seeking to employee refugees, says Beron.Technology can be the perfect link connecting these two words, he argues. Primarily the biggest advantage [of using technology tools to help refugees] is scalability. Because they can register, they can use Facebook sign in we easily match them so we make something possible that would not be possible on an offline basis.One specific feature he cites as a useful bridging tech isan embedded messaging plus calendar tool thats being built into the platform  offering an easy channelforrefugees and employers to reach each other.Refugees are communicating on Facebook and WhatsApp and companies are communicating on email. So what we can do about this is we will make a chat with an integrated calendar that helps to create the universal channel for communication on our platform. It also helps us to know when refugees and companies meet so that we can support automated features by, for instance, sending refugees more information on how to behave in interviews, he adds.How has the startupbeen getting the word out about its platform torefugees who Beron notes are typically rather hard to reach by traditional media channels or mainstreamsocial media? By partneringwith local NGOs, going to refugee camps and by running free workshops for refugees on legal issues.After that awareness has been spreading byword of mouth viarefugees own social networks.Refugees are not very well connected to our society but they are very well connected to each other, adds Beron.Last year in Austria alone some 90,000 refugees arrived; Beron says its expected around 70,000 of those will remain in the country. Currently there are around 30,000 refugees with free access to the local labor market by his reckoning, with the rest being restricted to only certain kinds of employment as their asylum applications are processed.While RefugeesWork.atisclearly a social enterprise, it isalso a traditional startup in the sense that Beronhasambitions to scale it intoa sustainable companyin its own right. And while he says heinitially wanted to gift the codeto an NGO he couldnt find any willing to take on the project  so decided to build it into a business himself.The problem is capacity NGOs do not have either the personnel resources  so people who are experienced in building a platform or something like this  but also time. They were all busy transferring goods and donations in goods and donations in cash to refugees so they had no resources to implement such a project.The business model involvescharging employers a subscription fee for access to the platform, with the amount being charged varying depending on the size of the employer. For larger employers the fee starts at 500 per year.Beron, who is a lawyer by training, had previouslyfoundedanothersocial enterprise startup  a not-for-profit platform aiming toconnect social enterprises/NGOs with companies to get free services (such as making websites)  and it was while working on that thathe came up with the idea for Refugees Work after being approached by acompany wanting to employee a refugee butnot knowing how to go about doing so.They werelooking for a lawyer who could help, he says. That was the first contact with the whole topic of labour market integration of refugees.The startup has takenin $10,000 via a successful crowdfunding campaign to get its platform this far butBeron says its now actively looking for investors and is hoping to close a seed round soon.It is alsoworking on the first co-operation outside Austria, with a plan to scale to other European marketsin time. Although Beronnotes thisneed to be done ona social franchise basis because of the need to partner with local NGOs in order to reach the target pool ofrefugees.
