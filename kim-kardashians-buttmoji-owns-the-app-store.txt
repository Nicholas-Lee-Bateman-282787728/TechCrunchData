It seems like 2015 was the year of the emoji. I mean, a damn emoji was the word of the year. This year is ending with a massive bang on the App Store thanks to Kim Kardashian and herassets.Fire up the App Store on your devices and heres what youll see for the top paid app:The app, KIMOJI, costs $1.99. What do you get? Well, emojis having to do with Kim Kardashian, of course. Not bad for a keyboard app, eh?It currently has 2 stars, so maybe people arent getting as much out of it as they thought. The initial popularity certainly spun up tons of interest though, as the App Store magically went down during the flurry of asscitement:Apple, I'm so sorry I broke your App Store!!!
