IBM is taking another step to expand its WatsonAIbusiness and build its presencein areas like IoT: today the company announced that its acquisition of the Weather Company  the giant weather media and data group  has now officially closed.IBM is not disclosing the value of thedeal: it was originally reported to be in the region of $2 billion, butsources close to IBM tell us this wasinaccurate.(For context, the Weather Company was previouslyacquired in 2008 for $3.5 billion by a consortium that included Bain, Blackstone and NBC Universal.)As part of the deal, IBM is making somechanges: First, the Weather Companys cloud platform will now run on IBMs Cloud data centers (recall that it once was a big client of AWS). That platform will now power all of IBMs wider push into data services and WatsonsInternet of Things business. This will bring a massively bigger amount of datainto the mix, covering what IBM describes as billions of IoT sensors.IBM will also use its weight to scalethe Weather Companys business: the company plans to expand weather.cominto five more markets including China, India and Brazil immediately, as well as integrate it into IBMs 45 global cloud centers.IBM is also making an executive change: David Kenny, who had been the CEO of the Weather Company, will take on a newly-createdroleat IBM running the companys wider Watson platform business.The IBM acquisitionwill include most  but not all  of the Weather Companysassets: its B2B, mobile and cloud properties; weather.com; Weather Underground; The Weather Company brand; andWSI, which houses all the companys data science and enterprise services will all fold into Big Blue.The Weather Channel  perhaps the Weather Companys most mainstreamproduct is not included. But as part of the sale, under a long-term contract, itwill licenseweather data forecasts and analytics now owned by IBM.IBM and theWeather Company had already been working together as partners IBM cut a deal in 2015 to tap into the Weather Companys network of 100,000 weather sensors to ingest data for its machine-learning-basedanalytics services. Theacquisition will now give IBM ownership of the companys tech, and help itdeliver more services around the weather vertical to current and existing IBM customers.IBM also plans tobuild on theplatform created by the Weather Company, expanding it to include otherdatasets.I think the weather platform is not just about weather data, Kenny said in an interview today. Obviously we ingest more weather data than others and process it in the cloud for pilots, insurers or farmers or ordinary citizens to make better informed decisions. But that platform can be reused for other unstructured data sets this will be helpful for IBM in other business areas. What we have figuredout at the Weather Company, and IBMwill continue to explore across more IoT applications,is how to take datafrom lots of places and turn that into decisionsto help make things work.One example he cited was in the area of connected cars  an area where we have heard IBM is looking to do more business down the road.The same platform that might take in weather data can now also ingest data around other automotivedetails around speed, or mileage, or tire pressure and other diagnostics or wider traffic conditions, to feed back information to the car companies for future products, or to the drivers or cars themselves to drive better.The Weather Companys cloud data platform already had a track record before coming to IBM: it powers the fourth most-used mobile app daily in the U.S., IBM points out, and it handles26 billion inquiries to its cloud-based services daily.Andwhile Internet of Things applications like this may be an obvious endpoint, they are not the only area that Kenny as the new platform head will oversee, or whereWeather Company data will be used.Kenny said that there are already at least 500 companies using Watson-based machine learning data, spanning applications inareas like healthcare, travel and retail services. The idea will beto create more intelligent analytics for these groups leveraging the Weather Co. datasets. (The proverbial Butterfly Effect made into an IT service, so to speak.)IBM more generally has makinga big push to bring the company into the next generation of computing. In part, this is to help offset declines in more legacy IT services businesses. Its Global Technology Services and Global Business Services, as well as its software division, all declined in the last quarter, while cloud, mobile and analytics services all grew.These newer areas are stillmuch smaller than the legacy business, however, and IBM has seen 15 straight quarters of revenue decline. So its a slow, ongoing process of transformation, as CEO Ginny Rometty might say.Kenny is not ruling out more acquisitions down the line. My goal is to make Watson a robust platform and a leader in cognitivecomputing. Where there are places where you can go faster of course we will look at acquisitionsbut I would say this is about building a platform, its not a roll up or anything like that.Other execs on the Watson team includeHarriet Green, head ofWatson IoT, Education and Commerce, andDeborah DiSanzo, who leads Watson Health.Michael Rhodin, who launched the Watson business and drove the formation of Watson Health and Watson IoT, will now lead Watson business development where hell identify the next Watson verticals and related acquisition strategy.The Weather Company, meanwhile, will be led by Cameron Clayton, who was most recently its president, product and technology.
