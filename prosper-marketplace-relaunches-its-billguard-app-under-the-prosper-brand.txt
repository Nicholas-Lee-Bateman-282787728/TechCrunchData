ProsperMarketplace, the marketplace lender focused on refinancing and creditrehabilitation, has re-launched its BillGuardapp (acquired last September) under its own brand as Prosper Daily.With the rebranding, the former BillGuard becomes Prospers first mobile app and is the companys first beachhead into what chief executive Aaron Vermut hopes will be a broader suite of mobile products.The move brings the marketplace lender in line with a range of financial services companies that are offering one-stop windows into a users total financial history.The Prosper Daily app will offer BillGuards budgeting and spending tracking services, alerts for potential fraudulent charges, and credit monitoring.Getting people into an installment loan off of a high rate credit card can change and improve their life, says Vermut, responding to criticism that the company only operates as a quasi-payday lending service. We bought BillGuard to help us to continue to achieve our goal of helping customers achieve their own goals of getting on top of their finances.Vermut argues that the financial tools that give borrowers a window into their finances are equally as helpful as the companys 12% to 13% loans  which, he said, are still lower than credit card fees.Under the Prosper brand, BillGuards services wont change much. Already users have the option to optimize their credit through a button in the app that links to Prospers lending service.Vermut views the mobile app as a way to engage with potential customers even if those people cant receive Prosper loans. We turn away a lot of people from Prosper, he said. We should be giving them this app so we can become a trusted partner in their financial life.Ultimately, Prospers strategy is to expand its services through new mobile apps.We look at ourselves as a fintech company that is designing unsecured credit products for the middle class consumer, Vermut said.That means the company could be coming up with new ways to deliver loans based on the financial information it gleans from the Prosper Daily app, Vermut said.
