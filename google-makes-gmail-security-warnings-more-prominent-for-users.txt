Google is increasing the visibility of security warningsinside Gmailto help protect the services billion-plus active users more adequately.The company is expanding its safe browsing security notifications, which warn users when they are about to open suspicious links contained within emails, so that they show before the link has opened and as a full-page notice. Previously the warning would display before a link was clicked, but with greater prominence post-click Google hopes to cut down on users actuallyvisiting malicious sites.Google is also expanding itsstate-sponsored attack warnings inside Gmail, which others like Facebook have since embraced,so that they are full-page, too. These dont impact a lot of people  just 0.1 percent of users will ever be served this kind of notice, Google said  but they can behugely impactful.The users that receive these warnings are often activists, journalists, and policy-makers taking bold stands around the world, Google said in a blog post.Google is also continuing its ongoingpush to standardizeemail encryption, another feature thats crucial for activists and others who can be subject to hacking and surveillance. The company teamed up with a number of major names this week  includingComcast, Microsoft, and Yahoo  to propose a new system for email that promises to increase message security.Thats not going to be implemented overnight, andGoogle has long sought to increase the use of encryption in email using its own services. Last month, it began warning Gmail userswhen they send and receive email over unsecured connections and, already, the company said that introduction has helped to increase the amount of inbound email sen to Gmail usersover an encrypted connection by 25 percent.Were very encouraged by this progress! Given the relative ease of implementing encryption and its significant benefits for users, we expect to see this progress continue, Google said.
