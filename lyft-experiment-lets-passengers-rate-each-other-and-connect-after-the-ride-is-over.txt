It reads like the plot of an awful but inevitable romantic comedy: two strangers share a Lyft Line. Sparks fly; love blooms. Just as passenger No. 2 is working up the guts to ask passenger No. 1 on a date, passenger No. 1 arrives at their destination  in a rush, of course  and disappears into the night. LOVE LOST.Or is it?Lyft is experimenting with allowing Line passengers to reconnect after the ride is over. Its currently testing the feature in San Francisco, weve learned.While it has the potential to be awful and creepy if done wrong, theyre doing it in such a way that ought to keep the creep factor to a minimum.Its really two test features in one:This opt-in setup should keep Lyft from turning into an endless source of frustration for anyone who just, you know, wants a ride to work. If one person isnt interested in sparking up a friendship or what have you, they simply do nothing. Dont rate the other person, and their note will never be displayed.You can also rate other passengers negatively  at which point youll be offered a link to Lyfts support line if complaints are in order. The option to rate other passengers currently only appears in the post-ride email receipt for Lyft Line users in SF.So why might they do this? If nothing else, it fits with their early messaging. From the goofy stache to the now mostly abandoned fist bump, theyve always played on this idea that youre sharing a ride with a network of friends; now, with Lyft Line notes, youre making new friends. Hurray, friendship!And for the curious: outside of general data collection and the sending of notes, Lyft tells me that the passenger-to-passenger ratings currently have no impact on the service. So if you get a bunch of :( just because you dont like to talk on the way home from work, youre not getting booted from Lyft Line.[thanks for the heads up, kulveer]
