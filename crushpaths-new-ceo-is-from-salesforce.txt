Crushpath, a service that helps marketers more easily find leads, has hired Andy MacMillan as its CEO.MacMillan formerly led Data.com at Salesforce, and joined earlier this month.Marketers work with Crushpath to decide where to advertise their products and produce copy that will be attractive to potential clients. Once a lead lands on a marketers landing page and converts to what could be a sale, those marketers get an email to follow up with them.MacMillan, though happy with his position at Salesforce, took a meeting with Social+Capital founderChamathPalihapitiya, who convinced him to take a look at Crushpath. He walked through the companys traction and the market trends he was seeing, which led to a meeting with the co-founder of the company and then his eventual hire.Salesforce wasawesome.
