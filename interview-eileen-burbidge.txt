Earlier in the week I caught up with Eileen Burbidge, co-founder and partner at London-based venture capital firm Passion Capital and one of the most prominent figures in the U.K. technology scene.In what turned out to be a pretty candid interview we discussed a range of topics including her investment strategy and what she calls founder psychosis, her close ties to the U.K. government (and that infamous letter she signed supporting the return of a Conservative-led administration), the upcoming EU in-out referendum, and women in technology.Burbidge also talked about her early days working at Apple and Skype, and how she was actually fired from the Internet calling company shortly before it was sold to eBay for $2.6 billion.You can listen to the full interview below.
