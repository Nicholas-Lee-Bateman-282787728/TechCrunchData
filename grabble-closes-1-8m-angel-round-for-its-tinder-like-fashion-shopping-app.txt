Various startups out there are trying to create either an Instagram or Tinder for fashion, ultimately leading the buyer towards a purchase. This is the Holy Grail and you will easily uncover a multitude of companies trying to achieve something along these lines, even though the approaches and business models vary. In Europe the main players are new-ish startups like ASAP 54 (a TechCrunch Battlefield alumni), Shopcade, Snap Fashion and longer-player Mallzee. Some take an inventory approach, pulling feeds from retailers, some take an algorithmic image identification approach like Snap Fashion. One of the newer players is Grabble, an iOS and Android app whos Tinder-like interface has piqued the interest of users.Its now closed a 1.2 million ($1.8m) funding round from a number of Angels.
