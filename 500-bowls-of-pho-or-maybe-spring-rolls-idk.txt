500 Startups, the U.S.-led VC firm, is continuing its push into Southeast Asia after it hired two partners in Vietnam, a signal that it may be about to launch a local fund for startups the country.There are plenty of reasons why Vietnam is attractive for investors right now.With a population of 90 million, more than half of whom are aged under 30, it is a mobile-first marketwith hugepotential for technology and internet businesses. (A recent New York Times story looked at the rise of entrepreneurs and startups there.) 500 Startups is best known for its Silicon Valley accelerator programbuthas been active in Asia  and other parts of the world  for a few years, and itrecently extended its 500 Durians fund for Southeast Asiaby a further $5 million.In Vietnam, it has hired Binh Tran, formerly CTO and co-founder of Klout, and Eddie Thai, a local startup advisor who spent time working with Fortune 500 companies in the U.S., to act asits eyes and ears.Khailee Ng, 500 Startups Southeast Asia-based Managing Partner, offered no comment whenwe asked if500 Startups isplanninga dedicated fund in Vietnam, but it almost certainly isgiven the launch of its $10 million fund for Thailand  500 Tuktuks  earlier this year. That Thai microfund began with the hiring of two local venture partners, too.500 Startups  which has made over 1,000 investments across the world, including the U.S., Africa, India and beyond has already completedthree dealsin Vietnam, and Ng said the plan is to do 20 more deals over the next year. (Again, another sign of an imminent local fund.)Highlighting the high use of mobile internet versus desktop and the young population, Ng told TechCrunch that Vietnam has all the right pieces, but not enough VCs.Media has been rife with speculationthat 500 Startups is raising a fund in Vietnam, and, referencing its fund inThailand, it appears that the firms approach to Southeast Asia is two-sided.Local, country-specific micro-funds provide early-stage funding to get initial ideas and startups off the ground  500 Tuktuks will cut checks at a $75,000 average andis expected to cover nearly 70 deals  and follow-on funding for businesses that gain traction. 500 Durians, the fund that Ng leads which covers regional companies, provides the next step in the funding process for those ready to expand beyond their domestic markets. The firm alsorunsapost-funding program based out of Malaysia, which launched last month.Its an interesting but long-tailed strategy in Southeast Asia, a region that  to date  has been dominated by investors from Singapore and Japan who typically prefer to invest atpost-seed stages where the signal-noise ratio is lower andthe potential payout from an exit ishigher.
