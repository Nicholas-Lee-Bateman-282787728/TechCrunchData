If youre a night reader on your mobile device, then you know that its hard to get tired with the bright screen burning your eyeballs. This of course isnt a problem with physical books, as you can add a soft light to the room to wind down.Google Play Books wants to emulate that softer experience with a feature it calls Night Light. As the evening goes on, it gradually filters out the blue light from your screen to make flipping through pages more comfortable.Heres what the team had to say about the new feature:When turned on, Night Light gradually filters blue light from your screen, replacing it with a warm, amber light as the sun sets. Night Light automatically adapts to the amount of natural sunlight outside based on the time of day, giving you just the right temperature and brightness. The color adjustment is more comfortable on your eyes and greatly improves low-light night reading.The feature is rolling out to Android and iOS now. To activate the feature, just update the Google Play Books app. Once you open the app, youll get a prompt to turn on the automatic mode.
