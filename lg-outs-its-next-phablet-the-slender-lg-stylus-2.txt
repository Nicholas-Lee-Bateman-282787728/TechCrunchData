Theresless than a week to go until LGs pre-MWC press conference, where the company is expected to lift the veil on a new flagship smartphone, the LG G5. But the South Korean mobile maker has another handset to show off in Barcelona  which its justannounced today.The 5.7 inch LG Stylus 2 is the follow on phablet to the G4 Stylus, which launched in May last year. The screen size of the sequel is the same but LG has shaved a few millimeters off the thickness, with the Stylus 2 measuring just 7.4mm vs 9.4mm for last years model.Its also a few grams lighter, weighing in at 145g vs 163g for the G4 Stylus.Despite being so slender the phablet does include an SD card for user expandable memory. It also packs a 3,000mAh removable battery.Another changed is a tweak to the bundledstylus, whichLG is now calling a pen. It says the new stylushas a nano-coated tip  for, it claims, enhanced accuracy vs the rubber-tippedstylus of 2015s phablet. Its also touting a new Calligraphy Pen font which is says will let people write with the stylusas if it werea fountain pen.Another new feature aims to avoid phone and stylus being separated, so the phone will pop up a warning message when the handset is detected to be in motion yetthe stylus bay is empty. So no more stylus separation anxiety.Under the hood of the Android 6.0 device theres a1.2GHz Quad-Core chip, 1.5GB RAM and 16GBof internal storage (user expandable as noted above), so in classic phablet style its not going to be treading on the toesof the top of the range smartphone flagships.Round the back, theres a 13MP camera situated near LGs now trademark rear power key placement (love it or hate it). And the handset will come ina choice of three colors:white, brownand titan (aka acharcoal/metallic shade).Theres no specific confirmation of pricingyet but LG saysthe price-tag will beof a mid-tier phone  adding thatits aiming the handset firmly at the mass-tier segment (aka where theres still some growth to be found in smartphones).The company will be showing the Stylus 2 at MWC next week. TC will be on the ground in Barcelona to get hands on so stay tuned.
