Chinese internet firm Tencent announcedits latest financial results today, but one of the standout figures isnt a financial stat. Its that its messaging services, which include blockbuster mobile app WeChat  one of the services that is inspiringFacebooks plans for its Messenger business  now has 200 million users credit cards boundto it.Tencent pulled in a net profit of7.584 billion RMB ($1.2 billion)on revenue of26.594 billion RMB ($4.2billion),and messaging is a huge part of that. WeChat and Weixin(the Chinese version of the servicethat includes localized services and bells and whistles) collectively account for 650 million monthly active users (MAU), while QQ, its instant messaging service that started out on desktop, counts639 million smartphone users.Tencents QQ Wallet and Weixin Pay, which run on the two aforementioned services, areonly available in China and, since the company doesnt break out its WeChat/Weixin user numbers by location, it is impossible to say what proportionofusers in China have added their card to their account. But the rising number is impressive and likely to worry Alibaba, which runs rival mobile payments service Alipay. While Alipay leans on Alibabas vast e-commerce network for visibility, a service attached to a messaging app that people open regularly has the potential to be a lot more convenient to users and merchants alike.Tencent has placed huge emphasis on enabling payments. Beyond supporting offline transactionsin a similar way to Apple Pay and others, the Weixin service can be used to pay bills, make person-to-person transfers, buy items online, and more.If youre keen to connect the dots on where Facebook Messenger, Snapchat and others in the West are headed, Weixin is a product to watch.But replicating WeChats early payments success  and it is still too early to call it aproven success in that area will be challenging for those outside of China.Weixin benefits from the legacy of QQ, Chinas arguably less competitive payments space (versusthe U.S.), and the success of clever campaigns around Chinese New Year and other festivals during which the gifting of money is common.While the payments services have huge potential, games continue to be the big revenue generator for Tencent on mobile. This past quarter, revenue from titles on QQ and WeChat/Weixin  which monetize by selling in-app purchases rose 27 percent year-on-year to reach14.3billion RMB, or $2.25 billion. That includes PC-based games on the desktop QQ service, however, but Tencent said mobile was abig driver.Advertising is also an area where Tencent is seeing revenue jumponmobile. A controversial move to monetize Moments, the social network feed inside WeChat/Weixin, helped grow performance-based advertising revenues to 2.4billion RMB ($380 million) during the quarter.Tencents total ad revenue  across mobile and desktop, and including its popular video site and news portals  came in at4.9 billion RMB, thats around $770 million.
