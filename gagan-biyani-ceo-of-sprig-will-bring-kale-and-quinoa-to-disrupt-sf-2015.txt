Gagan Biyani, CEO Of healthy food delivery startup Sprig, will be joining us this year at Disrupt SF. In case you dont remember, Biyani is a TechCrunch alum, having covered mobile apps for almost two years at MobileCrunch.Sprig has raised $56.7 million in funding from prestigious investors such as Greylock Partners, Social+Capital, Accel Partners and Battery Ventures.Although Sprigs menu is limited in options for a reason and meals arrive no later than 20 minutes after you place the order within their app. The cost is somewhere around $10, which is awesome for the type of healthy options that Sprig offers. All of the food is prepared in its own kitchen by some high-profile professional chefs.It wasnt possible to do what Sprig was doing 5 to 10 years ago, Sprig CEO Gagan Biyani told us earlier this year.Biyani will be able to chat with us about what its like to scale a business of Sprigs popularity so quickly, and hopefully shed some light on how the options on the menu are chosen.On-demand anything is hot, and Sprig has stood out in the crowd, so join us for a chat with Biyani at Disrupt this year.To hear all these excellent speakers and more at Disrupt SF 2015at San Franciscos historic Pier 70 you can purchase tickets(at special early-bird prices) righthere.Our sponsors help make Disrupt happen.
