Though the four-year-old online platform Codecademy now teaches employable tech skills to 25 million users around the globe, itstill doesntcharge for its services,some early testing notwithstanding.The company is choosing instead to remain focused on growth before introducingwhatCEO Zach Sims describes as a prosumer business.In todays market, thats an unusual stance to maintain. Its even moreunusual because Codecademy has raised just $12.5 million over the years, a small sum by the standards of most online learning platforms. Thesix-year-old, San Francisco-based online learning and teaching marketplace Udemy, for example, has raised $113 million to date.In a sit-down in Davos, we asked Sims about Codecademys strategy; whether hes feeling nervous about waiting so long to charge (or else raise more capital); and if Codecademy might eventually branchinto the seeminglylucrative business ofcoding boot camps.Spoiler alert: Simsthinks thatCodecademy is far better positioned to survive and thrive than the many startups that have raised piles of cash and are now having to right-size their businesses.The entire interview runs around nine minutes long, but to catchthe portion of the interview where we start discussing the business side of Codecademy, skip to the 4:15 mark.
