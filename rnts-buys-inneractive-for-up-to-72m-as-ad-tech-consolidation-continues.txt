RNTS, the Germanparent company of Fyber(formerly known as SponsorPay) and Heyzap, continues itsrun ofad tech acquisitions. Today the company announced that it has acquired Inneractive, an Israeli-based real-time bidding and mobile ad exchange, for $46 million in cash, plus up to $26 million in earn-outs and retention payments, with the deal expected to complete in Q2.This is a good exit for Inneractive. Co-founded in 2007 byZiv Elul and Offer Yehudai, the startup had raised only $11.5 million in funding in that time, with backers including Kreos and Evergreen Venture Partners. Inneractive said it had revenues of $43.2 million in 2015 and was profitable, and projects to double revenues in the next two years.The news comes about two monthsafter RNTS announced that it had closed its $45 million Heyzap acquisition, as well as another acquisition of Falk Realtime for $11 million in 2015.RNTS says that the new assets will make it one of the largest independent mobile supply-side platforms, with its services covering mediation, exchange and ad service across mobile, web and other platforms. Others that compete on supply-side platforms include Google and Doubleclick; OpenX and AOL/Verizon (owner of TechCrunch).In the ad game, scale is of prime importance to help in areas like adding more liquidity to the wider platform and optimizing pricing revenue per unique user; and this deal will help RNTS have more scale.Inneractive said it had a user reach of 630 million monthly active users in 180 countries, while Fyber claimed over 500 million, helping the wider company now reach over 1 billion MAUs globally.This is another milestone for RNTS on our path to building the leading supply-side platform for the mobile app economy.
