Uber surprised China watchers this month when itsaid it isprocessing one million rides per day in the country. That impressive number, which leaked out via a letter to investors, is nowdwarfed by arch rival Didi Kuaidis claim that it is seeing three times as muchdemand inthe country.The Wall Street Journal reports that in Yet Another Leaked Memo To Investors,Didi Kuaidis chief executive Cheng Wei revealed that the company  formed by a merger between Chinas top two ride hailing firmsthis year  now handles three million trips each day. That, Cheng claimed, is triplethe volume that it saw as recently as May.Such quickgrowth may see Didi Kuaidi, which is raising money right now to battleUber, increase its newest fundraising efforts from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Thats at an apparent valuation of $15 billion, the Journal claimed.These ride per dayfigures are, of course, company issued facts, so it remains to be seen just how accurate they are. Didi Kuaidi claims to own 80 percent of Chinas taxi app market, while Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in his letter to investors  UberChina is raising $1 billion  that his firm has 50 percent marketshare but dominates Chinas nascent peer-to-peer taxi space.They both cant be right, and there is clearly some fuzzy maths going on somewhere, or perhaps in both places.Uber, Didi Kuaidi and other taxi apps are seemingly more prone to fake drivers and passengers in China than other parts of the world, but its hard to know exactly what proportion of rides are not genuine. A recent report speculated that millions of Uber rides arebogus drivers and passenger partner up to fake rides without even stepping into a vehicle, taking advantage of lucrative subsidies  but that report conflicted since it was publishedby Tencent Tech, a service run by Tencent which is a Didi Kuaidi investor.It could well be that the new war on subsidies is encouraging Chinese drivers and passengers to increase forged rides and thus producing these impressive growth figures, or perhaps the Didi Kuaidi merger coupled withUbers investment fromChinese search giantBaidu  not to mention the ongoing legal skirmishes  is raising awareness with consumers who are using these services more frequently. The real answer is likely a combination of all factors, butits hard to know for sure at this point.
