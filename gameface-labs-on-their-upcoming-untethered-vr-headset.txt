Yesterdayon the CES TechCrunch Hardware Battlefield stage I sat down with Edward Mason, Founder and CEO of VR Headset startup GameFace Labs.Founded in London, GameFace Labs makes a self-contained VR headset, meaning it doesnt need to be attached to an external computer like Oculus or other headsets that require a high-powered gaming rig.GameFace Labs first device will ship in 2017, but I had a chance to try on a beta version yesterday, which I was pleasantly surprised by.Afterwords, I talked with Mason about the future of virtual reality, what its like building VR startup in London, and the difficulties of converting the masses to VR.
