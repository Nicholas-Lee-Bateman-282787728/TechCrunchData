Its Friday, so you can probably spare a few minutes to watch a heartwarming little 360-degree animated film, the latest in Googles Spotlight Stories. This one, entitled Pearl, takes place entirely inside a beat-up 80s sedan, and traces the story of a girl and a guitar. It made its debut at the end of Googles Bridging the physical and digital session at I/O today.Directed by Patrick Osborne, an Oscar-winning animator whos worked on a number of big recent CG films, Pearl has a sort of lo-fi charm to it. I was reminded of both the stylized earnestness of Life is Strange and the old-school flat-shaded rotoscoping of Flashback and Another World.Its no coincidence that games came to mind  Pearl isnt captured in 360 the way an ordinary video is. Instead, it is an actual 3D environment being rendered in real time  in a game engine that Googles ATAP team has reduced to less than a megabyte.Apparently thats hard, quipped Osborne on stage. His job, of course, was to craft a story, not an engine  something that can be difficult when the user can look anywhere and choose not to pay attention to what might be important story elements.Osborne, a confessed control freak, decided to create a road trip musical and restrict the viewer to the passenger seat, from which vantage he could inconspicuously frame action by using the cars natural geometric elements.As with other 360-degree compositions, you might miss a few things the first time round  thats by design, really. As Googles Spotlight Stories tech lead Rachid El Guerrab said before introducing Osborne, this is a major challenge.He showed a few techniques for guiding the users attention  changes in music, helper characters that bring you back the actions focus, and so on. But the only real solution seems to be multiple viewings  and in order to accommodate that, its worthwhile for the director and team to make sure theres content in all directions.This is, of course, not every directors preference, and what some see as advantages provided by 360 may hamper the style of others. Pearl seems to strike a balance between traditional and 360-degree composition  make it full screen (hit one of the high resolutions, too) and see how you like it.
