Theres no shortage of services trying to drive traditional financial planners into extinction. Think Wealthfront, Personal Capital, Betterment and Intuit-owned Mint.com, among them.Today, another company personal finance tools companyis publicly joining the fray: aboutLife, a three-year-old, San Francisco-based, eight-person startup that quietly raised $3 million in Series A funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers some time ago.Founder and CEO Rajat Kongovia former project leader at Boston Consulting Group who later served as COO of the social network hi5says he decided to createthe company after having his second daughter a few years ago.As he tells it, like 86 percent of Americans, he had all these financial tasks I hadnt sorted out: life insurance, college funds, how to save for retirement. He says he used both Mint and Wealthfront but that it still took him two weeks to put together a picture of his competing goals. He adds thatonce he did (via Excel spreadsheet), it was something his friends asked to borrow, so he decided tocreate a service that puts this together for free.Indeed, unlike many current servicesthat chargeusersapercentage of assets under management, aboutLifes business model centers on referrals. It will charge afee, say, to amutual fund company every time aboutLife sends a potential customer its way.The companydoesnt have many such fund options yet; its not a priority,says Kongovi, explaining that the ideaover timeis to help get users into whatever savings accounts and mutual fund plans theyre asking that the platform include.Right now, aboutLife isfar more focused on helping its users create financial plans quickly and easily, based on data analysis that createsa picture of a person based on a series of questions about him or her that build on each other.Asked how it plans to keepthose users engaged, Kongovi say aboutLife is targeting a certain demographic  40- and 50-year-olds  that tends to always have some sort of life event or something happening economically, says Kongovi.For them, he notes, whether its a kid who returns from college or taking care of their parents,things can change once a quarter.
