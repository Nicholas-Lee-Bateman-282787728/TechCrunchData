Hold on to your 1.21 gigawatts.Amazon is offering the Back to the Future trilogy for free to Prime members for the whole month of October.This year marks the 30th anniversary for BTTF. Super fans may recall October 21, 2015, is also the date Marty McFly heads into the future to see what can be done about his kids.In part II of the trilogy, Marty (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) head to the future with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in a flying car, powered by Mr. Fusions reusable compost, only to find a dystopian Hill Valley run by Martys (and his dads) nemesis Biff Tannin.The series takes us to the past, back to the future (heh), then way, way back to the 1800s and then, well, back to Oct 21, 1985.Its complicated. Its awesome. Its everything right with an 80s series attempting a guess at what might be the future technologies that await us and atime traveling Delorean that could take us there.Apartnership with Universal Pictures guarantees Amazon will be the exclusive subscription streaming home of BTTF  and its part of a push to add exclusive content to the platform. Both Hulu and Amazon plan to hook new viewers and sign-ups with special content. The Everything store is using this particular tactic to drum up interest in the 30th anniversary DVD/Blu-ray special edition bundle for the trilogy, setto launch on October 20.
