Walmart is making a notable to change to ShippingPass, its three-day shipping service and answer to Amazon Prime launched into beta testing last year. The company says this morning it will move from three-day delivery to two-day delivery  which makes the service far more competitive with Amazons similarly structured annual shipping program.This is an interesting move on Walmarts part, given that its original idea with ShippingPass was to compete by offering a delivery service thatsfaster than usual, but not quite as speedy as Amazon Prime. However, the advantage was that Walmart would undercut the cost of Prime in exchange for this delay.Walmarts ShippingPass customers paid half the price of an annual Prime Membership  ShippingPass is $49/year (down from $50/year previously), versus Amazons $99/year program andonly hadto wait one more day for their delivery.Now, they only have to wait two days  the same as with Prime.While Prime today is a membership program with a range of benefits, including access to free music, books, TV shows and movies, Walmart is focusing only on deliverywith its ShippingPass service. There are no other features.But its not the lack of benefits thats keeping the price down, says Walmart. Instead,the company explains that its able to offerfaster and more affordable shipping because it has a unique fulfillment network thatincludes new, large-scale fulfillment centers, stores, distribution centers and atransportation network.Walmarts shippingservice today offers subscribers access to more than a million items, including those most frequently purchased on Walmarts website. The website offers a wider selection of around 7 million items. That suggests Walmart may eventually choose to expand the selection for ShippingPass customers in the future.ShippingPassitems are delivered to customers doors in two days or less. There are also no minimum requirements to use ShippingPass, and free returns are supported, as well.Walmart has not yet disclosed any details about ShippingPass, like number of sign-ups, sales to date or its margins and impact to Walmart.coms revenue or bottom line.ShippingPass isnt broadlyavailable at this time, but interested customers can sign uphereto join a waitlist for the pilot program.
