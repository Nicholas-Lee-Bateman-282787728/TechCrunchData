Google hasannounceda change to its user consent policywhich will affect website publishers using Google products and services, including Google AdSense, DoubleClick for Publishers and DoubleClick Ad Exchange, as well aswhose sites or appshave visitors arriving from the European Union. Under the new policy, publishers will have to obtain EU end users consent before storing or accessing their data, says Google.The change, which is in direct response to the EUs cookie compliance regulations, follows the arrivalof the Google-published website calledCookieChoices, spotted earlier this month. That site was launched with the intention of helping digital publishers obtain toolsand access other resources that will aid in their obligations to obtain user consent, Google noted at the time.These tools include code that website publishers can use to inform visitors about their cookies, as well as those that can be used to directly obtain consent, like splash screens, notification bars, or one-time, pop-up alerts that can be used on mobile apps.SaysJason Woloz, Googles Security & Privacy Program Manager, Display and Video Ads, in a brief announcement posted today, it has always been Googles policy to comply with privacy laws, so weve agreed to make certain changes affecting our own products and partners using Google products.EU regulators have pushed for years for a variety of user protections when it comes to how web users data and information is tracked and made available online. One of its more-discussedrulings in recent months is related to the so-called Right to be forgotten, which legally requires that search engines like Google process individuals requests for the delisting of inaccurate, outdated and irrelevant data.Meanwhile, the EU has had regulations related to cookie-related data collection for quitesome time. But whats notable is that Google is applying this to its own services, while also challenging publishers to comply with the updated policy by a September 30th, 2015 deadline, according to an email sent out about the change. In addition, this policy will also affect those with iOS or Android applicationswho will have to show a message to app users upon first launch.While before, the EUs cookie policy has been common for those sites based in the EU, Googles policy changewill affect a number of publishers, as any site on the web could potentially have EU-based traffic.The effectiveness of cookie-related user consentnotifications is questionable, however. According to a late 2014 study on the matter, the EUs cookie-notification policy has cost billions of euros per year in terms of compliance costs for websites, but has offeredfew benefits to web users. That is to say, the implementations thus far have not changed user behavior, the report found.Unfortunately, Google cant offer a consent message that publishers can use, because awebsite or apps consent message should say will largely depend on your own uses of cookies and other information, and the third party services you work with, says Google. But it does offer pointers on the Cookie Choices website to help publishers get started.Googlespost also points to other resources beyond Cookie Choices, includinga Help Center FAQwhich details the answers to questions publishers may have, like which products are impacted, how to tell if a current policy is compliant, how the changes affect mobile websites, and more.Here, Google also explains that theArticle 29 Working Party, an umbrella body that comprises representatives of all EU data protection authorities, requested that changes were made to how site publishers request consent from end users. Google says it understands these principles will be applied across the industry, which is why its rolling out the change now.
