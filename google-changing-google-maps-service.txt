The issue blew up this week after searches forn***** or nigga were found to pull up the White House and other locations associated with African-Americans and other ethnic minorities.In a blog post apologizing for the mess up,Google explained that the situation was causedbecauseits Maps service uses content from across the web  most of which isnt vetted  to match searches to locations. Its the same model that its search engine is based on  and explains why a search forfailure used to serveU.S. President Geoge W. Bush as the top result, before the company implemented a change.Like Google search, which had algorithms changedto prevent so-called Googlebombing, so Maps is getting the same treatment to prevent the problem, Google said:Our team has been working hard to fix this issue. Building upon a key algorithmic change we developed for Google Search, weve started to update our ranking system to address the majority of these searchesthis will gradually roll out globally and well continue to refine our systems over time. Simply put, you shouldnt see these kinds of results in Google Maps, and were taking steps to make sure you dont.There had been theories that hackers were subverting Google Map searches in some way, but this appearsfalse, according to Googles explanation.That said, users tampering with maps is a genuine and very recent concern for the company. It was forced to shut down its Map Maker service, which allows anyone to contribute to developing GoogleMaps, after it was used for a series of obscene edits, including the addition of the Google Android logo peeing on the Apple logo.Map Makers shut down is not permanent, but Google did not provide any indication of when it will be back up and running.
