The founder of Yahoo-acquired Summly, Nick DAloisio, has left the company to focus on his philosophy and computer science schoolwork at Oxford, weve confirmed with DAloisio. During the summer, DAloisio did a stint at Airbnb as its Entrepreneur In Residence according to hisLinkedIn profile.Weve heard from multiple sources that DAloisio could be gearing up for his next startup chapter as his studies wind down some.The company acquired Summly for a rumored $30 million in 2013 and DAloisio, who will turn 20 soon, followed up his Summly work with the release of Yahoos News Digest app. That app won an Apple Design Award last June.When asked about DAloisios status, a Yahoo spokesperson told us: Nick has taken time to focus on his studies; he continues to be involved with Yahoo.That was something DAloisio discussed earlier this year, but his involvement level has clearly changed. Weve heard that the lines of communication are open between the two sides, so perhaps thats what the company was referring to.Theres been some executive movement at Yahoo over the past few weeks, including the departure of M&A chief Jackie Reses. The company recently shared its Q3 earnings report, and its stock continues to hover around the $35 mark.
