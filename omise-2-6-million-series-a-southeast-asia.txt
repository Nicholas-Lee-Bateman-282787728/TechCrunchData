Omise, a Thailand-based payment enabler, is in the money today after it raised a $2.6 million Series A round to develop its payment gateway system and expand across Asia.Two-year-old Omises funding was led by Indonesian VC SMDV, with participation from existing investor East Ventures. 500 Tuktuks  500 Startups dedicated fund for Thailand  and, interestingly,Thailand-based mobile operator True completed the line-up. (Working with a telco in Southeast Asia often open doors and scaling opportunities with both partners and consumers.)The timing of the round is noteworthy, comingjust a week after 2C2P, arival inSoutheast Asia, nabbed $7 million in fresh funding. Paysby, which is owned by operator DTAC, is yet another competitorin Thailand  there are plenty more across the region. The sheer number of entrepreneurs focused on the problem, indicates just how painful the currentsystemis forretailers, startups and others.So what is it about Omise that is different from the rest?Co-founder and COO Donnie Harinsut explained that, in essence, Omise  which is pronounced Oh-Mee-Say is bringing greater simplicity and ease to the existing process, which can certainly be a convoluted and frustrating one. The startup is the only one that is PCI 3.0 compliant in Thailand  which allows it to tokenize cards for one-click payments and ongoing subscriptions  while its onboarding and merchant support are likely to ease some of the pain points for those selling online.Most developers dont accept credit cards because there are so many obstacles some issues [including minimum deposits to banks and long wait times for payment to be completed] make it super hard for a new merchant to start their online business, hesaid.Omise  which actually started out as an e-commerce platform, before the team decided to focus on the payment gateway that it built for itself  offers a set of APIs and developer resources that can allow new merchants to be online and accepting payment with 24 hours, Harinsutexplained.On the business side, Omise charges 3.65 percent on transactions, with a one dollar fee for up to 60,000 (1 million THB) withdrawn. It offers customizable packages for large partners, and claims to serve a number of large corporates as well as smaller startups and SMEs  itdid not disclose the identity of its client roster, however.For now, Omise is focused on Thailand, where it has a 20-plus team, but its next step will be an expansion to Japan, the country of co-founder and CEO Jun Hasegawa, who met Harinsutmore than 10 years ago duringa homestay trip. The company is in the process of opening a Tokyo office, and is hiring both in Japan and Thailand right now.Hasegawa told TechCrunch that Omise has struck a deal with Japans biggest credit issuer and, while the local landscape is vastly different to Southeast Asia, hes confident that there is still a payment gap to be tackled. Even just taking a one percent share of Japans online sales market, which hepegs as reaching $600 billion per year by 2020, would make the move worthwhile, he explained.Southeast Asia is a more obvious target for growth, particularly given that SMDVled this funding round, but Harinsutand Hasegawa would not be drawn on further details other than that they have big plans for Indonesia.The company, they said, may also expand into offline payments  bringing their solution and more options to point-of-sale and in-store hardware  which might require a fresh funding round in early 2016.We want to help Southeast Asia quit using cash and move on to be a cashless society, Hasegawasaid.
