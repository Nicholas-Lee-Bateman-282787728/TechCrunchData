Less than a year after it brought on investors to help crack the Chinese market, Airbnb is going after another Asian mega-country with a billion-plus population: India.Airbnb turned to investors China Broadband Capital (CBC), Hillhouse Capital and Sequoia China in China, and ithas teamed up with media giantTimesof India Group in a deal focusedon localization and execution.The tie-in does also include a Times of India investment in Airbnb.Times of India said it will use its range of media, which includes newspapers/onlines Times of India and Economic Times, todrive awareness of Airbnb accommodations, and help Airbnbcreate a truly localized presence for India.We will provide support on operations, hiring, strategy and advertising, to make Airbnbs entry and operations in India as effective as possible,Satyan Gajwani, managing director of Times of Indias digital arm Times Internet, told none other than Economic Times.The deal for Airbnb, which raised a massive $1.5 billionfrom investors in December at a valuation of at least $25 billion,is similar to partnerships that Times of Indiahasstruck with other global tech firms keen toenter India, where growingsmartphone sales areprojected to drive the number of internet users past500 millionby 2017.Airbnb clearly sees that potential.Speaking last year, itshead of operationsVarsha Rao saidthat Indias travel market could be worth $40 billion within the next five years. Airbnb alreadyhas operations in India and last year it madeAmanpreet Bajaj, who founded Flipkart-ownedLetsBuy.com, its new country head, but nowit aims to go deeper.Some of Airbnbs stays in IndiaTimes Internet is an Uber investor-partner, while it has deals with Business Insider, Coursera, and Huffington Post among others.Times Internet caters to this segment of global expansion into India with Times Global Partners, an initiative that pools its resources to help with localization and India launches.Airbnb CTO and co-founderNathan Blecharczyksaid in a statement that the company is working on adapting ourproduct for the Indian market so that Indian travellers can live like a local anywhere in theworld.Like China, the market isnt just about overseas travel, theres plenty of money being spent inside Indias itself. And theres plenty of competition there, too,thanks to budget hotel networks like OYO Rooms, which landeda $100 million round led by Japans SoftBank last year. OYO Rooms, and others like it, are focused on offering astandardized hotel experience on a budget in India, where accommodation searching and booking remains an offline experience in many parts of the country. Airbnb, on the other hand, primarily sells itself as an experience marketplace  thats to say that each potential accommodation option is unique in a positive way. (According to its marketing, at least.)Airbnb seems likely to push its affordable stays while also seducing Indian consumers wanting to travel with its two million listings, which cover more than 34,000 cities across some190 countries worldwide.
