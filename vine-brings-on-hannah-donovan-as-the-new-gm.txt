Vine, the six-second, looping video platform from Twitter, has just hired Hannah Donovan as the new general manager.Donovan has built her career in product and design leadership. Her most recent position was product lead at Drip, which was recently acquired by Kickstarter.Some exciting news: I'm joining @vine as GM in May! Absolutely thrilled and humbled to work with this team   https://t.co/yqOhGWHx6f Hannah Donovan (@Han) March 29, 2016She has also held positions at MTV, last.fm and helped co-create This Is My Jam.Here is what a Vine spokesperson had to say about Donovan:Hannah brings experience in product and design leadership with a background in music and entertainment  areas that are particularly relevant and important to Vine. And she joins at a vital time, given that video is increasingly becoming a popular medium for communication and storytelling. While many companies are working to bring video into their products, Vine started out as a video company and has been focused solely on mobile video from day 1.Vines original GM was Dom Hoffman, one of the three cofounders of the service, all of which have left in the years following its pre-launch acquisition by Twitter. When Hoffman left, cofounder Colin Kroll took over the position.After Kroll left in April 2014, Jason Toff, who was also Director of Product Management at Twitter, took on the role. He has now moved on to be a Group Product Manager in the VR department at Google, according to LinkedIn.You can check out Donovans personal website here.
