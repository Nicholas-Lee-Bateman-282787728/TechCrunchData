Weve all had it happen. Youre typing away on your iPhone when autocorrect shifts the entire toneof your chat.Ducks become dicks or f**ks become ducks.Blonde girls go blind, and suddenlyeven the simplest message about groceries or a cake order becomes a horror story.We joke, but in the age of texting (let alone sexting), any change to our algorithmical spelling safety net can be disastrous.Thats why itsat least worth pointing out that  at least anecdotally  something seems to be going on with autocorrect on Apples devices these days.Apples notorious spelling tool has been more aggressive atducking with my messages on both iOS and OS X lately. And Im not the only one here at TC whos run afoul of Apples autocorrect app.This is anecdotal, of course, but nearly all of us are noticing that the normally somewhat helpful companion has been a bit more confident about mis-interpreting our word choicelately. Anyone else having more problems than usual getting the right words out?
