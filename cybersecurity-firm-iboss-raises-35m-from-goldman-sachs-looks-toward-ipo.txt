After 10years without any outside investment, cybersecurity firm iboss is finally raising itsSeries A. The companys presidentsaid that even now, the company, which has been profitable since it launched, really didnt need the money.The cloud-based security platformjust raised a $35 million Series A from Goldman Sachs Private Capital Investing group.Were kind of a bat more than we are a unicorn, Peter Martini said of the companys fundraising efforts. On that note, Martini declined to discuss the companys valuation in the round, only specifying that it was more than $500 million.So why did the founders of iboss, twin brothersPeter and Paul Martini, cut their total equity just to raisesome cash that, according to them, they didnt really even need?Raising money when you need money is great, PresidentPeter Martini said. But when you dont its kind of a hard proposition, like why do I need you?' Martini says the motivation was largely in terms of developing relationships with investors as the company looks towards an IPO in roughly the next 24 months.Nevertheless, wheres all that new capital headedtowards? Well, for starters the company just dropped $13 million in cash on a new global headquarters in San Diego to handle its ever-increasing R&D efforts.The companys technologies work by actively monitoring all network traffic,which allows it toprevent large-scale data breaches caused by malware that has made its way into the network and is poised to steal data, according to a companystatement.The raisewas also about validation, according to Martini, especially as the company looks to further expand its global operations. We wanted someone who was a global brand, had to be tier one and was a major powerhouse, Martini said.Goldman represented that for us.
