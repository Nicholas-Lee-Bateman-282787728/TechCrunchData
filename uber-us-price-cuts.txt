A big part of the reason Uber has raised two billion dollar funding rounds is that offering service is capital intensive. In some markets battling its rivals necessitates aggressive price cuts, while in others offering price reduction is a way to appeal to more consumers and widen awareness of its service.With that in mind, the company has announced plans to cut prices in 48 of its newer cities in U.S. that have no experienced cheaper rides as yet.Whats interesting about this impending mass price drop is that Uber is, for the first time, guaranteeing that drivers in cities with price cuts will actually make more money from its service.Were so confident in the earnings gains drivers will see that were making earnings guarantees in every city where were cutting prices.
