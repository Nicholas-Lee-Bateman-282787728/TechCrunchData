Classkick, an edtech startup out of Chicago,has raised $1.7 million to helpteachers narrow the achievement gap with its studentlearning app.The seed round came fromKapor Capital, Mitch and Freada Kapors social impact fund, Lightbank, Yammer founder Adam Pisoni, and Great Oaks Venture Capital.Kapor has backed a number of edtech startups working to level the playing field for children from low-income families, who now make up the majority of U.S. public school students.Classkicks co-founder, Andrew Rowland, understands the grind of teaching in a low-income school district better than most  Rowland taught high school math with Teach for America in Chicagos westside before he went back to school to study computer science.When I was in TFA there were no iPads, says Rowland, who would pick up the phone and call five parents every day after school to keep students families in the loop.A lack of parental involvement and general academic culture are two of the primary factors responsible for under achievement. Both of those things are really hard for an insanely overworked teacher in a low-income school to facilitate  but theyre both things that technology can help with tremendously, says Rowland.Teachers today can choose from a growing selectionof tech productsClassDojorewards students for positive behavior, Newsela tailors news-centric content to individualreading levels, and Edmodo provides a social network for teachers and students.With Classkick, studentscan getat home moreof the individualattention theyre lacking from their teachers during the school day. While their studentswork through problems on iPads, teachers can monitor the progress of the entire classsimultaneously using Classkicks teacher dashboard. Ratherthan looking for raised hands and walking from desk to desk, teachers are able to identify who is struggling in real time and provide quick suggestions via iPad.Granted, an abundance of iPads probably isnt the first thing youd expect to see in Americas poorestclassrooms. But this is changing.According to a recent survey by Project Tomorrow, one-third of U.S. students are using school-issued mobile devices. Half of all middle school students and 61% of high school students have access to tablets.Rowland says Classkicks long-term goal is to connect all the work a student does in the classroom with the stakeholders in their education  whether thats their teachers, parents, or peers  but for now, theyrefocusingon hiring more engineers and improving user experience.With users in 75 countries, all 50 U.S. states, and a 25% weekly growth rate since the apps fall 2014 launch, Classkick is off to a good start.
