The 9th Annual Crunchies are fast approaching, with the event best described as the Oscars of Startup and Technology taking place on February 8 at San Franciscos War Memorial Opera House. Some of your favorite startups, entrepreneurs and investors will be competing to win a coveted Crunchie award in one of 12 categories up for grabs. The Best Technology Achievement Crunchie goes to the products that reflect true excellence in their fields, products that made waves in the tech landscape in 2015. There are several great products up for the award this year, so lets take a look at this years finalists, as well as those companies that have won the award in previous years.Apples 3D TouchWith the launch of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, Apple fundamentally changed the way we interact with our iPhones with 3D touch. The iPhones screen now recognizes how much pressure you apply to your phone, and lets you essentially preview and act on things like emails, photos, addresses and more without ever leaving the app youre using. For example, when in Mail, you can lightly press and hold to preview an email, then either let go to return to your inbox or press a little harder to open it.Microsoft HoloLensIf theres one product that is ushering us into our Minority Report-like future, its Microsofts HoloLens, the companys holographic computing wearable headset. HoloLens users use gestures to interact with a 3D virtual world, letting them work and play in multiple dimensions. Basically, its a computer that you attach to your face that overlays images and objects in your living room.SpaceX Falcon 9Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX to transport satellites and the companys Dragon spacecraft into orbit. The Falcon 9s first stage rocket is designed to be reusable, and in December, the Falcon 9 achieved a huge milestone by successfully launching and landing the rocket on land for the first time.Tesla Over-The-Air AutopilotBack in October, Tesla rolled out an over-the-air update for the companys fleet that brought a desired new feature to the companys vehicles: autopilot. Teslas vehicles can now change lanes, keep a safe distance from other vehicles and maintain your speed. You can see our hands-on (or hands-off?) with Tesla auto-pilot here.
