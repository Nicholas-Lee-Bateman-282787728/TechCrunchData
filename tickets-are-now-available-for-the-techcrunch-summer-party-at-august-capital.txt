Case in point, when TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington used to hold these eventsin his Atherton back yard, Box founders Aaron Levie and Dylan Smith met one of their first investors, DFJ. And in 2010, we spotted 500 Startups Dave McClure writing a check to then-stealthy startup Tello, which was bought by Urban Airship.Hope to see you all there this year!Our sponsors help make TechCrunch events happen.
