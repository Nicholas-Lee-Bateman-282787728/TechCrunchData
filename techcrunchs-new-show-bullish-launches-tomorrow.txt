TechCrunch is launching a new show tomorrow called Bullish, hosted by your humble servant. The show will air every Wednesday at 10 a.m. Eastern.Bullish isnt quite likeour usual video fare at TechCrunch, so expect a differenttone than the one you enjoy on CribsandCrunchWeek.Each week well tackle a topic, interviewingsomeone with intimate knowledge of that space. Were going to try to stay away from asking people about their startups or portfolios; hearing people talk about their own game can be a dull riff. Instead, were going to bring in a motley crew from across Silicon Valleys diverse talent pool, and try to get under the skin of what is really driving technology today.The show, I can promise, is not an elaborate ruse to get me into makeup and a tie, although those are both effects of its existence. Im incredibly excited about Bullish, so lets have some fun, tell some jokes, and call bullshit when its warranted.See you all tomorrow morning.
