Former HP CEO Carly Fiornia announced earlier today that she would be running for president  but it appears someone else has already picked up one of the domains for her name and is pretty upset with her.While Fiorinas public campaign website is carlyforpresident.com, someone picked up the carlyfiorina.org domain and posted a page of 30,000 sad faces for all the people she laid off at HP. (Carlyfiorina.com still redirects to carlyforpresident.com.)Thats 30,000 people she laid off. People with families. And what does she say she would have done differently?Fiorina  whowill be joining us onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt NY on Tuesday  led HP through one of its most tumultuoustimes in the middle of the dot-com bust. Her campaign site touts her experience at HP, which, to be sure, was a challenging time for any technology company.Still, its quite a stunt and a reminder to follow Taylor Swifts lead when it comes to buying domain names.
