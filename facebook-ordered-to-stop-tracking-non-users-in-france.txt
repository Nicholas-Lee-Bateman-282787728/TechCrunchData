Yet more privacy problems for Facebook in Europe. Now the French data protection authority, the CNIL, has issued the company with a formal notice toget its house in order and comply with Europeandata protection law or face possible referral to the CNILs select committee which could then choose to pursue a sanction against the company.Facebook has been given three months to make the changes deemed necessary by the CNIL. If it does so to the DPAs satisfaction it willnot face any sanctions, the DPAsaid yesterday.TechCrunch understands Facebook is in the process of reviewing the order from the CNIL.A spokesperson provided the following statement regarding the action:We are confident that we comply with European Data Protection law and look forward to engaging with the CNIL to respond to their concerns.Those concerns are multiple, and were unearthed by an investigation triggered after Facebook amended its privacy policy in fall 2014. Specifically, the CNIL is unhappy that Facebook collects the browsing activityof Internet users who do not have a Facebook account.Indeed, the CNIL notice reads, the company does not inform Internet users that it sets a cookie on their terminal when they visit a Facebookpublic page (e.g. page of a public event or of a friend). This cookie transmits to Facebookinformation relating to third-party websites offering Facebookplug-ins (e.g. Like button) that are visited by Internet users.It also notes that Facebook collects user data concerning sexual orientation,religious and political views without the explicit consent of account holders. Nordoes itinform users on the sign up form with regard to their rights and the processing of their personal data.Advertising cookies are also set by Facebook without properly informing and obtaining the consent of Internet users, the CNIL asserts, noting that users are not offered any tools to prevent thecompilation of info fortargeted advertisingwhich it saysthereby violates their fundamental rights and interests, including their right to respect for private life.Perhaps most surprisingly, Facebook also stands accused of continuing to usethe now illegal Safe Harbor data transfer mechanism, which was invalidated by the European Court of Justice last October so a full four months ago.And although Europe and the US have apparently agreed a new deal (called the EU-US Privacy Shield), this has yet to come into force, so cannot yet be relied up on by companies wanting to legalize data transfers across the Atlantic. And,last weekthe head of the CNIL, who also heads up the WP29 group of European DPAs, reiterated that Safe Harbor is not an option  stressing that companies continuing to use the invalidated frameworkare in an illegal situation and could face sanctions from DPAs.Alternative data transfer methods were detailed by the European Commission last fall, after the Safe Harbor strikedown, so its rather surprising that Facebook has apparently not switched to using one of these alternatives to govern its Europe to US data transfers. Weve asked Facebook about this point and will update this story with any response.Update:Facebook claims it is not in fact using Safe Harbor to transfer data  pointing to prior comments it made last year, in which it said: Facebook, like many thousands of European companies, relies on a number of the methods prescribed by EU law to legally transfer data to the US from Europe, aside from Safe Harbor.Update 2: However a CNIL spokeswoman has pointed out that Facebook Francesprivacy policy page still includes the following paragraph noting its use of Safe Harbor OopsThe CNIL goes on to addthat it has made its formal notice against Facebook public due to the seriousness of the violations and the number of individuals concerned by the Facebookservice  noting the site has more than30 million users in France.Itsaction follows a lawsuit brought against Facebook by the Belgian data protection authority last summer, which was also concernedwithhow it tracksnon-users. The Belgian legal action led to the threat of daily fines for Facebookif it did not amend the operation of its tracking cookies  which it subsequently did, switching to requiring users to log in to view pages on the site.As well as investigations by the French and Belgian DPAs, Facebook is also being probedby Spanish, Dutch and German (Hamburg) data protection authorities. This working group of five DPAs was set up in March 2015 explicitly to investigate its new privacy policy.The CNIL notes that investigations by all the respective DPAs areongoing at the national level and within an international administrative cooperation framework. So Facebooks problems in Europe associated with its amended privacy policy look to befar from over.The new EU-US Privacy Shield is also at least two months out from being approved by the WP29, so theres no quick fix for companies needing to legalize transatlanticdata transfers (although there are a range of alternative mechanisms that can be used, such as standard contractual clauses and model contracts).
