Its not a convertedindustrial warehouse in Brooklyn. Or a stately, century-old building in the Flatiron.But YC-backed Regaliis atypical office locationup in the Dominican-heavy Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan has given it plenty of insights into itsworking-class immigrant customer base.The startup, co-founded by several Latinofounders who personally knew the hassles of sending money home, focuses on remittances.We camped out inWashington Heights, did deep customer research and we were surprised to see thatpeople didnt want to just send money to the Dominican Republic, said CTO Naysawn Naderi. They wanted to pay bills directly.The whole thing really confused us at first.So the company put together several deals with utility and other service providersin the Dominican Republicto let customers directly pay their families bills. That has brought them to more than $1 million in net revenues annually through their fees and cuts on exchange rates. Theyve also expanded to about 10 countries mostly in Latin America, with the largest market inMexico.Theyre calling this space productized remittances, because its not just about pure cash transfers. It requires a complex network of business partnerships and technology that enables providers in other countries to handle online payments better and faster.Regalii has become a platform with an API that handles bill amounts and ratesfor third-party merchants that want to partner with the company. Money transfercompaniescan track their customers bills, send reminders and facilitate direct payments instantly.Rather than sending money, you can actually pay for something. People just wanted this peace of mind that theycould take care of their mothers directly. In thedeveloping world, utility providers tend to be prettyquickabout cutting offelectricity if youre not on-time, Naderi said, adding that about 20 percent of the global $435 billion remittances market seems to be in bill and utilitypayments.The company has raised $3 million to date from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Winklevoss Capital, YC partners Alexis Ohanian, Garry TanandKapor Capital.
