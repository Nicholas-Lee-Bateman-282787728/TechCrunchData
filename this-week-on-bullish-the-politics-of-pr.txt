Welcome back to Bullish, where we try to explore that fine line between what is bullish, and what is bullshit.This time around we have Amy Widdowson Mains in the studio to dig into public relations (PR), and the politics of the matter. Happily, Mains works in policy PR that is technology facing, making her the perfect person to chat to about the larger issues at hand.Simply put, I want to know how PR professionals  and there are quite a lot of them  manage to represent and promote their clients, even when they mightnot particularly like a companys product, or, perhaps, agree with its politics.(I feel obliged here to point out that I have no beefwith any of Mains clients.)Bullish airs every Wednesday at 7 am Pacific, and 10 am Eastern. Lets go.
