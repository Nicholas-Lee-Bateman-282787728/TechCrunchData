DJI, 3DR, Parrot and GoPro are launching their own drone advocacy group to lobby for policies that promote innovation and safety, and create a practical and responsible regulatory framework.The Small UAV Coalition, which launched with participation from DJI, 3DR, Amazon Prime Air and others interested in the drone ecosystem, has beenone of the main lobbyinggroups for drone manufacturers since it launched in 2014.Now, however, the logos ofDJI, 3DR, Parrot and GoProare nowhereto be found on the Small UAV Coalitions member page(which still includes the likes of Google[x], Amazon Prime Air, AirMap, Intel and others).There are significant economic and social benefits to drone operations in the U.S., and industry must work with policymakers to ensure a safe environment for flying, the members of the new alliance said in a statement today. The Drone Manufacturers Alliance believes a carefully balanced regulatory framework requires input from all stakeholders and must recognize the value and necessity of continued technological innovation. By highlighting innovation and emphasizing education, we intend to work with policymakers to ensure drones continue to be safely integrated into the national airspace.As the drone market and the number of companies in it  continued to grow, theSmall UAV coalition probably didnt feel like the right kind of group to represent the interests of these major drone manufacturers anymore.As long as this doesnt lead to unnecessary turf wars, having two organizations that essentially advocate for the same issues doesnt have to be a bad thing, especially if the Small UAV coalition now gets to focus on commercial drone usage and the Drone Manufacturer Coalition on consumer issues.
