Though there has been quite a bit said about the forthcoming Apple TV 4, price is still a yet-to-be-determined factor. But 9to5Macs Mark Gurman has sources who say the new box, reportedly powered by an A8 chip, will retail for under $200 (either $149 or $199).The Apple TV is set to be unveiled alongside the next-gen iPhones at a September 9 event, according to sources. TechCrunchs own Matthew Panzarino laid out a detailed piece on what to expect from the new device, including a full platform for games and app content, an SDK from which developers can build, and a brand new remote.Perhaps the most interesting hardware development, the remote will reportedly pack a number of motion sensors, a touchscreen, as well as a microphone for Siri-style integration.On the software side, Apple also has plans to build out a cable-replacing content platform that lets users watch television and movies on-demand, which sources say will cost $40/month. At the time of debut, however, users will still need to log in with their cable providers to access that content.Gurman also reported that the Apple TV 4 will begin to ship in October after its unveiling in September.
