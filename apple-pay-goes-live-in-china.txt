Apple Pay has today launched in China, a move that takes Apples digital payments service into its fifth country worldwide.The service had been tipped to go live in China since December  further hints were droppedthis week  and now Apple has delivered in the country, which is its second largest market behind only the U.S. based on revenue.Apple Pay initially supports credit and debit cards fromUnionPay, which counts 260 million users. UnionPay isnt just relying on Apple though, it secured a similar partnership with Samsung last year and also already offers its QuickPass contactless payment technology, which it plans to expand to coveralternative technology such aswearables.Apple Pay has been one of the pioneers of mobile payments in the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia  the four other countries were it is operational  but it is playing catchup in China, where it mustcompete with serviceslikeAlibabas Alipay, which has over 400 million registered users, and Tencents WePay, which is available through blockbuster Chinese messaging app WeChat.Both are already widely used for online, offline and mobile-based purchases. Interestingly, Tim Cook is reported to havemet with Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma last year to discuss integrating Apple Pay with Alipay. A deal didnt materialize, however.Taking a significant slice of this competitive market will not be easy, but Apple is confident that it can make an impression.We think China could be our largest Apple Pay market, Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, told Reutersin an interview.Its been a busy 24 hours for Apple. Aside from launching Apple Pay in China, the company has hit back at the government for trying to create a backdoor into the iPhone. Disrupting payments in the worlds largest country and fighting the U.S. government  just a regular day then.
