If you havent tried Peach out because you dont have an iOS device, a developer has ginned up something called Nectarine, which is an unofficial Android and web version of the service.Its limited as far as what you can do and how you can interact, but you can definitely view your stream (in flipped order), like posts and comment on posts. Its pretty handy if youre still using the serviceya know, since some folks are already calling it dead.Ive found the service to be pretty sticky, with its command-line interface or Magic Words an intriguing approach to social messaging.Peachs creator, Dom Hoffman, jumped into Product Hunt to give it the cool nod, so thats good. Maybe theres potential for some fun creations to be made for the service down the road from third party developers. The official Android app is being worked on, the Peach team has said, but this will get you your non-iOS fix for now.(feed GIF via Ryan Hoover)
