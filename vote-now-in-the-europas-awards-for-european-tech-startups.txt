Voting in The Europas, the European Tech Startups Awards, has gone live. This is the final shortlist from which the winners will be chosen by a combination of industry votes and eminent judges. You can vote here. The awards are supported by TechCrunch, the official media partner.Held annually, The Europas are the main European Awards for technology startups. The whole thing comes together on a special awards night in London, on June 16, which is preceded by an invitation-only conference. You can grab tickets here. Attendees, nominees and winners will get deep discounts to TechCrunch Disrupt in London, later this year.Of course, out of the sheer need to filter the thousands of people in tech startups across Europe, the Awards cant cover every single startup, investor and entrepreneur. But its a selection of amongst the best Europe has to offer.Voting ends in 24 hrs, at midday CET, Tuesday May 19. So get voting!Its just another sign the European tech scene has never looked better.
