Its 2015 andyou might think ofthe mainframe as a vestige of an earlier computing era, but these megamachines still play a roleinside large institutions running intensive workloads.And as though to prove its ongoing utility, TheLinux Foundation announced it waslaunching the Open Mainframe Project today, an open source endeavordevoted to helping companies using mainframe computers.The newventure was driven in large part by IBM, a primarysupplier of these machines. In fact, its not a coincidence that itannounced a partnership with Canonical today to build a Linux mainframe running Ubuntu Linux.It may surprise you to learn Linux has been running on mainframes for 15 years, and asLinux usage has grown on mainframes, a community of users has built up. The project is a response to that growing demand,Jim Zemlin, executive director at the Linux Foundationexplained in a statement.The idea is that those companies participating in this project can work together, and beginbuilding a set of open source tools and technologies for Linux mainframes, while helpingone another overcome common development issues in the same manner asall open source projects.TheOpen Mainframe Project gives these customers, vendors and service providers one place to come together, Ross Mauri, general manager for IBM Systems explained.IBM is sweetening the pot by contributing 250,000 lines of mainframe code to the Linux community.Early members are companies that have a deep commitment to mainframe computing already, like IBM, BMC, CA Technologies and Marist College,Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT told TechCrunch.The companies involved, especially IBM, are hoping to drive more mainframe usage by loweringthe cost and complexity of owning one.The real question is how effective the group will be in attracting members whose interest may be initially limited, King said.Ultimately the mainframe mainstaysare hoping toattract a new generation of developers to their platform. To help coax new users,IBM will be offering free access to the LinuxOne cloud, a mainframe simulation tool it developed for creating, testing and piloting Linux mainframe applications. It also allows developers to test how well their applicationswork with linked resources such as mobile applications and hybrid cloud applications.Its hard to say how this will all play out, but King says in a best-case scenario, the real benefitcould be luring new Linux developers to this older-style computing platform.Whether this attempt to build an open source community expands mainframe interestand usage remains to be seen, but the charter membersare certainly keeping their fingers crossed.
