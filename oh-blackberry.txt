BlackBerry has gone back to making touchscreen phones again after it unveiled the Leap, adevice thatthe company believes will appeal to young people and startup founders, in particular.The troubled Canadian firm returnedto its roots when it launched a Qwerty devicein December, but this time the keyboard is gone  the Leap looks like something that the company would have released a coupleof years ago  at least in terms of the aesthetics  and we all know how it fared then.The basics: the Leap has a five-inch HD screen, with an eight-megapixel rearcamera and 16GB of on-device storage. The company touted the phones battery life, which it claimed will last for a day. It also pushedBBM as a productivity tool, its Siri-like personal assistant and, of course, its security creds.BlackBerry believes  seemingly with genuine sincerity  that the Leap will appeal to young peoplewho want to get things done. It actually thinks startups will go for the Leap.BlackBerry Leap was built specifically for mobile professionals who see their smartphone device as a powerful and durable productivity tool that also safeguards sensitive communications at all times, said BlackBerrysRon Louksin a canned statement.Unfortunately, at this point, most people will disagree. Software and services have gone cross-platform, even BBM  once the companys prized asset and messaging app trend-setter  has been usurped by countless rivals; both enterprise- and consumer-focused. Really, theres nothing unique about BlackBerry today, unless you happen to be one of the Canadian firms ardent fans.TechCrunchs ownJohn Biggs took a shine to last years BlackBerry Classic, but ultimately said that he wouldnt give up a Samsung Galaxy S or iPhone for it. And therein lies the problem that the Leap doesnt appear to solve.BlackBerry did say that it is planning to release a phone with curved edges  like the Galaxy S6 Edge  but even then, youd have to wonder if the company still has what it takes to appeal beyond its existing fanbase.Anyway, heres BlackBerrypitching the Leap to go-getting, young startup hustlers
