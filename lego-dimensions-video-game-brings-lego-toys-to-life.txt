Lego has a new game in the works with Warner Bros. Interactive, which brings the building blocks into the toys-to-life category to compete with the likes of Skylanders. The new Lego Dimensions game is set for a September 27 release date, and will incorporate a number of popular and familiar properties, including DC Comics, The Lord of the Rings, Back to the Future and The Lego Movie to name just a few.The title will be available on pretty much every home console, spanning Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Wii U, and is being developed by Travelers Tales, the studio behind the extremely popular existing line of Lego video games. The unique twist here is that the starter pack ships with a Lego Toy Pad, which works with custom Lego mini figures, bricks and sets to generate in-game content.The toys-to-life category has exploded thanks to the success of things like Activisions Skylanders series, as well as the Disney Infinity line. Lego is arguably a perfect fit to join the fray, since its line of toys is already extremely popular, as are the video games based on the toys, which mimic in-game the real life properties of the building blocks and mix-and-match mini figures.Included in the starter pack are the Toy Pad, some bricks, three miniatures including Batman, Gandalf and Wyldstyle from the Lego Movie, as well as a Lego Batmobile. More properties will be included in the Dimension world over time, Lego says in a press release.
