Project Fi, which is Googles way of jumping in the middle of the great carrier race, has shared today that starting tomorrow, you can order a SIM for your data-only device. Ive switched one of my phones over to Fi and I really havent had a problem with finding reception and the way they bill you is refreshing.Heres what the Google Fi team said today about the data-only initiative:With this update, you can access cellular connection from tablets and other connected devices while on the go. Once youve ordered and received a data-only SIM, just pop it into a compatible device, follow the instructions, and voila: instant wireless connectivity. Just like with our phone plans, youre charged a flat $10/GB for data and pay only for what you use. You can cancel at any time.If youre already a Project Fi customer, you can add another SIM for your iPad, Nexus 7 and Nexus 9, or other data-only tablet or device. If youre not a customer yet, you have to sign up for an invite.Of course, youll want to first confirmwhether youre in Fis coverage area.Subscribers have been getting LEGO sets as a holiday gift, so its nice to see that Google is making the customer service for carriers space better. I cringe if I have to get on the line with AT&T.
