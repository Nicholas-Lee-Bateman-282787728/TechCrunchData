Europes refugee crisis has spilled over to Facebook. In Germany, where thousands ofSyrian refugees fleeing conflict in their own country are being offered asylum, Facebook has found itself being pressuredby thegovernment todo more to combat hate speech against immigrants.Yesterday the WSJ reported thatFacebook has agreed to workwith the German Justice Ministry to fight xenophobic and racist messages being posted on its platform.In a statement, Facebook also saidit is striving topartner with Germany internet safety NGO, FSM, to help support users in Germany, as well asworking with expert local input to do more to tackle hate speech. For its part, the FSM said it welcomes Facebooks efforts to become a member, with general manager Otto Vollmers adding: Along with Facebook, we can develop joint solutions to address controversial cases referred to in this sensitive and difficult trade-off.The move to partner with a relevant local organization to combat hate speech is in addition to existing resources focused onthe German market within Facebookscommunity operations team, which the company reiteratedalready includes German language specialists that review German content.Facebook also noted that its existingcommunity standards prohibit hate speech against protected groups and the incitement to violence against others. However in recent weeks, as the WSJnotes, the German government has criticized Facebook for not being fast or comprehensive enough in removing hate speech from its platform. Hence the government nowco-ordinating the creation of a task force  that will involve Facebook and other Internet competitors  aimedat evaluating whether content flagged as inappropriate should be consideredacceptablefreedom of speech. Or whether its actually illegal hate speech under German law.Commenting on this ina statement, Facebooks head of policy in Germany, Eva-Maria Kirschsieper, said: We are looking forward to our meeting with Federal Minister of Justice Heiko Maas as we believe that the best solutions are often found when people in business, politics and civil society all work together on common challenges like online safety.In parallelFacebook said it would be setting up its own task force, inviting local community organizations to be involved in finding solutions towhat it said is a complex issue. It addedthat only a very small minority of people have posted content that appears to cross the line of acceptable speech  noting also theres been plenty of positive sentiment expressed about refugees via Facebook  and emphasizedthat it welcomes political debate on our platform, adding it believes it is especially important to allow this to happen when issues are controversial.Its fair to say that big U.S. tech platformshave increasingly found their First Amendment free speech positions are required to flex as they expand intoother markets  whether its to comply withregional legal differencesor because their profile means theycome under acute political pressure on sensitive local issues, such as the current refugee crisis in Europe, or indeed on issues such asterrorism. The Internet does not have (many)boundariesyet crosses many international borders, so the biggerthetech giant, the more their operationalpoliciesneeds must contain multitudes.Working with local community organizations in Germany is one way for Facebook to be seen to besensitive to local realities  in a bid to steer off further criticism from the government  while also spreading some of the burden of adapting its operations for different markets. Convening a mixed group to tackle a speech-basedissue also likely allows Facebook to speak up for the pro-speech position, given that theGermangroupswill beproviding more expert input on whats inappropriate speech under local laws and within localcommunities.Facebook believes that the best way to address complex issues like hate speech on the Internet is for companies, NGOs and politicians to work together sharing their expertise in different aspects of the problem, it said. The aim of this group is to find workable solutions to counter xenophobia and racism and the way in which this may be expressed online. Facebook will be inviting community organisations such as Netz Gegen Nazis, Laut gegen Nazis, and FSM to join the group as well as representatives of political parties in Germany, and of other online services. We are also inviting the German Ministry of Justice to participate in that dialogue.In a third push also clearly aimed at moving the debateonto ground Facebook is more comfortable with, itsaid it will be working to promote counterspeech as an anti-hate speech strategy offering interested organizationsbest practice examples from all over the world on how to effectively use counterspeech. So, basically, getting people to post more to Facebook as a strategy to counter problematic content thatrisksbeing taken off Facebook. Which of course makes sensefor a business powered byuser generated content.Facebook will bring key experts from Great Britain and the Nordics  countries that already today have great expertise on counter speech  to support organisations in Germany to even better use the platform for their initiatives and to enable them to fight against racism and xenophobia with the most possible impact, it added.The argument that bad speech should be countered with more speech is one thats often deployed in defense of absolutist free speech positions (which view any takedowns as censorship). Howeverwhere hate speech is concerned, the law provides some hard limits.
