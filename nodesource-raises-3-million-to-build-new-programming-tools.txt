NodeSource, a corporate software development toolkit for the node.js programming language, has raised $3 million in seed financing.Money for the round came from Crosslink Capital and Resolute Ventures and its yet another sign that distributed architectures are becomingde rigueur for businesses.Theres a lot of money in the toolkit banana stand, with big data applications all the rage and folks like Cloudera and others raising well over a billion dollars for Hadoop-based toolkits.NodeSources products also speak to the same need to develop ways for programmers to take advantage of scalable, service-oriented architectures.JavaScript is no longer limited to just websites. It is now running on the server thanks to the massive adoption of Node.js, saidBrendan Eich, who invented theJavaScript programming language and serves as an adviser to NodeSource.The company already has a roster of clients like Uber, PayPal, Fitbit and Netflix.According to a statement, NodeSource will use the money to release new products and support its partnerships with undisclosed Fortune 500 companies.In terms of knowledge transfer, NodeSource has the magic to keep Node.js pure and reliable, while future-proofing it for new architectural approaches, said Eric Chin, General Partner at Crosslink Capitalin a statement.As a result of the financing, Chin will join NodeSource on the board of directors.Monolithic applications, mainly written in Java, are killing development cycles, stifling innovation and keeping Java-heavy IT organizations many steps behind their competitors, especially those who have embraced a microservices architecture, saidNodeSource Co-Founder and CEO, Joe McCann, in a statement.
