Twitters acquisition of India-based mobile marketing startup ZipDialis not only a smart move to boost monetization of its internationaluser base, but it highlights that there areinnovative tech companies hiding in plain sight in emerging markets.ZipDial began in response to the phenomenon of missed calls, which developed intoan alert system of their own in India. With many phone owners on pre-pay tariffs and keen to avoid charges formobile data or SMS/calling,drop-calling a friend when you get home from an evening out, for example, becamea way to let them know you arrived safely without incurring costs.ZipDial smartly tapped into that opportunityto give advertisers a convenient medium to reach consumers on any kind of mobile phone. That samemodel worked well for advertisers on Twitter and also Facebook, both of which had partnered with the Indian company. (Rumor has it Facebook was also bidding to buy it.)What is most interesting about ZipDial is that its product is unique, it could only have been thought upin an emerging market. In that way it is not wholly dissimilar to WhatsApp  the red-hot messaging app thatwas unknown to many in Silicon Valley untilFacebook bought it last year, despite having hundreds of millions of active users across the world. (Yes, WhatsApp was founded in the U.S. but CEO Jan Koum is not American and has a different mindset to the Silicon Valley Set.)Twitter has paid much less than the $17 billion that Facebook forked out for WhatsApp  our sources suggest ZipDial may have been sold for $40-$50 million  butthedeal highlights that emerging markets cant be whollydependent onSilicon Valley, even though it isthe global home of startupsthathas birthedhuge tech firms.Theincreased internationalization of the world  ZipDial co-founder and CEO Valerie Wagoneris a U.S. expat  combinedwith a risein developer talent overseas (thanks toincreased access to informationonline) and the growth of VCs investing overseas,means mostof theingredients that drive Silicon Valley can be found all over the world.When you consider that top programmers and thinkers are in emerging markets, with VC firms like 500 Startups (a ZipDial investor) providing money and knowhow,it stands to reason that this is just the beginningfor emerging marketinnovation.As for ZipDial and Twitter: the deal could turn out to be a relative bargain for the U.S. company. ZipDial had already begun its expansion to Southeast Asia, and the company has hinted that it has newproducts and services coming soon.India is a vast market for social networks  Facebook has over 100 million active users there, for example  but it could be that the ZipDial platform is introduced in other parts of the world, such as Africa and Latin America. Regardless of whether it takes off in any of those places, $50 million is a shrewdinvestment to grow Twitters visibility in India and get an engineering office in the country.
