The nations second largest health insurer, Anthem,alerted its customers on Wednesday that hackers had stolen the personal information of likely tens of millions of customers.Personal information including addresses, birthdays, medical identification numbers, social security numbers and some income data belonging to both current and former customers were swept up in the cyber attack, according toa statement from Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish. In somewhatof a silver lining, at this time the company does not believe the hackers stole any medical information or payment information.He wrotethe company is notifying members individually if their information was accessed.Anthems own associates personal information  including my own  was accessed during this security breach, he wrote. We join you in your concern and frustration, and I assure you that we are working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data.Swedish wrotethe insurer has notified the FBI and has fully cooperated with their investigation. He added the company has also brought on cybersecurity firm Mandiant, the firm that exposed ongoing cyber attacks from the Peoples Libertarian Army in 2013.Despite these efforts, the company has not yet identifiedthe attacker.USA TODAY reports the attack could impact up to 80 million Anthem customers, double the number of payment cards affected by the breach of Target last year.Although this announcement feels all too familiar following thestring of recent hacks on companies ranging from Sony to JP Morgan, the Wall Street Journal notes this breachdiffers from others because Anthem discovered the breach itself and quickly notified the public. Hopefully for consumers, this marks a shift in how companies will approach similar hacks in the future.The hack affected a wide array of Anthem brands, includingAnthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup, Caremore, Unicare, Healthlink, and DeCare.The company has set up a websiteand a toll-free number (1-877-263-7995) for customers to access updates and ask questions related to the hack. The company will also provide a credit monitoringand identity protection service free of charge.
