The Commander and Chief has just made his music streaming service allegiancesknown. The White House released a pair of playlists Friday morning that were allegedly hand-picked by Obama himself.Were they on Apple Music?Nah.How about Tidal?Forget about it.Two iterations of The Presidents Summer Playlist were released, with both Day and Night varieties made available on Spotify..@POTUS Welcome to Spotify, Mr. President The duo of presidential playlists drop as President Obama is halfway through a relaxing vacationinMarthas Vineyard. The White House Comms team probably released the very chill (it has a Florence + The Machines track), very safe (no Die Antwoord songs here) Obama playlists to give the American peoplearelatable moment with President Obama as he takes a breather at a very un-relatable$12 million Marthas Vineyard estate.The playlists themselves arediverse in their lazy summer tune selections, thoughI will sayI have a hard time believing that the leader of the free world spends his quiet moments listening to The Lumineers or Justin Timberlakes Pusher Love Girl, but the playlists are pretty strong otherwise with jams fromJoni Mitchell, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and John Coltrane.Obama may not have postedthe tracks out on Tidal, but he did include a Beyonce track on the list,so maybe him and Jay Z will be all good, butmy real question is: what will Neil Young think about this slight?Poor PonoMusic.
