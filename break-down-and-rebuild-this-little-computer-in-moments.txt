During a 40 minute trawl through the CES floors with TechCrunchsFrederic Lardinois, we ran into Xi3, a company that makes small, modular computers. It turns out you can fit a full PC into pretty much any size, or shape box. Meet the X7A!We forgot to ask about the decor, but the company seems to be building some pretty cool stuff.Spoiler: I have to assemble a computer on camera. And Frederic makes fun of me.Image: Xi3
