There are few traditional businesses that investor Chamath Palihapitiya isnt interested in disrupting.At a StrictlyVC event in September, he talked about raising a multibillion real estate fund to co-manage besidethe $600 million that his already unconventional venture firm, Social + Capital Partnership, closed on earlier this year.Today, at the Mobile First Summitin San Francisco, Palihapitiya planted the seeds for yet another ambitious and expensive project. According to Business Insider, Palihapitiya is hoping to raise between $4 billion and $10 billion dollars to take on AT&T and Verizon with a new company called Rama.Apparently, the year-old company has already been quietly licensing spectrum in Sri Lanka, where Palihapitiya was born (though his family emigrated to Canada when he was 6 years old). Its now reportedly in talks to buy spectrum in the Philippines and, perhaps more significantly, has its sights set on an FCC spectrum auction this spring.Palihapitiya acknowledges that not only does he have to raise the money first  hesuggests to BI that some well-known investors are already on board with his plans  but hell have to win the spectrum, too, which mightnot be easy.The FCC is planning to auction the low-frequency spectrum  which is capable of carrying a signal further than higher-frequency bands  next spring. But Ramawont just be competing against Verizon and AT&T, which already control about three-quarters of the countrys low-band spectrum. It will also be going up against other small carriers for a portion of the spectrum that will be set aside for them to bid on.That could include small rural carriers.
