Late last night, we pointed out that Google had started quietly rolling out an iPad-friendly build of Inbox (the companys invite-only Gmail reader with built-in tricks like email snoozing) in select countries. We noted that Google would probably make it official and ship it worldwide within a few hours.Sure enough, Google has just made the announcement.Inbox is now officially available for iPad, as well as Android tablets.Meanwhile, its finally picked up official support for Firefox and Safari, whereas only Chrome had been supported to date*. You can find the web version here.(* Though you could totally spoof your browser agent to get it to work in other browsers, and it worked pretty darn well.)Alas, one caveat: its still invite-only. While its not hard to get in (if all else fails, email inbox@google.com and wait a few days), its still sort of roped off.
