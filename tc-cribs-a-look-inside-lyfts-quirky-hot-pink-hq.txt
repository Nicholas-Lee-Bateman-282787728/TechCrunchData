We enter the land of ride-sharing startup Lyft on this weeks episode of Cribs. Lyfts San Francisco headquarters are a bit like entering Willy Wonkas factory  if it werepainted head-to-toe in hot pink. Large mop-like displays in Lyfts signature hue greet visitors to the66,000 square-foot space on the edge of San Franciscos Mission district. Fuzzy pillows, mustaches, hot pink walls and pop-culture characters run chockablock throughout each floor.Lyfts warehouse office was once the domain of the University of California, San Francisco. The ride-sharing service took over a few years back and brought in Rapt Studios to add a truly unique touch to every inch of the office  including elevators that look as though Cookie Monsters pink cousin exploded inside.Lyfts funky and imaginative space strives to connect the creative branding with a growing population of workers. Employees have room to meet up and exchange ideas in open areas and in specially made enclosures, too.Check out the secret room (full of mustachioed men) and other fun work perks in the video above for an inside look to this unique startup space.
