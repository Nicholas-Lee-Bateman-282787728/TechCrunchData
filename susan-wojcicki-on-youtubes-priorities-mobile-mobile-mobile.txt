Susan Wojcicki, top banana at YouTube, took the stage at Fortunes Brainstorm Tech conference just a few minutes ago to talk about the future of Googlesvideo unitand answer some questions about competitors, including Facebook and Twitter.As for what to expect, Wojcicki said that 50 percent of YouTubes views are now coming from mobile devices, and that as a result, the companys top three priorites are mobile, mobile, mobile.She also suggested that an acquisition could be in YouTubes future if the right company crosses YouTubes path. If theres a company that lets us our [fulfill our] strategy faster, then yes, anything that helps us move faster is game, she told interviewer Adam Lashinsky.Wojcicki also said to expect a public rollout later this year of Music Key, a music service that YouTube launched in beta late last year and whose key features include enablingusers tolisten ad free, touse the serviceoffline, and to use it in the background (i.e, while browsing through their other apps).She wasnt asked, and didnt volunteer, whether the service would cost $10 a month as was originally the plan. Thats the same price, of course, that numerous other streaming music services charge customers who arent willing to sitthrough ads. She did stress that Music Key differentiates itself in numerous ways, including via the related music videos it can share with users,not to mention all the user-generated clips of people whovecovered songs. Our corpus is very different, she offered.Wojcicki declined to provide hard numbers about YouTubesgrowth, despite outsiders longstanding fascination with the service. For example, asked about the accuracy of reported numbers that YouTube saw $4 billion in profit in 2014 but zero profits, Wojcicki said she wished she could talk about YouTubesfinancials as it would make my life easier. She then offered only that Youtube is seeing really good growth of our partner revenue.Not last, Wojcicki was asked if YouTube gets exclusivity with [its many video] stars, and do you want it? (YouTube has offered its creators exclusive multi-year agreements in the past.) She didnt answer the first part of the question directly, but said that while exclusive agreements with its top talentwould be nice, I dont think its necessary. YouTube is their home. Its where they were born.Their fans, she said, expect to see them there, she added.
