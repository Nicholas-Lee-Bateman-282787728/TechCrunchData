T-Mobile, specifically itseccentric CEO John Legere,announced a couple pretty major initiativeswith Apple today that, amongst other things, featurefree Apple Music streaming and an upgraded iPhone trade-in plan.Music Freedom, a pretty sweet #Uncarrier initiative from T-Mobile, makes sure that streamed tunes from various music apps dont eat into your allotted data. Today, T-Mobile announced that it would be adding Apple Music streaming to the service as well. Legere specified that as of now, the services covered by Music Freedom accounted for 95% of music streamed in the United States.Legere also announced an update to its JUMP! On Demand iPhone trade-in program. Customers have been able torent a new iPhone on the service for $15 a month and when a new model of the iPhone (or any other phone) came out, they couldtrade-in their old phone and upgrade to the new model. The company already has one of the better deals of the big telecoms, but today they announced that customers who bought an iPhone 6 this summer, couldlock-in the $15 rate for the next iPhone when it comes out, given that they customers trade in a working phone at the time of purchase.A littleconfusing, but not a bad deal, especially when considering that similar deals from other phone companies all hover around $20 a month for the same promotion.On a side note, god love John Legere. The bombastic T-Mobile CEO may be annoying as all hell, but he never fails to entertain.T-Mobile actually had some major news with Apple today, andhe chose to preface it witha patented tirade against those greedy bastards, AT&T and Verizon.
