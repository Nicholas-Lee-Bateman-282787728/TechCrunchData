While there are a number of mobile apps that serve as a panic button of sorts  alerting friends or family when you feel youre in danger  last years TechCrunch Disrupt NY hackathon winner Witness resonated with the events audience because it also promised a way to discreetly record incidents of civil disobedience and police brutality at a time when high-profile clashes with police were making headlines.Today,that app, now called Parachute, is rolling out its first significant update since its 2015 launch. In additionto an expanded feature set, the app also allows organizations to connect with Parachute in order to receivelive incidents recorded and shared by end users.The way Witness originally worked was by allowing users to launch the app and immediately start live-streaming from their phone. This video stream was geolocated and immediately shared with those on the users emergency contact list, who were alerted to the incoming video by way of an automated phone call, email and text message.Plus, when a cell signal wasnot present, the app would storethe footage on the device then send it out when a signal again becameavailable. Once on Parachutes servers, the data on the phone is wiped.Another notable feature was that the app would black out the screen to allow users to record discreetly  something that could help them in the event of an emergency, an abuse scenario, or when documenting evidence of police brutality, human rights violations, or even just a news event where recording was prohibited.Because Witness handles sensitive data, it doesnt look at the incidents recorded unless users request it. But the company says that in some cases, users asked for footage to give to police or lawyers.But users werent the only ones interested inaccessingrecordings, as it turns out.FounderMarinos Bernitsas, who left the world ofalgorithmic trading in New York to focus on building apps, says that since Witnesss App Store launch in July, more than 50 organizations reached out asking if there was a way to receive live Witness incidents from users, and archive that recorded footage for further analysis.This is now what the Parachute platform aims to deliver.Organizations can choose toaccess live-streamed incidents and archive the footage via a web-based control center, or they can useParachutes APIs to access this functionality programmatically. This allows them to integrate Parachutes capabilities into their own applications, if they choose. The ability to integrate Parachute into third-party devices is also now in beta testing.Included in the platform is a live view of active incidents, which resembles a CCTV monitor showing video, audio and location.Organizations canalso search their incidents archive, accessincident-level analytics like speed and distance traveled, and reconstruct events using composites to piece together multiple incidents.Early testers of the platform include organizations in the safety, healthcare, insurance, news, transportation, and human rights space, notesBernitsas.In order to receive these incidents, however, users have to opt to add the organization to their list of emergency contacts by clicking an Add us on Parachute link.This sets up a virtual hotline of sorts which not only alerts the organization by way of emails, calls or texts, but also lets them route the incident to dispatch systems, TVs, social media, and more.Beyond the launch of the platform, the updated Parachute app today introduces a number of new features and enhancements as well. It nowblacks out the screen for discreet recording, but allows you to press on an eye button to check on the recording, if need be.It also identifies altitude (like the floor of the building youre on) using sensors, includes a better streaming algorithm for low-bandwidth situations, allows you to delete incidents after 24 hours via a link to your email, and includesan iOS widget.This widget lets you more quickly activate a recording, as all you need to do is press and hold the widget for one second.Bernitsas tells us that he had been focused on scaling the infrastructure and keeping up with demand, but now that Parachute is live, hes looking to make growing the team the number one priority.Weve only scratched the surface of what technology can do to make the world a safer place, writes Bernitsas in a post introducing the new features and branding. As we head on to our second year, we will keep pushing the boundaries of technology towards our mission to provide the simplest, fastest and most reliable experience in the event of an emergency, he says.
