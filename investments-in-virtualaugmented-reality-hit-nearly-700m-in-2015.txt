The virtual fire continues to heat up beneath the AR/VR industry with investments continuing to build and soar.According to a report from Digi-Capital, AR and VR investments are taking off pretty rapidly with nearly $700 million being invested into the space in 2015.The report also detailed that 2015 saw just $311 million ofAR/VR M&A exits, which it noted wasnt all that surprising given how relatively early it is in the industryslife cycle. The report stressed that there would likely besignificant movement soon in the industry as major players try to leapfrog the competitionAnother item thats clear from the report is the fact that secretive powerhouse Magic Leap is animpressively hulking force in the industry. Their $542M Series B led by Google in October of 2014 presents a pretty clear kink in the generally nice upward trend of yearly investments.The report also obviously doesnt include Magic Leaps(still unconfirmed) 2015 raise, which Forbes reportedclocked in at a staggering and industry-dwarfing $827 million.The report has a pretty bullishoutlook on the future growth of VR/AR, suggesting that the next platform shift to AR/VR looks like it coulddrive growth to $120 billion by 2020. That is a hell of a lot of dough.
