Ant Financial, the Alibaba affiliate that manages hugely popular payments service Alipay, is raising a new round of financing that could value the company as high as $60 billion ahead of a much-speculated public listing.The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is in talks with investors to pull in20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) in fresh money. Ant Financial didnt provide comment on the report, but TechCrunch was able to verify from a source close to the deal that the firm is raising, and at avaluation of between $50 billion to $60 billion as the Journal first reported. Ant Financial closedits Series A last summer, while that deal was undisclosed it came at a valuation of $45-$50 billion.Ant Financial is best known for operating Alipay,Chinas top online payments service that counts 500 million users and 200 million credit cards. The firms other businesses includeSesame credit-scoring, Yue Bao money market fund, a micro-loan program and Alibabas online bank: MYBank.Ant Financial was controversially spun off from Alibaba in 2011, a move that drew heat from investor Yahoo but was purportedly done in responsetoChinese regulations around payments. Alibabas record-breaking $25 billion IPOin 2014 didnt include Ant Financial, which is expected to IPOin China next year.The two entities are separate, but they share a number of executives and investors whileAlibaba stands toprofit from a public listing thanks to its shareholding. The two have also joined forces in the past, through investments in Hong Kong-based lottery firmAGTech Holdings and Indias PayTM, a commerce and payments firm that very much resembles Alibaba and Ant Financial.Alipay isnt the only billion dollar financial to be set free from a e-commerce giant in China. Nasdaq-listed JD.coms financial services arm pulled in $1 billion in January led by Sequoia China. That round valuedJD Finance at around $7.1 billion. Baidu and Tencent,which also rival Alibaba across a range of areas, both run their own online banks and financing programs, but each (WeBank, Tencent, and Baixin Bank, Baidu) is a unit insidethe parent company.
