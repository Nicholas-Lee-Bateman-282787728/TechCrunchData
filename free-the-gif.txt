Yet another app has sprouted up that wants to take the Live Photos from your iPhone 6S/6S Plus and turn them into videos and/or GIFs. Because what is beauty  nay, what is art  without the ability to share it?Lively, an app from Tiny Whale, lets you turn your all-too-locked-up Live Photos into GIFs or videos with control speeds for the GIF, ranging from 0.5x to 2.0x.But lets backtrack, just in case you have no idea what I mean by Live Photos.With the launch of the newest iPhones, the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, Apple released a new software feature called Live Photos. When the feature is toggled on, the camera captures a couple of seconds both before and after the shutter button is pressed, and strings those frames together to form a GIF.Unfortunately, only the the latest Apple software supports Live Photos, which means you cant send the Live part of the photo to anyone outside of the Apple ecosystem.Lively looks to open that up a bit.Of course, Lively isnt the only one with this idea. Live GIF launched earlier this week with a $1.99 paid download model.Lively, on the other hand, is a free download with three free exports and unlimited previews. To unlock unlimited exports (making the whole thing worthwhile), users must fork up a $1.99 in-app purchase.You can download Lively here.
