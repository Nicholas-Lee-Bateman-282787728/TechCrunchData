On-demand service Postmates just closed an $80 million Series D round.The company told TechCrunch that the new funding values them at close to $500 million.The roundwasled by Tiger Global Management, and followsa $35 million round closed in February.Bastian Lehmann, co-founder and CEO of Postmates, announced that the company has surpassed 2.5 million deliveries across 28 different markets.Lehmann also wrote that gross profit is on track to grow more than 10x in 2015 compared to the previous year.Originally started as a courier service for delivery from anywhere, the company has recentlyformed partnerships with popular companies, such asApple, Starbucks and Chipotle.One of the biggest downfalls with using Postmates is the hefty delivery fee, which can range anywhere from $5 to almost $20, depending on a users distance from the pick-up site.However, Postmates recentlylaunched the Postmates Merchant Program, which offers a $4.99 delivery fee for more than a thousand restaurants. In return for being prominently featured in the app, preferredrestaurants payPostmates about 15 percent of the order total. This new revenue source has allowed the company to reduce delivery costs for the user.While this preferred merchant program only started 10 weeks ago,Lehmann told me that 20 percent of all Postmates orders are now from a preferred merchant.He also said that these reducedfees have caused order frequency to almost double.Lehmann also hinted at a future product that will even further reduce delivery fees. While he wouldnt give specifics, it seems the company is working on software thatallows couriers to deliver multiple orders in one trip, presumably like an UberPOOLfor deliveries.Notably, the company saidthat none of this new funding will subsidize delivery costs. When asked to comment, Lehmannsaid that the company is making money on every delivery, and short-term subsidization is something he has very little interest in doing.WSJoriginally reported the news of the new round.
