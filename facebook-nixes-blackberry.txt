BlackBerry-loving device clutchers are facing a tricky choice if they wish to continue to interact with their friends: WhatsApp, Facebook and Facebook Messenger all hit the unfriend button on the struggling phone makers latest operating system, BlackBerry 10.Facebook-owned WhatsApp made a hesitant and half-hearteddebut on the BlackBerry platform three years ago, and announced at the tail-end of last month that itwas rescinding that decision.While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they dont offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our apps features in the future, the company announced. They areshutting down support for BlackBerry, along with operating systems like Symbian S60, S40 and ancient versions of Android.We are extremely disappointed in their decision as we know so many users love these apps. We fought back to work with WhatsApp and Facebook to change their minds, but at this time, their decision stands, a spokesperson for BlackBerry wrote on the official BlackBerry blog.Facebook said that 99.5 percent of smartphone sales today arecovered by mobile phone operating systems from Apple, Google and Microsoft.BlackBerry users will continue to be able to use the mobile web version of Facebook to post and consume content, but without a native client, it will be hard to deliver a reasonable user experience forBlackBerry 10 users. Having said that, not all hope is gone: BlackBerry 10 does support Android apps as well, via  bizarrely enough  the Amazon app store.For customers who care about social media, this move likely means buying a BlackBerry is off the table, which is undoubtedly a hard blow for the company. On the other hand, BlackBerry has been aimed more at the corporate/enterprise market for a long time, and its possible thatthe lack of native social media clients is less of an issue for that reason.Its unclear whether Facebooks vote of no confidence is just a little bump in the road, or yet another sign that BlackBerry is circling the drain. The stock market doesnt appear to have reacted negatively to the breaking news, but I, for one, am happy I dontown any BlackBerry stock.UPDATE: We updated the article to reflect that BlackBerry 10 phones are able to run Android apps.
