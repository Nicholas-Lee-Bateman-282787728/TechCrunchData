Streaming services are continuingtheir march into Hollywood, competing head-on with network television not only for viewership numbers, but now also for critical acclaim and industry recognition.At last nights Primetime Emmy awards,services including Amazon, Netflix and  if you count it  HBO, which this year launched its own over-the-top option for cord cutters with HBO NOW, dominated the annual awards show, scoring trophies for Transparent (Amazon), Orange is the New Black (Netflix), Game of Thrones (HBO) and Veep (HBO).HBO was the big winner of the night thanks to both Game of Thrones and Veep. The network, today available cross-platform to both cable and satellite TV subscribers through HBO GO in addition to those without payTV accounts through HBO NOW, won a record number of Emmys this year with 43 wins following 126 nominations.Thats only one win behind the record CBS set back in 1974.While HBOs network is still often thought of only as a premium cable TV offering, the channel in more recent months has made several moves to better compete in the new streaming video landscape where services like Netflix still reign.For example, HBO this yearscored a notable five-year deal with Sesame Workshop to broaden the type of content it offers. The deal will see HBO gaining access to first-run episodes of the childrens TV show Sesame Street starting in the fall.It also this springlaunched HBO NOW, a dedicated app that allows consumers to subscribe to HBO programming without a traditional pay TV subscription and then watch on connected devices, including smartphones, tablets, televisions through streaming media players like Apple TV, and the web.In other words, HBOs Emmy victories arent necessarily a win for the old-school network TV model, but rather an indication that consumers today are watching television programming in new ways  streaming, over the top, on mobile and elsewhere.Meanwhile, Amazon and Netflix also walked away with a handful of Emmys, following last nights show and the earlier Creative Arts Emmys.Amazon won its first Emmy for Transparent, where Jeffrey Tambor won for lead actor in a comedy for his role in the critically beloved series. Transparent, which depicts a father coming out to his family as transgender, is an ideal example of the kind of niche but quality programming that streaming services can deliver to audiences. The show may not have succeededon traditional network television, where the humorous, but also deeply introspective series, could have had trouble gaining the number of viewers required to keep it on air.Transparent director Jill Soloway also won last night, while the three other Amazon Emmys, including one for Transparent guest actorBradley Whitford, had been handed out at the earlier-held ceremony.Meanwhile, Netflix won fewer Emmys than Amazon.The streaming network took homejust four Emmys despite having received 34 nominations to Amazons 12. This was a decline from last years seven Emmy wins for Netflix. However, in 2014, Netflixs awardswere handed out at the Creative Arts Emmys, while last night,Uzo Aduba (Orange is the New Black)took the stage following her winfor Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.For Netflix, the decrease in wins could be attributed in part to the fact that its critically acclaimed show Orange is the New Black had to compete this year as a drama, not a comedy.Netflixs newshow Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Amazons Transparent both lost out to HBOs Veep for Outstanding Comedy Series. And Netflixs Orange is the New Black and House of Cards lost to HBOs Game of Thrones, which won for best drama.The Emmy wins for the streamingservices follow Netflix and Amazons decent showing at this years Golden Globes, wherethe two also walkedaway with a number of awards.
