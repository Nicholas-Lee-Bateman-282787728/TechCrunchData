Apple has finally done what many had long hoped it would  released an official dock for Lightning-sporting iPhones, ranging from the 5 all the way up to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The new design should work with devices going forward, too, unlike previous Apple docks, because it features a freestanding Lightning connector that doesnt require your device to fit the dimensions of a set slot.The new dock retails for $40 via the U.S. Apple Store (prices vary by country) and offers a fairly basic design, with a rounded rectangular white plastic base and a single male lightning rising from the top. The Lightning connector comes from what looks like a reinforced protrusion, which probably helps it avoid wear and tear from the weight of the device it supports.The Lightning Dock has two ports at the back, one for Lightning to support charging and data connectivity, and one 3.5mm stereo headphone jack to support audio out. The connector also has the necessary pins to support headsets and play-pause control that work with iPhone.
