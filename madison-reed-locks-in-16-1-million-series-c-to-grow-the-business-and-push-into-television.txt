At-home professional hair color delivery startup Madison Reed tells us theyve pulled in $16.1 million in Series C financing to scale the business and invest in expanding marketing, specifically on TV.The move to television commercialsis interesting, considering so manycompanies  particularly in the startup space  seem to favor digital marketing tactics such as ads on Facebook and Twitter to reach their audiences.Traditional television viewership ison the decline for womenaged 18-24.Shows like The Mindy Project and New Girl are more likely to get views online than they are on your regularly scheduled programming (and account for The Mindy Projects move from FOX to Hulu this season).Madison Reed said it spent the first 18 months since launchunderstanding its customer base  one full of women looking to cover their grays with an upgraded salon-type coloring kit, but in the privacy of their own home.Part of the television push comes from a relationship with Comcast Ventures, a new investor for Madison Reeds latest round.I saw how exceptionally ambitious the company is, and Im looking forward to continuing the relationship to innovate their product and the way they connect with their audience through TV and our media channels, managing director at Comcast Ventures Sam Landman said of the investment.Comcast Ventures and Shea Ventures are joined by existing investors Norwest Venture Partners and True Ventures.While there are plenty of at-home coloring kits on the shelf at the local drug store and several options to choose from in coloring at the salon, Madison Reed promises the same results as salon pros, but with a kit you can use on yourself at home.One other company could compete with Madison Reed in the space. eSalon started out with $11 million in bootstrapped funding and told TechCrunch it is a self-sustaining and profitable business (slated to make about $30 million by the end of this year). It also does practically the same thing as Madison Reed  shipping professional hair color to the customer. However, eSalon personalizes the color match to your hair.Hair care makes upthe third-largest portionof the beauty market globally, and both eSalon and Madison Reed seem to be growing up and to the right, according to their metrics. However, its the relationship that matters most to Landman in the Comcast investment with Madison Reed. Weve had a long-standing relationship with Amy Errett, who we believe is a fantastic CEO capable of building a world-class brand, Landman said.
