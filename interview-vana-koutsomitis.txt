Its Valentines Day, so what better time to interview Vana Koutsomitis, the self-proclaimed dating expert and finalist of this years U.K. version of The Apprentice.The latter she developed when she was forced to go on gardening leave between the last days filming of The Apprentice and when the show airs and the winner is actually announced.However, her latest project (and the startup idea she pitched on the show) is DatePlay, a new dating app that promises to gamify the online dating process.Specifically, it aims to eliminate self reporting  the tendency to create an online profile as youd want to be seen rather than how you actually are  which, argues Koutsomitis, typically results in a string of poor matches and, ultimately, the failure of online dating. Thats something shes determined to fix.Listen to a lightly edited version of the interview below.
