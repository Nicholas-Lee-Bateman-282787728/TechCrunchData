The premise is simple: tap a button, get into an Uber and have no idea where youre going.Actually, that sounds like a really awful nightmare I had once.Bar Roulette is a fun mashup built by Tyler Swartz during a hackathon that takes advantage of Ubers API. It chooses a random bar based on your location and its reviews on Yelp. Its a pretty cool way to explore your surroundings and get really drunk at the same time.This could be fun for groups, a first date or when grandma visits.Its just a web app right now, but Swartz says hes working on a native version. Id like to see Lyft and Foursquare options, even though Yelp reviews can be extremely fun to read.For some of us, Bar Roulette is something that happens every weekend, no app needed. For the rest of you, go ahead and give this a whirl.
