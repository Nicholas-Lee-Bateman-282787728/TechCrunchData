Thedoctor behind those doctor-recommended pills ismost likely someone who is paid to tell you that something will workfor you whether or not it actually will.Thats why on-demand digital health app HealthTap says it undertooka project to gather the drug recommendations of over half a million medical doctors and put them together in a new initiative called RateRx.HealthTap is known for offering on-demand patient treatment services through its app. RateRx launches as a new service on HealthTap that will bea sort of Yelp-like, doctor-recommended drug-review database.The idea is to obtainindependent ratingsof each drug. There are67,000 independent doctors within the HealthTapnetwork who are participating in RateRX, along with half a million more participating through partner networks.HealthTap saysRateRx is the first independent resource enabling U.S. doctors toweigh in on a large-scale evaluation of medications for treatments. Its not, exactly. But it is the first to offer this information for free on a smartphone.The startup has compiled thousands of doctor-rated drugs and added them to the RateRx database. Currently, doctors reviewmedication treatments for conditions such asacne, arthritis, anxiety, diabetes,headaches and hypertension.First Databank MedKnowlegeclaims to be the most widely used and relied-upon drug knowledge base in the United States and Canada. It provides recommendations and insight from pharmacists and other healthcare professionalsfor a fee.There are also several drug database apps on the market. These mostly offer information on drug interactions and side effects.There are plenty of other drug rating sites for those who dont trust the combined doctors recommendations. Sites likeWebMD provide a platform wherepatients canadd their own comparative experiences and interactions with the drugs.HealthTap plans to stick with just the doctorsrecommendations. It became evident that doctors were in abetter position to share their educated and experienced views and recommendations on theefficacy and quality of medications based on years of experience prescribing medicationsand seeing their efficacy with a huge number of patients, HealthTap founder Ron Gutman said.Theplan moving forward is to include more doctors within the ratings platform.RateRX is available starting todayon the HealthTap iPhone, iPad and Android apps.
