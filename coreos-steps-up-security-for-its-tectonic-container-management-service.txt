As containers become more popular as a way to develop and deploy software, its quickly becoming clear that ensuring the security of container deployments isnt always easy. Weve seen a number of initiatives from Docker, CoreOS and others toimprove container security and today, CoreOS is taking many of those concepts a step further with the launch of what it calls Distributed Trusted Computing for its Kubernetes-basedTectonic container management service.The idea here is toprovide enterprises with cryptographic guarantees about their environments from the hardware up to the application layer. This means the customers cryptographic key is embedded in the hardwares firmware, for example, and the CoreOS operating system is verified at boot to make sure it hasnt been tampered with. The system will also only run containers that have been signed with trusted keys.Security is central to our mission here at CoreOS, said CoreOS CEO Alex Polvi in todays announcement. It is rare to be able to introduce a completely new class of computing to the market, and we are proud today to do just that with Distributed Trusted Computing. This is a step further in the security capabilities of enterprises, for the first time giving cryptographically guaranteed end-to-end integrity and control of their environment.The company notes that none of these new features lock a user into the Tectonic platform.Asmore businesses move to deploying container solutions, these kinds of security features CoreOS launched today may soon become standard. Docker is already trying to make cryptographically signing new containers the default, for example. For now, though, it looks like CoreOS is a step ahead of the competition.
