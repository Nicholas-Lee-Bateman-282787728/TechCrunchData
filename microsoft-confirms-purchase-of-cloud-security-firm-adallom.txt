Microsoft announced this morning that it purchased cloud security firmAdallom. According to sources familiar with the matter, the deal cost the Redmond-based software giant $250 million. That dollar amountis below previously reported figures pegging the value of the purchase north of $300 million.The deal was originally reported in July of this year. Given the time it took forMicrosoft to announce the deal, the media appears to have picked up the scent when things remainedinchoate. CNBC reported yesterday that the deal was poised to wrap.Microsoft has made a number of successful purchases following its internationally known deal to pick up the majority of Nokias hardware assets, the best two examples being the companys decisionsto bring Sunrise and Acompli into itsfold for notable sums. The Nokia deals internal combustion that spread short-term conflagration across Microsofts GAAP earnings is perhaps more a warning to not buy too large, instead of not buying at all.Adallom raised more than $49 million from investors over its private life. Now, it will presumably have access to larger coffers. The quantity that Adallom raised from private investors is interesting when compared to the sums raised by Acompli and Sunrise, $7.3 millionand $8.2 million, respectively. Comparing scale of exit prices to amount raised, it seems that Adallom was less lucrative for investors than other recent Microsoft deals.Regardless, Microsofts cloud push continues. Its consistently worth keeping close to the front of our craniums that a Cloud Kid runs Microsoft now, and so to see the firm deploy capital in that direction is precisely not surprising.What Im taking away from the buy is that the M&A team at Microsoft isnt gun-shy, and that the companyis still willing to pay up for startups. Given recent market turmoil, that must make at least one of your Friendly Neighborhood VCs sleep a bit later. At least until the NASDAQ faceplants again.
