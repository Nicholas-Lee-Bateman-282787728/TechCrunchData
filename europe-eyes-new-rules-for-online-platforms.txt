The European Unions executive body has today set out a series of proposals for new rules that would apply to a broad range of online platforms, from the likes of YouTube to Google to eBay, as part of ongoing efforts to boost competitiveness in the region under its Digital Single Market Strategy.The proposalsfollow a year long assessment by the European Commission of online platforms, after which itsays ithas concluded that a one-size-fits-all approach isnot appropriate tomaximize consumer benefits whileensuring effective regulation across all the different types of platforms  so it says it will rather look at each area where it can act from telecoms to copyright rules, to address any specific problems in a future-proof way for all market players.Among the proposed changes isa new set of audiovisual rules with the stated aim of achieving a better balancebetween rules thatapply to traditional broadcasters vs online video-on-demand providers and video-sharing platforms likeYouTube. Key among the ECs concerns here is safeguarding minors.Itsays it wants video-sharing platforms to help come up with a code of conduct for the industry relating to protecting minors online. For the most harmful content (gratuitous violence and pornography) it wants to strict control measures applied to online platforms,such as age verification or pin codes.Under the proposals there wouldalso be a stronger role for audiovisual regulators.At this stage the EC is not includingsocial network platforms such as Facebook  where plenty of video-sharing and viewing now takes place of course  in its definition ofonline platforms but it does say this could change in future. If a particular social media provider meets all the characteristics of a video-sharing platform, they will be covered as such, it notes.These proposals areanupdate to the existing Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AMSD), which has governed audiovisual media in the region for almost 30 years.The existing directivealso includes stipulations to encouragecultural diversity and the free circulation of content within Europe, which the EC wants to see bleeding over to the online platforms that viewers are increasingly turning to in the digital era.Under current rules, for example, TV broadcasters areobliged to broadcast at least 50 per cent share of European works (including national content) in viewing time. This proportion will remain unchanged under the proposal but VOD services would getmore formal obligations  witha proposed requirement thatthey haveat least a 20 per cent share of European content in their catalogues, and give good visibility to European content in anyoffers.Elsewhere, the Commission has also been looking at the rules around ad content, and says it wantsgreater flexibility for online platforms to use product placement and sponsorship  with the caveat that they must keep viewers informed at the start orend of a program. Product placement will still be forbidden in content with a significant childrens audience.Also today the Commissionhas set out additional proposals for updating ecommerce rules with a push to prevent unjustified geoblocking, such as discriminating on price based on nationality or residency, by online platforms.In moves aimed at boosting trust in ecommerce it also wants search engines to be required to clearly distinguish paid placements from organic search results.And theindustry to step-up voluntary efforts to tackle fake/misleading online reviews.Increasing price-transparency and regulatory oversight of cross-border parcel delivery services to boost regional ecommerce is another priority.TheCommission is alsofocusing on controlling the spread of hate speech on online platforms  an issue which has again bubbled to the fore in Europe in recent times, followingthe refugee crisis.A code of conduct the EChas been working on with online platforms is due to be presented in the coming weeks, it said today.The package of measures are proposals at this stage with European law requiring EU Member States to vote on and agree them, and transpose them into national legislation  a process that can take multiple years.
