Some believethat email is bloated and dying, but by implementing advances from itsmachine learning and AI teams, Google has been using Inboxits Gmail-based mobile email client  as a way to raise the bar on how to improve the experience and make it once again into a productive place to communicate with people. Today, the company is taking the wraps off its latest feature: Smart Reply, a way forInbox to craftautomatic responses for you.Google says that the feature, which is due to launch later this week, will work like this: when you receivean email, Smart Reply will read the content of it and selectthree basic responses at the bottom of the screen for a quick response.And for those emails that require a bit more thought, it gives you a jump start so you can respond right away, writesBlint Mikls, a software engineer at Google who worked on the service. That jump start comes in the form of the short phrases that Inbox suggests at the bottom of the screen for the automatic reply, which then become the start of your response.The app also learns as you use it. So, if you never choose, Yes, please send me more information! when replying to a particular person who is pitching you a suggestion for something in an email, its unlikely to keep appearing as an option when that person writes again (and again, and again).There have been a lot of apps that have come out to try to make slogging through your inbox easier, but perhaps most of all Smart Replyremindsme of TL;DR, a little app from one of the co-founders of the now-defunct Android launcher Everything.me, which also set out to make email more like messaging by shortening the steps it took to reply to messages by offering suggestions of how to reply.In both the case of that app and Smart Reply, the pain point is a well-known one: its actually kind of a pain to type on smartphones for most people and so creating ways to circumvent this as much as possible makes a lot of sense.Its also another step along the gradual evolution in how mobile apps are becoming more predictive. Other obvious examples in this vein are services like Siri from Apple or Google Now, or even LinkedIns apps that suggest information about contacts as they enter your vicinity. The bigger idea here is not just that apps are getting easier to use because we have less to input on their small screens, but they are becoming more intelligent and able to act as helpful assistants in our life.This is partly a practical move on the part of developers: the more crowded our phones get with apps, the less likely we are to openthe ones that are difficult to use.But its also a sign of how its likely all apps will evolve over time.Google has over the years built up a massive team of people working in areas like machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence to build out features in search, mobile and many of its applications.And in that vein, Smart Reply is not the first feature in Inbox which wasopened up to all users in May 2015that relies on those technologies. Google also pushes to-do reminders, helps organize trips, and offers assists  small nudges of what you should do next while in the app. In the case of Smart Reply, Google engineers have built the feature usingdeep neural networks, which are also the basis of improvements in Googles voice searchand the thumbnails on YouTube.
