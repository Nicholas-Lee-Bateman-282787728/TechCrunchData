It looks like Twitter is planning to give its users a lot more creativity inthe photo and video department soon. Thats according to numerous images posted by Taylor Swift, Pharrell Williams and others popstars, who appeared to have access to unreleased editing featuresfrom Twitter at MTVs VMA awards show this weekend.Lara Cohen, who is TwittersDirector of Entertainment Talent, highlighted thenew photoswith tweets that implied (and seemingly confirmed) that the starswere roadtesting something new. It isnt clear if this is a standalone app, orjust an extension of the photo/videos features inside Twitters mobile apps. Photo functionality islimited to filters and cropping right now and Twitter only added native video captureon mobile this year. Nonetheless, it looks like youmight soonbe able to add stickers, your own doodles, text and moreto photos and short video clips.OMG @taylorswift13 with these new photo tools. #icant #boom #VMAs #VMAs #VMAs @AmbuLance @jinen https://t.co/5m5GvuBOqf lara cohen (@Larakate) August 30, 2015(@jinen, which is included in Cohenstweet, is the handle belonging to Twitter Product ManagerJinen Kamdar  another hint at something that is, or has been, in development.)More new photo tricks and stickerzzzz from @taylorswift13 all hail the queen!!! https://t.co/btibsViDI5 lara cohen (@Larakate) August 31, 2015I see you w our new cam @Pharrell @ddlovato  https://t.co/t3H4FUXQ2B lara cohen (@Larakate) August 31, 2015Love @BigSean love him using our new camera tools https://t.co/tQnQkMcqS2 lara cohen (@Larakate) August 31, 2015So what is Twitter cooking up?Here are some of the video clips and photos that Swift and co created:When you realize #WildestDreamsToday !!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/IaOGlHNBpC Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) August 30, 2015Headed to red carpet.

Interestingly though, Swifts videotweetsdont show up as being from any client in TweetDeck (heres a screenshot) which you could take to mean it is from a new app. Perhaps maybe.Regardless,it looks like Twitter is zoning in on photos and video. We know people like emoji and stickers, and putting those options right into camera could increaseengagement and convince users topostphotos on Twitter instead of(or in addition to) Instagram, Facebook and other social networking apps. Instagram, in particular, has developed into a juggernault.With 300 million active users, the Facebook-owned photo-sharing app is already bigger than Twitter. It justbegan allowing portrait and landscape photosfor the first time, but offers nothing quite like stickers or text overlays.Weve asked Twitter for more information about what Taylor Swift and the gang wereusing, and when it willbe available for the rest of us mere normals. Well let you know what the company says.Update: A blog post about the U.S. open tennis tournament showed that top tennis players are also playing with the new photo editing options.How about that standalone DM app next, eh Twitter?Hat tip @AnthonyQuintano
