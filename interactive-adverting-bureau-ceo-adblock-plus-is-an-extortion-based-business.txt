Today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY, we had both the founder of AdBlock Plus Till Faida and Interactive Advertising Bureau CEO Randall Rothenberg on our stage  but not at the same time, mostly because Rothenberg refused to even shake hands with Faida in public.Rothenberg minced no words in his dislike for AdBlock Plus, which will whitelist some advertisers if it deems their ads unintrusive (and  for some  when they pay), but he also mixed in a bit of understanding for those who want to use ad blockers.I have no argument against anybody using adblockers because there is a kernel of right when it comes to the impedance of user experience, he said. But as Ive said before, this is an extortion-based business and hurts publishers.Noting that most publishers still earn the majority of their revenue from online ads, Rothenberg also noted that AdBlock Plus is in the business of taking the revenue that these publishers should earn and then divert it into their own pockets.His position, of course, doesntexactlycome as asurprise given that the organization herepresentssees ad blocking as a threat to the free web as we know it.Taking a more conciliatory tone, Rothenberg also said that his organization is working with quite a few ad blocking companies  his problem is mostly with the likes of AdBlock Plus. He thinks they are in the public service business, he said about Faida.He admitted that there are plenty of issues with ads causing slow load sites, but also argued that the IAB is trying to fix this through projects like its lean principles initiative.We are doing everything we can to work with our publishers and ad tech suppliers, he said, notingthatthe main problem here is that the IAB cant exactly set standards and that the Internets open architecture does allow for anybody to get into the ad business.Rothenberg also doesnt think ad blocking will kill online publishers anytime soon.Its still not having that much of an impact outside of tech sites and gamer sites, he said (which isnt great for TechCrunch and similar sites, of course).
