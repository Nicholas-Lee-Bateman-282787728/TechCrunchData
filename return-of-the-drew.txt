TechCrunchhas an unofficial tradition of welcoming people back into the fold. We like to think that they go out into the cold, realize how warm and toasty it is by our fire and want to get themselves some more of that.Today, were continuing the tradition by welcoming back Drew Olanoff to TechCrunch as a Senior Writer. I worked with Drew previously at The Next Web, where he wrote some of my favorite things to read. Drew also spent a while at TechCrunch previously acting as Community Director  but ended up writing because thats what happens here. After that, Drew went to Yahoo to work in comms for a big old tech company, which were calling his purple period. Most recently, Drew was in comms at EyeEm.Drews decade-long history of working with small companies  growing awareness and evangelizing their technology  has given him a unique perspective. But his personality, insightfulness, constant curiosity and genuine nature are what we love best. Also his mom is the raddest.This time around, Drew is here to write  both on micro trends and macro. Big picture analysis and observation about what public companies like Twitter and Google are up to are on the menu, as are morsels about startup trends.You can follow Drew on Twitter @drew, and, finally, again on TC.You can read Drews announcement post here.
