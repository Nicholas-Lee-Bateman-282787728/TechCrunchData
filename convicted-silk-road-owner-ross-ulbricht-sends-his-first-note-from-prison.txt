The alleged mastermind of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, has sent his first note from prison, a handwritten missive posted on FreeRoss.org, a site dedicated to news about the Ulbrichts case and fundraising for his legal costs.The letter was sent to the attendees of PorcFest or Porcupine Fest, a free state festival focused on cryptocurrencies, alternative viewpoints, and Libertarian ideals.Ulbricht writes that he is an eternal optimist and is still hoping for release by appeal.
I have confidence that the appeals court will recognize the errors by some and outright corruption by others in the government and give me some sort of remedy. It could be a new trial, where hopefully the whole story can be told or the case could be dismissed altogether, he wrote.His lawyers redacted and changed parts of the letter. It reads:I hope my story has shed light on some of the issues we face these days. There are many, but please dont let whats happened to me lead you to despair. Keep standing for liberty and respect for our rights. Keep fighting for your freedom and evenutally we will win.Cheers,
RossUlbricht was especially caustic in his mention of the DEA agent who plead guilty to extortion and money laundering during his investigation of his case.
