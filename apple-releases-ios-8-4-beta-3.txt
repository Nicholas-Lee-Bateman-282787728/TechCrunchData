Apples latest iOS 8.4 beta, the third for the next significant iOS software update, is now available. This most recent installment continues to offer a revamped Music app, bringing both function and UI changes to the music playback app, a move many suspect also prefaces the possible arrival of a new iTunes streaming music service at the Worldwide Developers Conference early next month.Reports, including from our own sources, suggest that Apple is planning to debut its new streaming offering at WWDC, during a keynote most likely occurring on June 8, the same day the conference begins. The Apple streaming service will compete directly with the likes of Spotify and be based at least in part on Beats Music, which it acquired last year.Re/code recently shed some light on a few more details about the service, including how itll use free samples and a trial period ranging from between one and three months to promote its paid subscription model.The new Music app appearing in the beta releases carries no overt mention of a streaming service, but instead offers a new look, a new persistent mini-player, new playlist features and easier access to iTunes Radio. The betas appear to be helping refine and zap bugs in this service, and theres a presumption that in a release update, well see the streaming services housed within the Music app alongside local libraries and iTunes Radio, as well.
