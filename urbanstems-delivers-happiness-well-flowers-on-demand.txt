On-demand flower-delivery startupUrbanStemsis expandingto Brooklyn with the promiseto deliver fresh bouquets of flowers, starting at $35, within two hours of ordering.The company launched in D.C. last year, the week of Valentines Day, and expanded to Manhattan in December. Theyve delivered tens of thousands of bouquets, and the company reports thatsales are growing by double digits month-over-month.Co-founder Ajay Kori drew the inspiration for UrbanStems from his own flower-delivery mishap that nearly resulted in a break-up. Intending to surprise his long-distance girlfriend with flowers (which never arrived), he didnt call until late at night, and she assumed he forgot about her.With traditional flower delivery, there are so many people involved that the price gets driven up, but the local florist ends up getting much less than someone walking in their door, says Kori. The Internet has made everything better and cheaper, but in this case its done the opposite.To cut out the middlemen, UrbanStems is working with a network of farms to grow their own flowersand ship them directly to distribution locations across the country.The farms, located in Colombia and Ecuador, are certified by theRainforest Alliance, which meansthat theyre ecologically sustainable andpay their employees fair wages. The bouquets are assembledon the farm, and trucked or flown to the U.S. so that flowers are delivered to recipients within a couple of days of being picked.Typically flowers go from a farm, to an importer, to a wholesaler, to the end florist, where they sit in the store for a while, says Kori. By the time you get them theyve already been off the stem for a week and a half, and theyre starting to die.A handful of venture-backed flower-delivery startups have sprung up recently, namelyBloomThatand BloomNation, but Kori tells me that UrbanStems is the first tovertically integrate operations.UrbanStems is currently available in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Washington D.C., and parts of Virginia and Maryland. The company plans to roll out in additional cities before the end of the year.Our goal is to make gifting a better experience, says Kori.
