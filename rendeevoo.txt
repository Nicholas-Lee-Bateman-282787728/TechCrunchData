Dating apps like Tinder fix the problem of finding someone to go on a date with. But the knock-on effect of that is needing to investtime making small talk on datingapps in order to acquirea date.U.K. startup rendeevoo, which makes an iOS dating app, aims to fix both of these issues in one cocktail-fueledswoop provided you arent someone who relies on thatreal-timechatting component of dating apps to, yknow, assess whether you actually want to spend any time in the same room as this other personor not.If you screen dates at the spelling and grammar stage, rendeevoo is not for you. But if you couldnt care less about how manylols, !!!!s and emojis infest a prospective datesIMspeak  or indeed what they talk about  insteadchoosing toselect a datebased purely on their photos, age and profile, then read onBilling itself as an Uber for real life dates, rendeevoo cuts to the chase by cutting out the chat element.We want to allow people enjoy their real life instead of wasting time in front of their screens chatting with others asynchronously, says co-founder George Christoforakis, who came up with the idea for the app back in 2011, pre-Tinder, after signing up for a dating site for the first time.I quickly realised that asynchronous communications is an obstacle to the ones who prefer to know someone in person rather than through their screen. I also faced the usual threats that exist in such environments, like fake profiles and spammers/scammers, and started questioning the ethics of these big dating providers whose business models highlight a paradox: they promise to match me with the person of my dreams, but they earn money if I dont.Users of rendeevoobrowse profiles and when they like the look and description ofa prospective date they can place an order, just likethey would check-out any other e-commerce item, by selecting when and where they want the date to take place, and then paying for it. Specifically they are paying for one cocktail at one of the handful of East London bars that rendeevoo has partnered with thus far.Once  or, lets be honest, if  the prospective date also pays for their own drink the date is confirmed. Both parties have to confirm beforethe transactions are processed. And it is still possible to cancel a date up to 30 minutes before without being penalized, so this app isnt a perfect fix for beingstood up at the last minute.Users are authenticated via their Facebook profile, and also need to provide card details to pay for drinks (with payments processed via Stripe), so Christoforakis claims theresno risk of being catfished or spammed  something he reckonsis common on existing dating platforms.The appsoft launched in April 2014, but officially launched in beta last month and is now stepping up marketing activity in its East London target area.We came across rendeevoo pitching at our Barcelona mini meet-up, back in February. The London-based startup has raised just under $150,000 over the past 10 months, with around $50,000 pulled in fromcrowdfunding (via Seedrs), and the rest from two angel investors (Georgios Markakis and Cedric van der Haert).Usage thus far is small, as youd expect, with less than1,200 active users at this point, and only five Shoreditch bars to choose from  although thestartup says it should havedoubled that by the end of the month.How many rendeevoo dates have people actually gone on thus far? A mere13, says Christoforakis.The current usage also skews 1:3in favor of male users. And therein, perhaps, lies the rub.Rendeevoo  yet another dating app designedby men  appears to be fixated onfixing more of a male problem(quick date acquisition), and its tacklingthat by removing the screening element which Id wager  pretty much anyfemale (or indeed any discerning person) would tell youis an integral part of deciding whether tobother wastingtime going on a date in the first place.Sure in-app IMingmay be time-consuming, but whats far more tedious is being stuckin a bar with a moron.Still, the app isnt only targeting straightdating. And given its current gender skewit may well be proving more of a hitwith men seeking likeminded men  although Christoforakis says it has no strong bias in any direction at this nascent stage.Our main user is not particularly male or female, straight or not. Of course the value proposition addresses more male users needs, but there is an increasing number of female users who find our product as a great solution to their socialising needs, he says, when I ask who the app is for.A busy young professional, irrespectively of their sex or sexuality, will find rendeevoo as a great choice for a cheeky drink with someone new.We enforce that perception by notpromising a great match. We limit our expertise to the overall experience that is a convenient way to meet someone at a great place today. Even if theres little chemistry between two users, they still had a great time at our partnering bars enjoying a tasty cocktail, he adds.If rendeevoo can locate enough trendy East London quick-after-work-drink seekersto drive significant traction its aiming to monetize the app via commissions charged to partnering bars for each booking.After that Christoforakis says it would look toadd complementary services (such as taxi rides) to expand its revenue generating potential, as well as seekingcommercial sponsorships with drinksbrands.
