While on-demand startups like Uber and BlaBlaCar continue to packwarchests with massive funding rounds as investors bet bigthat leveragingindividual car ownership is the key topowering gigantic transportation/logistics businesses, other startups are taking a different route.And investors arent averse to this oneeither. The underlying assumption beingthatpeople, like devices, will beincreasingly mobile  providedyou make it easy enough for them to get around.European travel planner platformGoEuro has today announced a $45 million Series B round, ledby Goldman Sachs. Other new investors in this round include Atomico, Yuri Milner and Tom Stafford, Sebastian Siemiatkowski (Klarna) and Ilkka Paananen (Supercell).Goldman Sachs is a priorinvestor in Uber  in fact the same group at the investment banking firm led the investment in Uber and GoEuro, according to the latters co-founder, Naren Shaam  sothe firm isevidentlyviewing the two transportation businesses as non-competitive.Which, at least at present, they are.Uber is generally focused on shorter, single leg trips in urban locations, while GoEuro aims to simplify longer distance trips which mightspanmultiple countries.Its more fitting tothink of GoEuroas a long distance version of another European transportation startup, Balderton-backed Citymapper  the latter being focused on simplifyingurban public transport trips within cities like London. GoEuro isrouting similarly complex/multi-modaljourneys but ones thatcan spanborders, not just boroughs.Uber is making inner city public transit systems in a click of a button. We are doing this for intercity transport networks and long distance travel, is how Shaam putsit.GoEuro also supports some ticket booking directly on its platform at this point (in six markets: Spain, France, Benelux and Italy).We are hoping to see more and more people realising that public transportation in Europe is exceptionally good, and a serious alternative to driving a car, if only you have a chance to find the right rail, bus or air connection every time and with a simple transaction experience  which is exactly what GoEuro is about, hesays.BlaBlaCar is also feeding into the GoEuro platform.Shaam dubs them a great partner and saysGoEuro is workingwith them in Germany, Italy and a few countries. Its another mode of transport in our platform.While maintaining its pan-European travel focus, GoEurodoes also support worldwide air travel routes, since its users are not just Europeans but anyone traveling to the region. It has users from some 120 countries at this point.We see everything from short domestic one-way trips to multi-person, long-distance return journeys. Oxford to Reading, Cologne to Paris, Madrid to Malaga, Berlin to Prague, literally everything and across travel modes rail, air and bus, says Shaam, discussing the types of trips GoEuro users are searching for.Our multi-mode travel definitely happens for the more touristy destinations like Heidelberg, but also across tons of smaller non airport locations throughout our core markets based on consumer needs. Given that Europe has about 200 to 300 relevant airports, but more than 40,000 railway and bus terminals the ability to get from point A to B is our focus.Alarge proportion(30 to 40 per cent) of GoEuro users who start offsearching for a particular mode of transport (such as a train), end up switching to an alternative (such as a bus/coach), but, as youd expect, Shaamsaystheres no single mode of transportwinner emerging on the platform, with choices entirely dependent on the route, specific offerings and user preferences. Travel,as a category,containsmultitudes of needs.We sell good volume of tickets across the board for all modes of travel, he adds.Shaam says the new Series B funding will be used for investing in the product, team and user base, as with prior rounds. GoEuroclosed a $27 million Series A back in August 2014. Its seed round was $4 million in March 2013, but was subsequently further topped up in January 2014.Shaamtalksup the complexity of acting as the technologicalconnective tissue linkingso many different forms of transport and regional transportation providers, noting thatGoEuro covers more than30,000 stations (rail, bus/coach) across the 11 countries it operates in at this point.That said, its not the only startupplaying here by any means. The challengesof organizing transport chaos are myriad, but themassivesize of the market morethan$160 billion is spent annuallyon travel across Europe, according to GoEuro  is enough of an incentive to drive plenty of interest here. Competitors in the multi-modal European travel planning space include the likes offromAtoB,WaymateandWanderio. Theres also Loco2, which focusesspecifically on pan-European rail travel.Its easy to underestimate the task of building a simple, unified search and booking tool for all rail, bus and air travel in Europe, addsShaam.Unlike the airline industry, there is no common platform or even agreed data standards for rail and bus operators. And the number of destinations and routes is several orders of magnitude larger than for air travel. So while were very happy to see how far weve got in our first two years and a bit, theres still a lot left to do to make European travel booking become as easy as a click of a button.
