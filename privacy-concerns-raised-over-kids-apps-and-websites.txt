Given the sophisticatedtracking technologies embedded intoso many digital products and services as a matter of course, it shouldcome as no surprise that a global privacy audit of childrens websites and apps has highlighted big concerns aboutthe collection and use of kids data. That doesnt make it acceptable, however.The Global Privacy Enforcement Network, a network of global privacy regulators, conducted a jointresearch project last May, involving 29 data protection regulators looking at just under 1,500 websites and apps targeted at or popular with children. Reporting their findings now, theyve raisedconcernsaboutclose to a majority (41 per cent) of the services, especiallyaround how much personal information is beingcollected from minors and how that dataisthen shared with third parties.Among the overall findings reported by the U.K.s ICO are that:Per country results vary, with Frances CNIL data protection agency saying it found 87 per cent of the 54 websites it looked at were collecting personal data, such as name, email, IP address, identifying the mobile terminal and the users location. And for more than 63 per cent of sites children could be redirected to another website (including a commercial website)with a single click. While just 18 per cent of the subset of sites it looked at prompt users to ask for parental consent to access the content.None of this is surprising, given the rampant tracking technologies developed to monetize free services via ad targeting. But as more regulatory attention is paid to the user data heist thats going on in the background of the digital economy thenmorepressure will build to enforce stronger consumer protections anda stricter data protection regime.In the U.S., for instance, there is a fresh attempt to pass a Do Not Track Kids Act this year. While big tech providers such as Google and Apple have been responding to criticism about how kids and apps collide bycreating dedicatedkids zones within their contentmarketplaces, or offering programs where developers can opt in to an additional review layer, such as Google Plays Designed for Families program, to gain a kid-friendly certification.Such moves are of course welcome but only cover digital products that are availablewithin certain subsections of the Web. If kids are accessing websites and apps that arent explicitly designed for them  such as Tumblr or Twitter or Facebook, for instance  then theres no such safeguards in place. The onus remains on parents to be aware which apps and websites their kids are accessing.Ultimately the core issue here isthedigital economysreliance on ad-powered business models which apparently encourage theobfuscation of userdata collection;disingenuous approaches to gaining user consent for data collection and processing; and a rank lack of transparency about what happens to and with userspersonal data generally.Yet, as barely a week goes by without another huge data leak,digital consumers are bound to start askingmore questions about how and for what purposes their personaldata is being appropriated. And those tech companies thatpublicly stand up for privacy will stand out as trustworthy, while those that keep quiet will seemas if they have something unsavoryto hide.Commenting on the kids-focused research in a statement, the ICOsAdam Stevens said:These are concerning results. The attitude shown by a number of these websites and apps suggested little regard for how anyones personal information should be handled, let alone that of children.Internationally we saw some websites and apps gathering more information than we felt they needed, and sharing that data with third parties.The most common concern domestically was a lack of information being provided about how their information would be used. We saw generic privacy policies that simply werent specific enough, and some without any information at all, which isnt good enough.Well now be writing out to the sites and apps that caused us concern, making clear the changes we expect them to make. We wouldnt rule out enforcement action in this area if required.
