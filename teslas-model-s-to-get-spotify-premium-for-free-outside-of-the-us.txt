If youre buying a Tesla Model S, you can probably afford to bring your own tunes to the mix, but the company has announced today that youll get free Spotify Premium integration with your purchase in Europe, Australia and Hong Kong. Not for the US, but its still one final burn for the previously implemented and now acquired Rdio.Heres what Spotifys Automotive Bizdev head Jonathan Tarlton told the Telegraph:The car radio has not changed much at all, so what were doing with Tesla represents the future. Tesla owners will be able to access a full premium experience, free from adverts.Tarlton also said that the company is not doing making deals: This is a very important focus for us and a key strategy and you can expect many more exciting announcements from us in this sphere.Its a pretty big deal for Spotify.
