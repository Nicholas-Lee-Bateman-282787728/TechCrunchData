Todays episode takes us over the Golden Gate Bridge to Marin Countys picturesque seaside town of Sausalito, which is where Glassdoor calls home. Most tech companies we tour are based in either Silicon Valley or San Francisco, so it was a treat to visit a place that is often more thought of as a destination for weekend hikes and biking trips than the daily 9 to 5 grind. Glassdoors 400-some staffers are a pretty lucky bunch.Check out the video above to see Glassdoors waterfront campus. And tune in every Tuesday for new episodes TechCrunch Cribs.
