When venture capitalists open their wallets and hand out $3.3 million for a seed round, you have to figure the new companyhas some industry veterans with startup experience,and such is the case with Minio, an open source cloud storage product being built by veterans fromGluster.Gluster was purchased by Red Hat in 2011 for $136 million.The round is being led by Nexus Venture Partners and General Catalyst withJerry Yangs AME Cloud Ventures, Index Ventures, Mark Leslie, Brian Stevens, Ben Golub, Lanham Napier and Andrew Feldman also participating.The companyis building an open source cloud object storage project. The early componentsare in GitHub, and the money will be usedto continue developingthe various pieces of the project includingMinio Server, Minio Client and Minio Libraries.Minios founder,Anand Babu (AB) Periasamy says the goal is to provide a scalable, yet simple storage solution built for developers. The idea is to offer an open source alternative to Amazon S3, which is still compatible with the Amazon offering.Miniohopesto democratize storage by offering feature parity with Amazons products in an open source package.Hebelieves that by placing the storage component at the application development level, it can simplify the storage component for the developer community and solve a common developer pain point bytaking a minimalistic approach.JishnuBhattacharjee, managing director at Nexus Ventures Partners sees this simplicity as a key component and one of the reasons his company is financing this project. He says if everything has become software-defined, why should there be this elaborate group to make sure the code runs at scale. Minio wants to put this part of the development process in the hands of the developers.The company is targeting younger developers in particular, which it believes have different needs from the previous generation. Millennial developers demand 4 characteristics in cloud storageincluding thefreedom to run their applications anywhere,easy API-based access,scalability from millions to billions of users andease of operations, according to the company. Minio hopes to solveall of these.Minio is not alone in the open source storage space. Swift and Ceph are alsoopen source projects competing to solve the cloud storage problem, but Minioistrying to differentiate itself by looking at storage as a developer issue instead of one that belongs to IT and offering that simpler approach.As an open source project, its first goal is to build popularity with the developer community, then much like OpenStack or any open source project, it hopes that customers who dont want to deal with open source code will come to them for helpIf its a critical part of the stack, customers will pay,Periasamy said.
