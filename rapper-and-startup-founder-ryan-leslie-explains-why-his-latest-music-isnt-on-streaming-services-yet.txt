If anyone wants to text Ryan Leslie and have a one-on-one conversation with a big-dealrapper, heres his number: 646-887-6978.Thats not a secret. Leslie shares the number publicly and encourages people to message him  its a way for him to develop a direct relationship with his fans. And now with his startup SuperPhone, hes buildingtech tools to manage those messages and relationships.I spoke to Leslie about SuperPhone earlier this week as part of AOLs Build speaker series. Some of this might be familiar if you read about venture capitalist Ben Horowitz backing SuperPhone, but I think Leslie spoke insightfully about his own experiences, how they led to the creation of SuperPhone and where the company goes from here. (For one thing, there are plans for a version of the product that serves regular consumers.)I also got to ask Leslie about the decision to keep his recent music, including his latest album MZRT, off streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. (This discussion starts at around 18:30 in the video above.)I absolutely love all of them, he told me. I love the ability for fans to be able to discover my music. The main disconnect that I have with streaming services  is that if a fan wants to let me know that theyre my number one fan on streaming  as it stands right now, that data is not passed to me.Leslie added that the data issue is something hes been discussing with the companies in question: Once thats ironed out, thats when my music will be back on those streaming services.
