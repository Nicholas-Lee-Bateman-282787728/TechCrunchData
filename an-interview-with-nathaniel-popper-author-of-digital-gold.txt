If youve been reading the site lately youll notice weve gone Digital Gold-crazy. First we started with an amazing excerpt outlining the story of 21.com. Then we posted a review and a podcast and now we present an short interview with the author in our studio in New York.Popper and I go through his theories behind the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, why the couldnt price the book in bitcoin, and how many bitcoins hes holding. Id also highly recommend the book if youre interested in cryptocurrencies. Its a very human story about a very unique technology and well worth a read.
