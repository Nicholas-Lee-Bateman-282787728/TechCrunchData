The 3D printed future is looking increasingly cartoonish ifthis crowdfunderforone-piece flexible nyloneyewear is making a prescientdesign call.Called Mono, the designer specs look like theyve been scribbled onto the models face with a Sharpie marker.Hong Kong based architect Edmond Wong came up with the idea for a single piece pair of specs thatareprinted in one go after having trouble of his own finding glasses that fit.He says he hadexisting experience using 3D printers for making architectural models so put the two together and came up with designs for a range of 3D printed one-piece specs bringingan optician friend on boardfor relevant experience.The Mono design allowsonline buyers to be reasonably confident of a good fit across the range of styles and without trying the glasses on in person because the designs are sized across three points on each pair of glasses, each of which can be one of three differentsize measurements. So the buyer specifies S, M or L for theframewidth, the nose pad, and the length of temples respectively.There are exact millimeter measures for all those sizing specifications, with the medium size being an average, and small and large aiming to cover the extreme cases. Monos coiled hinge design (also necessary for the glasses to be printable as one piece) and the flexible nylon material used for the framesarealso intended to helpachieve a betterfit.Wong says the nylon (fine Polyamaide PA 2000 to give it its technical name) is strong and durable, and able tostand up to UV exposure  as youd hope, given their exposed-to-the-elementssituationBut how do the flexible, one-piece specsstay on the wearers face? The end of the templesbend inwards and downwards slightly so are designed to hug the wearers head, according toWong. The lenses are held in place within the 3D printed nylon frames via grooves, as with conventional glasses. But Mono is making much of the ability to pop out your lenses on demand to switch between standard glasses andtinted and shaded lens as required  i.e. unlike conventional glasses.Wong says Mono has been around 10 months in developmentup to this point. Its been self-funded by him up to now, although he notes that desktop 3D printer prototypingallow for significantly reduced product dev costs and lower risk on such wackily creative gambles.The duo isnow looking to raise around $30,000 via Indiegogo to cover some less incremental manufacturing costs, such as minimum lens and accessories orders, as well as for other areas such as patent applications for their flexible, single-piece hinge design.Early crowdfunder backers can pledge fora pair of Mono optical glasses for $99, or $199 for sunglasses  due toship by August. A combo lens bundle which consists of the frames plus a pair of optical and a pair of tinted lenses costs $135.Whether wearing 3D-printed cartoon specs will make you look stylishor silly is another matter. But additive manufacturing is going to encourage more custom styling to creep into convention  so expect more playful and/or bespoke design to bea future standard.
