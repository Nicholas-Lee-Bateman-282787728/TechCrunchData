For the last several years,Grouponhas been expandingits business beyond the daily dealto position itself as the platform for local commerce. Some of those efforts have proven to be more challenging than others, however.And so, as Groupon nowdownsizesinless profitable areas, its also making a return to productsthat aretried, tested and lucrative.Groupon says that its worked with more than 1 million merchants to date, and in a bid to grow their business with them even more, today Groupon is announcing a revamped and expanded Merchant platform, including a new tablet app for businesses to build and manage dailydeals.The daily deal is not dead!The news comes at a time when Groupon has been shuttering parts of its international operations and reducing its workforce across the boardas the company carries out a more focused approach to its business under new CEO Rich Williams. We need to win where winning is material, he told TechCrunch last month, which includes makingthe hard call to allow the team to focus on what really matters.Most recently, the company confirmed layoffs of 25 people, or one-third of the staff, at Breadcrumb, its restaurant software business. Groupon has been rumored to bepreparing to sunset the Breadcrumb business, although the company has deniedthat this is the case.On a more optimistic front, Groupon beat analyst estimates for the last quarter both on revenues and earnings, and is now training its sights on the stronger parts of its business, 85 percent of which comes from 10 markets and the categories offood, beauty and events.Most customers purchase the Groupon coupons on mobile, and Groupon is continuing to make sure that mobile remains a strong platform on the supplier/merchant side of the equation, too.Weve seen first hand that local businesses can compete in an increasingly connected world and against online giants, and were focused on continuing to enable that competition, said Aaron Cooper, SVP of North America Services, Groupon, in a statement. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to bringing in new customers, which is why were giving merchants every option they need to run a promotion with us in a way thats the most advantageous for their business.Heres arundown of the new features:When you think about it, building Groupons business out from a core of daily deals is smart. Its the first and often onlytouchpoint that many of its customers already have with the e-commerce company, so its a natural startup point for upselling to other services around them, like managing and marketing those daily deals.This effectively means that Groupons customer base is full of people who dont have the resources or interest to hire external IT or marketing staffto handle things like building deals online or social media management. That leaves an opening for a company like Groupon toupsell retailerswith a range of DIY merchantservices to help grow their businesses  and Groupons too.
