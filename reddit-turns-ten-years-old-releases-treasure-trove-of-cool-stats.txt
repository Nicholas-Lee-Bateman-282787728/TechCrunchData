Reddit had its 10thbirthdaytoday and to commemorate the major milestone, they released a ton of interesting data on the sites subreddits, users and content.Amusingly, they also released info on their most popular comments and posts of all time, severalof which were about dicks, go figure.In terms of the sites most viewed posts, Reddits extremely popular AMA with the leader of the free world, President Obama, was second only to an AMA last year from Reddit user DoubleDickDude, a man with two penises.Other interesting factoids from the post include that its most commented-on post of all time was ironically called, Please try to avoid doing things that might stress the servers, such as submitting a post that generates a gigantic comment thread. The blog noted that this post had routinely crashed the servers due to the massive volume of comments (and smart asses) that it had generated.In addition to detailing that the site now receives nearly 230 million unique monthly visitors, the blog post also specified that the site has received a staggering 16 billion upvotes (and surprisingly only 2.5 billion downvotes) since it was founded in 2005.What was also impressive was the sheer amount of page-view volume that the small crew at Reddit has had to deal with. The post said that there were334,626,161 monthly page views per each of the 30 Reddit engineers.Especially interesting was seeing just how successful Reddit Gold has been despite being initially seen as a novelty monetization item. The post said that Redditors had purchased and received 1,867,184 months of Reddit Gold, which runs about $30 for a 12 month subscription.Its not all about dicks and gold, though. The blog post also lauded all of the real-world good that users of the site have been a part ofsince it was founded. Redditors have donated nearly $1.8 million tocauses ranging from disaster relief for Haiti and Nepal to raising funds for school teachers.For more data, check outReddits blog.
