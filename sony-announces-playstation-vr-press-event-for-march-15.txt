With just weeks to go before the first orders of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive find their way into buyers living rooms, Sony is sending out press invitations for a special event highlighting the PlayStation VR to be held on March 15 in San FranciscoThe eventis taking place during the 2016 Game Developers Conference and will begin at 2:00 PM PST followed by a few hours of demos. Last year, Sony used the conference event togive updates on its VR platform, whichwas then called Project Morpheus.Theres still a decent amount we dont know regarding the final release, chief of which are price and release date. Sony has yet to dial in on specifics but the company last referenced the first half of 2016 as a likely timeframe for therelease ofthe headset. In terms of price,BloombergquotedSony exec Andrew House as sayingthat the device wouldbe priced as a new gaming platform.Price maylikelybe the main headline to jump out from this event (if we hear it). With the Oculus Rift priced at $599 and the HTC Vive just recently revealed to cost$799, theres plenty of room for Sony to cement itself as a more approachableoption.One factor driving that is the fact thatmany of the necessaryperipherals for PSVR have already been on the market for a bit and arent all that costly.Its also worth noting that currentversions of thedevicesit a step below Rift and Vivein terms of resolution but will be driven by the PS4 which could serveas both a major asset and liability.The PS4 isa major advantage to the headset in many ways because there are already 36 million VR-compatible PS4 consoles out in the wild right now. Sonyalso already has the benefit of controlling an ecosystem that console gamers have been fully invested in for decades.Sony owning both the headset and the brains powering it will be a score forconsumers whowont have to worrywhether their specific rig can support the latest particularly demanding VR title. On the other hand,this will also be a limiting factor fordevelopers really wanting to push the limits of the VR platform given the PS4s lack of upgradability.It will be interesting to see what Sony ends up revealingat the event and what arsenal of features/titles/specsthey will call upto shift consumer attention toward their VR headset. TechCrunch will be at the press event typing and tweeting furiously, so stay tuned.
