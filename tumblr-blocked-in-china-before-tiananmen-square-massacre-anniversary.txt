Tumblr is now apparently inaccessible in China. GreatFire.org, a non-profit that monitors censorship by the Chinese government, first spottedthe lockout earlier this week..@Tumblr gets completely blocked in China. Sadly, HowHighAreXiJinpingsPantsToday?

The Chinese government cracks down on social media and online searchesannually around the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, which took place on June 3-4, 1989, in an effort to keep news and discussion about it from spreading.There are large rallies every year in Hong Kong to memorialize the event, including one earlier this week. Families of Tiananmen Square victims recentlyaccused the Chinese government of intimidation in an effort to prevent them from talking about the tragedy.Tumblr was also blocked for several weeks in February and March 2011 after activists issued calls for pro-democracy demonstrations on social media platforms.Other reasons why Tumblr might be currently firewalled include a sex tape that is going viral, as Thats Mag notes(online porn is banned in China), and more stringent online censorship measures that include a crackdown on the VPN services many people use to access blocked sites.TechCrunch has contacted Tumblr for comment.
