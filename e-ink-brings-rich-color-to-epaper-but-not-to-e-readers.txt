E Ink, maker of the ePaper displays found in many e-readers (maddening to have three different e prefixes in one sentence, but its unavoidable), announced a brand new type of reflective display that can show a huge range of colors  but the tech is only going to be deployed as signage for now.Color reflective displays are nothing new, but none of the technologies touted over the years have been more than adequate. In person, color e-readers always seemed washed out, which is not good when your competition is glossy magazines and kids books.Diagram showing how the tiny colored pigments are wrangled to produce various hues.That improves resolution, contrast and general display quality  but right now the only panels E Ink has made are 20 inches diagonally and 25001600 pixels. The colors are still muted, too, as you can see in SlashGears eyes-on shots. Great for signage in stores, but at 150 pixels per inch, it wouldnt stand up to close inspection  say, as an e-reader.That said, early e-readers werent so hot resolution-wise or in terms of contrast, and theyve come a great distance since. This is the first generation of the ACeP technology, and its the first color electrophoretic display with real promise. An E Ink representative indicated that its still in the R&D phase, and should be ready to manufacture within two years.ACeP and plenty other fancy display solutions are currently being exhibited at Display Week in San Francisco.
