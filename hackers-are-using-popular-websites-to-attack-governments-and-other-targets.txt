Theres evidence to suggest thathackers are usingpopular websites to attackgovernment agencies, NGOs and other cyber espionage targets with increasingly moresubtle insurgencies.Thats according to the findings of a new report from security firm FireEye, which last month revealed details of a ten-year cyber campaign waged out of China against companies across Asia. The companys newest dispatch sheds light onanother China-based hacking group that used popular Microsoft web forum TechNet to remotely activate malware that couldgrantit access toan organizations internal network and, potentially, troves of private data.The program  run by a group known asAPT17  has since been shut down by Microsoft and FireEye. It didnt appear to posea threat to regular users of the website,rather TechNet was used as a seemingly legitimatemedium through which the group could pull the levers necessarilyto infiltrate a target.In basic terms, APT17  which FireEye said hastargeted the likes of government agencies, NGOs, and legal firms  wouldinitially seed malware with an individual inside a target organization, perhaps using a malicious file delivered viaemail. If the malware loaded successfully, it could be remotely triggered using code that was embedded withina comment left on the TechNet forum.BLACKCOFFEE, the software thatAPT17 used for its offenses, canenable the group to carry out a range of activities, including uploading and downloading files, terminating processes on ahost machine andintroducing other backdoor commands.Though the comments themselves appearednonsensical and spammy, they represented a more covert method of laying an activation code without attracting the attention of internal security systems.Embeddingencoded C2 IP addressesintoa site like TechNet, which is frequently visited by IT professionals worldwide, made detecting malicious activity more challenging than tracingthreats from websites that have entirely compromised for nefarious purposes. In other words, visiting a site like TechNet regularly isnt likely to raise alarm like regular traffic to obscure websites hosted in Russia, for example.This additional obfuscation puts yetanother layer between APT17 and the security professionals attempting to chasethem down, FireEye said in its report.Ultimately, FireEye contacted Microsoft, which locked the groups accounts on TechNet, but itsaid that this strategy  which few security companies have publicly discussed  is likely to become more commonplace as cyber espionagetechniques evolve insophistication.Organizations will need new technology to detect these attacks, Bryce Boland, FireEyes APAC CTO, told TechCrunch in an interview. The case is a reminder that organizations with highly critical environments shouldnt allow people to receive content from the internet.But the onus isnt just on companies to manage their network, Boland added, websites that allow user-generated content  including social networks  should also be wary.You look at a lot of sites and the nonsense that people post in comment sections, but did you ever think it was so bad that it could be an attacker looking for an intrusion? he added.
