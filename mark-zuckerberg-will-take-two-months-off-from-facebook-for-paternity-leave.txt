Mark Zuckerberg, the face of Facebook since the companys founding back in 2004, will be taking a few months off for paternity leave.News of his time off comes by way of  no surprises here  his Facebook:Priscilla and I are starting to get ready for our daughters arrival. Weve been picking out our favorite childhood books and toys.Weve also been thinking about how were going to take time off during the first months of her life. This is a very personal decision, and Ive decided to take 2 months of paternity leave when our daughter arrives.Studies show that when working parents take time to be with their newborns, outcomes are better for the children and families. At Facebook we offer our US employees up to 4 months of paid maternity or paternity leave which they can take throughout the year.Every day things are getting a little more real for us, and were excited to start this next stage in our lives.
Heres a photo of Beast with our baby seat. I think he knows somethings up.Its hard to imagine Facebook without Zuck, even temporarily  but its also not likely that much will change while hes gone, at least without his stamp of approval. He does control  over half of the companys voting power, after all.
