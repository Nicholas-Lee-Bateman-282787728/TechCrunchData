Its appropriate that we started the final CrunchWeek on our DIY set with a conversation about the upcoming IPO of Etsy, the company thats helped turn DIY and crafting into a multi-million dollar platform. Then, our conversation turned to Tinder, which has raised some eyebrows over the past week with its new pricing platform that charges you more money if youre over the ripe age of 28. Finally, we talked about Ellen Pao V. Kleiner Perkins, the ongoing gender discrimination trial thats sure to keep Silicon Valley buzzing for at least a few weeks to come.This episode of CrunchWeek was produced by Felicia Williams, shot by John Murillo, and edited by Yashad Kulkarni.
