Sony announced its new Xperia Z4 in its native Japan last month, and today it has a new smartphone for the rest of us its calledthe Xperia Z3+, notthe Z4, however.As the name implies, the Z3+ is an upgrade on its older sibling device, which was announced last September. Sony has kept the same5.2-inch 1080p IPS screen and, thoughthinner (at 6.9mm) and lighter (144g), the new device is aesthetically very similar to its predecessor.The Z3+srear camera retainsthe same 20.7-megapixels, while the front-facing camera has been bumpedto five megapixels from 2.2-megapixels to help make your selfies clearer and better. With the Z3+, both cameras  not just the rear camera  now packmobile image sensors which help take higher qualityimages in low-light conditions.As youd expect, theres also a new processor under the hood. The Z3+ runsQualcommsSnapdragon 810 octa-core 64 bit processor, which Sony claims gives anything up to 50% more speed than previous processors whilst conserving battery power. For now, we understandthat is up to two days battery life  thats despite Sonys shrinking the devices battery down to2,900mAh (from 3,100Ah) due to accommodatethesmaller size.The Xperia Z3+ is due to go on sale this summer. Sony isnt saying how much it will sell for, at this point, but you can imagine it willget a pricetagsimilar to the Z3 when it launched.Apple went big with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+ last year, and Samsung also threw away some of its core principles for the Galaxy S6 and curvy Galaxy S6 Edge, but Sony has kept to its formula for this years flagship device.While the Xperia Z3 was well received, it didnt set the world alight in terms of sales, and its hard to see how an iterative new version while good on paper  will change things for Sony, which reportedly entertained theidea of exiting the smartphone business.Ultimately, Sony jettisoned other parts of its business to focus on its entertainment and component units, but it could yetreevaluate its smartphone business if things continue as theyve been going.
