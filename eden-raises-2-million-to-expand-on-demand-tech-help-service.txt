Eden, the on-demand tech help service launched out of Y Combinator, has today announced a new chunk of cash to be added to its previously announced (rolling) seed round. This brings Edens total funding to $3.3 million, with this most recent $2 million adding to the $1.3 million the company received in July.Eden is a service launched out of the most recent Y Combinator class that lets users order on-demand tech help, whether it be fixing a cracked phone screen, installing a television on a wall mount, or simply fixing a dysfunctional wireless router.For $69/hour, users can choose a time and location of their choosing to be met by an Eden tech wizard, who will solve just about any technical problem under the sun for that flat rate, bringing their own tools and supplies.The service is currently only available in the Bay Area, but the new funding will allow Eden to expand to new markets.Investors include SV Angel, Redpoint Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Slow Ventures, Comcast Ventures, Index Ventures, Canvas Venture Fund and many more.Eden originally launched with a 1099 employment structure but has since transitioned fully to W2.Eden is currently growing 25 percent week over week since launch in May, but the consumer side is just one slice of the potential market for the company. Though the company hasnt announced or mentioned anything about an enterprise product, the idea makes a lot of sense, and I wouldnt be surprised to see Eden launch an enterprise product sometime soon.Though consumers, especially folks over 50, will continue to struggle with easy-to-use technology, businesses represent a huge opportunity for on-demand tech service given the need for immediacy during a dilemma and their extra financial resources.If you want to learn more about Eden, head over to the website here.
