It took a tragic incident,but Uberis finallyraisingthe intensity with which it checks the background of prospective drivers in India.Four weeks after a female passenger was raped by a driver who had previously been convicted of sexual assault,the U.S. companyannouncedit is working with screening specialistFirst Advantageafter a pilot period and extensive testing of multiple alternatives.Our arrangement with First Advantage brings in additional layers of screening over and above the standard transport licensing process including: address verification, a local criminal court search, and a national criminal database search, Uber said in a statement.The companys initial response to the rapepointed the finger at the current system in India.

However, that Uber isonly now checking drivers with an increased level of scrutiny is of scantconsequence to the victim, who has since filed a lawsuit in the U.S..The new process reduces the possibility of another such incident taking place via Uber inIndia, but the overarchinglesson for Uber (and other companiesthat scale quickly across the world) is to fix fundamental problems as a priority.

SoftBank, the Japanese telecom giant, has emerged as its key rival in India and across Asiavia a series of investments in taxi app companies.
