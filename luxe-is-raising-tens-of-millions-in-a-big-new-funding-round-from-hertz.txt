Luxe is in talks with a strategic investor that will infuse the company with tens of millions in new financing from Hertz, our sources tell us.One source tells us thatthe round could be around $50 million at a pre-money valuation above $110 million. This source also suggested that existing investors may participate in this round. Our understanding is that the round is still getting finalized, and details could change.The Information alsoreported that the funding round is coming from Hertz, and said the round is coming inat a more than $100 million pre-money valuation. This round, according to our sources, has been in the works for a while  as far back as last quarter, when it seemed that it would not be able to close a new round of financing. Our sources stressed that the deal hasnt closed yet.It would make sense that the deal would come from Hertz, which could lean on Luxes model in multiple markets in order to offer consumers a way to park rental cars on demand.Luxe offers customers on-demand parking on both a subscription and one-off model for a fee. Its available in markets like San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. The play here is that these cities are so congested that parking is a pain for drivers to the point that theyll be willing to pay for someone else to park their car. From what we understand, the subscription model is quickly becoming one of its largest growth-drivers, and the company may be putting more emphasis on that.Luxes on-demand parking model has come under a lot of scrutiny, given the end of ZIRXs consumer-facing parking service. However, we do hear from a sourcethat the company is even profitable in San Francisco, which might be why the company was able to secure a new round of financing  even from a strategic investor like Hertz.Luxe has raised $25.5 million in financing prior to this round of funding.A representative from Luxe said the company cant comment on rumors or speculation.
