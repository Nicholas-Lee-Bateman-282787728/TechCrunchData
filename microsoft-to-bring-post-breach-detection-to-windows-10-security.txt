Microsoft announced a new tool today called Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protectiondesigned to help IT detect threats to Windows 10 machines after athreat has penetrated the network.While most security strategy to this point has focused on keeping bad actors out ofthe network, there is a sense of inevitabilitythat no matter how careful a company is that the defenses will break down at some point and hackers will find a way, especially as these attacks become increasingly sophisticated.Were seeing increasingly brazen cyberattacks. Cybercriminals are well organized with an alarming emergence of state-sponsored attacks, cyber-espionage and cyber terror. Even with the best defense, sophisticated attackers are using social engineering and zero-day vulnerabilities to break-in to corporate networks, Terry Myerson, Microsofts executive vice president of the windows and device group wrote in a blog post describing the new product.With Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, IT pros can decide which Windows 10 devicesthey wish to monitor. The new tool searches for problems usingmachine learning based on Microsofts Security Graph, the growing collection of security intelligence information the companyhas accumulated and continues to gather. Itcompares this vast repository of securitydataagainst Windows 10 machines running on the network. If the system detects a probable issue, it informs IT and lets admins investigate further.Myerson points that with machine learning its about probability of a problem, not necessarily a definitiveindication that something has happened, so the system informs the admins about a potential issue and lets them decide how to handle it. For example, the database could include information on anIP address on internet known to give commands to a bot net. If the system finds Windows 10 deviceson the networkhave accessedthis IP address, it will inform IT and let the administrators decide if the company has been attacked.If the administrators determineit is an actual attack, they can take actions to isolate the affected machines.Microsoft is also promising more advanced remediation tools in a future version of the product.Its worth noting that this productis focused on securing only Windows 10 machines for now. It doesnt workwith older versions of Windows and it doesnt help detect these types of breaches acrossthebroadernetwork. It is an attempt to bring advanced threat detection to Windows 10 devices, not a comprehensive security tool.The company has been doing early private testing on 500,000 devices as it developed the product.The tool is going to be released to wider testing soon, although Myerson wouldnt give an exact date for the launch of the wider test.Its worth noting that IBM announced a series of moves yesterday designed to help customers deal with post-breach activity as companies realize there is a market not just for preventing attacks, but also for dealing with post-breach planning and response.Todays announcement is Microsofts first stab at attacking that part of the market.
