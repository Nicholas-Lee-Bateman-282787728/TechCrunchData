Salesforce.com and Microsoftannounced today that the companies would bebuilding upon previous integrationsand further strengtheningtheir partnership.They made the announcement this afternoonin San Francisco at Dreamforce, Salesforces customer extravaganza.The two companies introduceda broad newset of integrations to help Microsoft products work hand-in-glove with Salesforce Lightning Experience, the companysrecently renamedupdate to its core CRM product.Todays announcementincludes building Skype for Business (the product that used to be called Lync) into the Lightning platform, enabling users to make video or voice calls or chat with colleagues via Skype inside Salesforce.In addition, Salesforce will integrate with OneNote providing a way to view and edit notes directly from Lightning, as well as use Microsoft Delve to help sales people discover opportunities within Salesforce.Whats particularly interesting about the latter capability is that it will be built into the upcoming release of Microsoft Dynamics, itsown CRM product. This is more proof that Microsoft is trying to be more open, even allowing competing products to work with its tool set if it advances its overall agenda.Finally, Salesforce plans to build a Salesforce 1 Mobile app for Windows 10, providing a leading mobile cloud tool for Windows 10, which could help give the platform a boost on the mobile side.The companies clearly saw the mutual benefit here with Microsoft getting access to the massive Salesforce.com cloud customer base and Salesforce pleasingcustomers by working more closely with Microsoft tools, which many of its customersare usingtoday. This cross-product integration is something that CIOs have been demanding.Todays announcement builds upon the partnership announced inMay, 2014when the companies began exploring ways to integrate across one anothers product lines. AsTechCrunchs Alex Wilhelm wrote at the time:Salesforce will support Windows, Windows 8.1, build interoperability [between] Salesforce and Office 365, Microsofts subscription-based productivity suite, and integrate OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online, and Outlook in various capacities.Even now after a couple of years of making nice, its hard not to forget that the two organizations were once at each others throats. In fact in May of 2010, Microsoft sued Salesforceclaiming copyright infringement, and Salesforce returned the favor andcounter-sued that June. Obviously thats all in the past now, as working together seems to suit the two organizationsand their customers more than trying to fight one another.Its worth noting that there were rumors this past May that Salesforce turned down a $55 billion offer from Microsoft. Some reports suggested that CEO Marc Benioff was looking for $70 billion. In spite of not comingtogether through acquisition, the companies are forging ahead with a tighter intermingling of their product sets
