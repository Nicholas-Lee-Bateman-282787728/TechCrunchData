SeamlessDocs, the document automation portal for governments, has announced the close of a $5 million Series A funding round led by the Govtech FundThe startup originally launched as Bizodo out of the ERA Accelerator and has since re-branded and re-focused on bringing governments into the now-paperless world we live in.SeamlessDocs takes what has traditionally been an offline experience with government forms and puts it all online, on any device. This means citizens can take a government form, like a 1099 form for contractors, and fill out the entire thing online, including legal eSignatures.Any PDF can be converted into a smart form, which can be filled out from any device, and SeamlessDocs also allows customers to integrate attachments and payment.With focus on the government, not only does the experience of filling out a form become much easier for citizens, it also saves the government money that would be spent on data entry and paperwork processing.SeamlessDocs has signed up hundreds of governments in almost every state across the United States, with the city of Los Angeles being one of the largest clients.Pricing for the product is in the thousands of dollars and ranges from government to government based on population.You can check out SeamlessDocs right here.
