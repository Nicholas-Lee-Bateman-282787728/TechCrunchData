The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) launched a new simple tool today, Democracy.io, which allows users to contact their representatives in Congress in an incredibly easy manner. The process begins with the user entering in their address which pulls up a list of their representatives and allows them to start typing an email to them immediately.Being able to contact your elected representatives is a critical component of a healthy democracy. Making sure that its a simple and rewarding process should be one of Congresss priorities, but unfortunately it doesnt seem to even be on their radar, said EFF Tech Fellow Sina Khanifar in a blog post.Its a pretty stylish solution to an task that shouldnt be as hard as it is. Democracy.io is all about facilitating an easier connection for holding lawmakers accountable.EFF Activism Director Rainey Reitman said:Democracy thrives whenthe voices of Internet users are heard in Washington. The easier it is for you to reach your member of Congress, the better. With Democracy.io, you can send one message to both your senators and your representative right away, instead of tracking down three different forms on three different websites. We are proud to open this tool to the public and increase lawmakers awareness of how their constituents really feel.
