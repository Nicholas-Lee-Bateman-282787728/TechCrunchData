Tuesdays are special. Besides the fact that my favorite bar has $1 oysters that night, TechCrunch Radio also airs every Tuesday evening at 6pm ET / 3pm PT.John Biggs and I discuss the latest in tech news for the first half hour and then we dive right into the TechCrunch Radio Pitch-Off. Five companies have exactly 60seconds to pitch their products to a special guest judge, John Biggs, myself, and our listeners, and after a brief Q&A for each company, we deliberate live to decide on a winner.Its fast-paced and fun. You should definitely be a part of it.If you want to apply to be in the pitch-off, follow the instructions below.Rules:
