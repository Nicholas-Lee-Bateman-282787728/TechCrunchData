Triplebyte, a technical recruiting platform co-foundedby former YC partner Harj Taggar, Ammon Bartram and Guillaume Luccisano,just raised $3 million from a long listof investorsin the YCfamily.Those backersincludeInitialized Capital (a fund originally started by Taggar, Garry Tan and Alexis Ohanian), Ray TonsingsCaffeinated Capital,SV Angel,Felicis Ventures,Sam Altman,Paul Graham,Jessica Livingston,Paul Buchheit,Trevor Blackwell,Geoff Ralston,Kevin Hale,Drew Houston,Greg Brockman,Elad Gil,Tikhon Bernstam,Eric Wu,David King,Michael Seibel,Emmett Shear,Justin Kan,Kyle Vogt,Robby Walker,Daniel Gross,Ilya Sukhar,Joe Greenstein,Bill Clerico,James Beshara,Jared Friedman andJake Gibson.Triplebyteis building a more automated way of sifting through engineeringcandidates for startups.If you talk to anybody based out here,the #1 thing they say its that its impossible to hire engineers, Taggar said. Its the most talked about problem.Triplebytehas amulti-step process involving a blind screening and coding testthat then moves tomore thoroughphone interviews. If candidates pass these first phases, Triplebyte willalso flypotential hiresout to West Coast and set them up with a gauntlet of in-person interviews with YC companies.Taggar says that the company has refined the interviewing process to a point where they now want to scale it. Theyve also mapped out all the attributes that YC companies favor in technical hires, and theyre using that as atuning filter.Taggar found that every startup has a slightly different idea of what it means to be a great engineer.The company isntdisclosing the number of hires it has placed so far, except to say that the company is profitable.We didnt actually need the money in terms ofsurvival, he said. Were already placing enough people to profitable per month, and were not talking Ramen profitable.'
