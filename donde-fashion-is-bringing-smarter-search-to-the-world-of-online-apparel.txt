Shopping online for clothes can be a real pain, especially when youre searching for something very specific. Sure, most retailers have filters for tops, pants, dresses, etc., but most dont get any more granular than that.Donde Fashion, a platform that currently offers items from more than 6,000 brands, is looking to change all that.Through the Donde Fashion app, users can search across multiple brands using filters for clothing type, color, length, pattern, price, and of course, brand. But it goes beyond that.To make things easier on the customer, Donde Fashion ditches text search and opts instead for icon-based search, letting users simply tap on an icon for a specific color, pattern, etc. to find all items that match that description.While it may seem like icons would actually broaden the search, they allow the user to get as specific as a neckline on a dress or the length of a pant leg by simply seeing the options and selecting them. This means that users dont have to actually know exactly what they want, and try to put it into words, but can rather choose from a number of options.The app also offers a social component, letting users follow various brands and friends so that they can get style tips from folks that they trust. As expected, the app includes a wish-list so that users can store their favorite items.In terms of revenue, Donde Fashion takes a slice of each transaction made through the platform. Some of the Donde Fashion partner brands include Banana Republic, Zara, J. Crew, Bloomingdales, Barneys New York, among others.You can check out the Donde Fashion website here or hit up the App Store to download the app.
