Weve made it! 2015. The year of hoverboards and self-tying shoes, according to Back To The Future.So far, we have neither of those things*. But we do have this absolutely ridiculous iPhone case modeled after Doc Browns DeLorean, so weve got that going for us.(* though Nike keeps saying theyll release a pair of self-tying Power Lace shoes this year)While nifty beyond reason, the case is admittedly a bit silly. It makes the already portly iPhone 6 considerably bigger, and requires you to slide parts of it around to use the camera, and open the cars doors to use the volume buttons. Its perhaps the least practical iPhone case imaginable, outside of encasing your phone in concrete.But practicality? Where were going, we dont need practicality.I mean, come on. It lights up when people call! The headlights blink with your ringtone! It makes it look like youre holding a massive toy car to your face! Whats not to love?Built by Bandai primarily for distribution in Japan, the case is available for pre-order and is set to cost 5,940 yen  or roughly $50, at current exchange rates. Alas, it doesnt look like Bandais ordering system lets you ship outside of Japan so if youre trying to get one of these stateside, expect a bit of a markup.
