Ive had a pretty decent amount of conversations with my college roommate about his great distaste for the fact that almost every new device in existence is connected in some way to the web. Light bulbs with WiFi would have likely seemed to be a truly ludicrous concept a few years back but now I rarely bat an eye as I immediately archive the cavalcade of connected bulb pitches to my spam folder.That being said, as bizarre as some connected product concepts may seem, occasionally theres something that clicks. This CES, that was the smart duck, which is, in fact, a $99 high tech rubber duck for kids.I had the opportunity to gain a little face time with the little guy at CES and also chat with Garrett Curry, brand manager for Edwin the Duck, in the video above.
