Good Eggs, anonline service that allows you to order food from local farms, has brought on a new CEO  Bentley Hall, whopreviously held senior rolesat Plum Organics, Clif Bar and Johnson & Johnson.The companys existingCEO Rob Spiro (pictured above with Hall) will become chairman. He said hell remain very active in the company, and suggested that Hallis really coming on as a partnerto me and toAlon [Salant], my co-founder.The headlines about Good Eggs havent been great this year, withmultiple rounds of layoffs, and the shutdown of operations outside of San Francisco. However, Spiro said the company continues to do well in its home base of SF, with sales growing every week and recently crossing $100,000 in a single day for the first time. He also said its been addingimprovements like next-day delivery, recipe content and a new iOS app.So Spiro argued that bringing on a newCEO is helping Good Eggs scale and doubling down on whats working.Hall added that his experience in organic food will informhis approach to Good Eggs, because that experiencehelped him understand the need to gobeyond marketing fluff, to connect to farmers, to create a strong company culture  and yes, to achieve scale.One thing that would probably help the company grow? Moving beyond SF (again). Spiro said Good Eggs is looking to at geographic expansion in2016, thanks to significant improvements in its model.Were solving a really hard problem, he said. Were not just building one magic bullet app, were building an entirely new supply chain. Its a full stack. Weve been making improvements at every level, and we will continue to make improvements at every level.Good Eggs investors include Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures
