Workspot, an aptly-named virtual desktop startup, is planning to improve its tech and expand its enterprise sales team after raising $5 million in new funding led by Helion Ventures, with participation from Translink Capital and Qualcomm Ventures.The Cupertino-based companysnew funding allowsit to add an enterprise sales team that will target Global 2000 companies. Workspot alsoplans to add more users at its existing clients, which include mid-sized and Fortune 500 companies.While other SaaS companies also make virtual desktop software, which allow workers to access their employers apps and documents from their personal computers, Workspot says it differentiates by allowing clients to run its platform without having to install new servers or cloud infrastructure.On the other hand,Amazon WorkSpaces, one of its largest competitors, runs on Amazon Web Services and requires IT departments to move their software and data into the AWS cloud.This raises security questions, in addition to the complexity of moving apps and data into a third-party cloud. The Workspot solution leverages existing security models and infrastructure, says co-founder and chief executive officer Amitabh Sinha. IT does not need to move their business apps or data anywhere.To use Workspot, employees open its client or app on their PC or mobile deviceand enter a PIN. Then they are presented with a virtual desktop that includes all their business apps, files and a VPN.Workspot recently added Mac support in response to the increasing number of organizations and executives that use Apple products, which might attract new clients who are currently running Windows virtual machines on their home computers. The launch also allows them to benefit from the release of the latest Macbook Pro with Retina Display.
