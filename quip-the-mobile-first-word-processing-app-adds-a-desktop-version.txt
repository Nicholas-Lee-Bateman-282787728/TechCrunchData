When Quip was first debuted to the world two years ago by co-founder and former Facebook CTO Bret Taylor, its unique selling point was that it was a mobile first word processor, built for the always connected, always collaborating smartphone and tablet generation. Fast forward to today, and things are evolving  or taking a step back, depending on how you look at it: The startup is releasingits first official desktop apps for Mac and Windows.Its a somewhatironic turn, given that when he was first launching Quip, Taylor mocked legacy word processing programs, noting thatIts comical how similar [MacWrite]looks likewhat we use today and how most desktop programs dontaddress how consumers are turning away from legacy computing devices.So why the change of heart? Quip is following its users.Quip today has over 30,000 businesses and millions of individuals using its apps, including companies like Facebook, CNN, Instacart and Al Jazeera  a figure that has grown dramatically since the company launched spreadsheets last October (when it only had 10,000 business customers).Thats meant weve had an explosion of desktop website usage, he says. As a point of comparison, in January 2014, the split between mobile and desktop was 80/20. Today, its 50/50, Taylor says. While those desktop userscould access documents through the web,was time to give them a dedicated native app.While the app gives users more parity between desktop usage and Quip mobile apps  same features to access and modify documents, and also provide a space for coworkers to comment on them and other things  it also has a few features unique to the platforms on which it sits. The Mac version, for example, integrates with Spotlight search, and also gives users native notifications when documents that their tagged or working on get modified.With the update, Quips also opening up a bit more about how its architected its whole service, which in itself is a pretty fascinating idea and points to why the company thinks that  even as a later entrant into desktop word processing against incumbents like Microsoft Word, or cloud-based services like Googles Apps  it has a distinct advantage.In essence, as Taylor describes it, Quip has abandoned the concept of a file. Instead, it hasbroken down documents into small, more granular modules.This gives Quip documents some very interesting usability characteristics.First,when two or more people are working on a document, you can edit different sections simultaneously and they are much easier to integrate with each other.What it also means is that if you are offline and are editing a document, and someone else is editing it elsewhere, you are less likely to have conflicts between versions, since the only parts being impacted are those more granular sections that you have modified. Taylor tells me that in cases where thereare conflicts, the two versions of the fragment in question are saved in the collaboration notes that are always present alongside the document so that you can decide which revision wins.Second, the more granular segments for the files also means that when a document is being accessed, read and edited, it behaves in a much faster way than your typical, possibly more choppy version being accessed from the cloud.Offline and online are no longer separate binary states, he says. Our perspective is that online and offline should havea much more seamlesstransition. This is more than just a concept. In action, files in Quip never download or work in a stuttered way in the cloud. While they remain in the cloud, they perform as fast as if they are local files.You can read more about how the apps are designed here.Quip the startupis not revealing anything about revenues or other numbers that might speak to how well it is doing  its service pricing ranges from a free tier, to $12/user/month to larger enterprise deployments that are priced on an ad hoc basis.However, Taylor says that its doing well enough that it has burned through a lot less of the cash that it has raised so far and is not in any hurry to raise more  although it hasnt been for lack ofVCs knocking on its doorregularly.To date, the company has raised $15 million from investors that include Peter Fenton, Yuri Milner and Marc Benioff.
