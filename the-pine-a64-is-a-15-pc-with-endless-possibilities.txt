PINE64 has so far raised over $1.4 million in its Kickstarter campaign for their tiny, yet versatile, $15 computer. The Pine A64 costs less than three bottles of asparagus water from Whole Foods, but for that price you get a1.2Ghz board, 512MB SDRAM, 10/100Mbps Ethernet Port, 3.5 MM Audio/Mic Output, 4K HDMI and 2 USB ports.I had the chance to chat with Johnson Jeng, Pine64s co-founder, about some of the cool things their little PC could do, check out the video above for my interview.
