Sometimes you just dont know what to search for.Maybe youre trying to identify a landmark or find out some details about acool-looking restaurant. Rather than search the web with endlessly vague keywords stacked on top of each other, PHIND is hoping you just open up your camera app.PHIND enablesusers to search just by snapping a pic of a physical location. After users do so the app combs through geolocation data and intelligently filters through a library of photos to pinpoint exactly what youre looking at. Once it zeroes in on the location, the app aggregates relevant data from services likeYelp, Foursquare, Wikipedia, TripAdvisor, Viator and Uber to give you a wide range of useful snippets on that location without you having to jump endlessly from app-to-app.Since being votedthe Startup Battlefield Wildcard Winner at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York earlier this year, PHIND has been busy raising cash and making improvements tothe app. The companyjust announced that they have closed a $755k round of seed funding. Theyrehoping to use this newly-acquired capital to improve their core technologies and begin pursuing more sustained marketing efforts.Launchingalongside this funding announcement is a pretty major overhaul of the app. PHIND 2.0 places more emphasis on the unique experience offered by the apps aggregation of other services. To make that feature more accessible in circumstances whenyou do know exactly what youre searching for, this update introduces type and categorysearch to function alongside the photo search.I chatted with PHINDs CEO Rishi Jhunjhnuwala who told me that his goal with this release was really to ensure that the app was accessible in all circumstances to users, and that meant expounding onthe original idea of photo-based search a bit.People were telling us that they really loved the way we presented content and they loved theinformation they were getting but that there were times when they knew exactly what they were searching for but still wanted access toour content,Jhunjhnuwala said.Jhunjhnuwala said this expansion really helps PHIND avoid the trap some of its competitors have fallen into: carving out too specific a niche and being reduced to a novelty discovery app.PHIND 2.0 allows the company the freedom to put more resources towards refining the content aggregation side of the appwhile also giving them the chance to make the product more accessible to more frequent users.
