Starting with next school years class of freshmen (class of 2020), students inChicago Public Schools willbe required to complete curriculum around computer science before graduating.This has been a long time coming. Back in December 2013, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced a five-year plan to make CS a core subject taught in schools, and partnered with Code.org around providing the curriculum and preparing teachers to make that possible.Making sure that our students are exposed to STEM and computer science opportunities early on is critical inbuilding a pipeline to both college to career, Emanuel said in a release today. Requiring computer science as a corerequirement will ensure that our graduates are proficient in the language of the 21st century so that they cancompete for the jobs of the future.Currently, computer science is only offered in 25% of schools across the nation. In Chicago, 107 schools have implemented CS curriculum, 41 of which are high schools, according to the districts press release.The Chicago Public School district is working with Code.org and other organizations to further develop a CS education curriculum to implement across all its high schools. Of the courses created in partnership with Code.org, 37% of the students are black or Hispanic and 43% are female.Nationwide, President Barack Obama currently has a $4 billion proposal on the table to bring computer science education to all K-12 schools across the nation.
