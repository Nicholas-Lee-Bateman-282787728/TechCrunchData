Yota Devices, the Russian company that sells two-screenedAndroid smartphones, has a new owner after shareholderTelconet Capital sold its majority64.9 percent holding to Hong Kong-listedREX Global Entertainment for $100 million, according to a regulatory filing.Yota caught the attention with a unique dual-screen smartphonewhich takes aim at the increasinglyhomogeneous design of phonesby offering ane-ink screen on itsreverse. Itsfirst device  called simply the Yota Phone  emergedin December 2012 and was subsequently sold in 20 markets acrossEurope, Russia and Middle East. Yota didnt disclose sales figures, but media reports suggestit didnt farewell.The device did manage to build a cut following among those who appreciate something different, though, and its second release  Yota Phone 2  wasbetter received. Indeed,Yotas own Indiegogo campaign to bring the odd-looking phoneto the U.S.ended with nearly$300,000 in pledges, vastly overshooting its initial $50,000 target.Yota has offices inGermany, Canada, Finland, Singapore, and Russia, but it has previouslysaid thatChina  where it has locations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen  is its most importantfocus.China will be the biggest market in terms of volumes, no doubt about that, Yota CEOVlad Martynov said in a February interview with Reuters.Given its interest in China, it makes some sense that Telconet Capital is selling to an Asian investor, albeit one that doesnt have direct smartphone experience.REX Global Entertainments business interests include cruise ships, casinos, property,and even gamma ray irradiation services (!).Representatives for Yota Phone and REX Global Entertainment didnot respond to our questions about the investment at the time of writing. (Well update this post with more details as we hear them.)It isnt clear what plans that Yota has with its new investor on board, but wed suspect that in addition to upping the ante in China, it will look closely at opportunities inemerging markets in Asia, in particularIndia and Southeast Asia. Other Android phone makers like OnePlus and Xiaomi have focused on those regions, where smartphone adoption remains relatively nascent but device sales continue to grow at double and triple digit rates.Martynov is confirmed to speak at our TechCrunch China event in Beijing next month, so we should have a more complete picture of whats on the horizon soon.Yota Devices grew out of the its parent companys telecom business, which is centered around providing mobile broadband services and wireless devices. Yota, founded in 2006,isnotable for being one of the first WiMAX providers, though today it provides 4G-LTE services in more than nine cities across Russia.Hat tip Tech.eu
