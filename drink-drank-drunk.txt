There were inklings of hints that this was the frattiest startup of all time. For starters, the subject line of the email pitch was Not Porn and it was about an app called Drunk Mode thathelps wastoids avoid the unsightly ramifications of getting wasted.The appwas started by Josh Anton in 2013during his time at University of Virginia. He told me that he thought of the startupwhen a friend drunk dialed himat a party at 3 AM and said some things she wouldnt have said sober.I wanted to hear about the ensuing tales of intrigue as him and his frat bros wrestled with starting a totally rad app while also picking up chicks and pounding back natty lights, but alas it turns out that Anton wasnt in a fraternity and doesnt even drink much. This took me back a bit when considering that his productis currently one of the most popular inebriated app aidsavailablewith about750k downloads to date.The app, which Antonso eloquently described as a condom for your phone, is aimed at assistinguserswhove had a few too many avoid making choices that theyll regret, while also helping them keep an eye on their friends.One of the apps central features is a drunk dialblocker which lets you select specific contacts in your phone to hide while youre out.Another section is aimed more towards keeping friends safe, Find My Drunk lets you see the GPS location of buddies that youre going out with(with their approval of course) just to be sure that everybody makes it home safely.Another feature,Breadcrumbs, aims to helpyou find something that you may have lost while you were stumbling home the night before. It does so by gathering passive GPS data and essentially making a map of everywhere youve been over the past day.This is mostly creepy and the data is kind of rudimentary, but if youre party hopping and blacking out, this couldassist you in findingyour phone, wallet, keys and shoes the next morning.The mission of the app can feela bitdisjointed at timesas it balances promoting typical frattiness andsafety. A couple of the new features the app is launching this fall kind of embody that.In September, the app will be announcing integration with Fabriq, a paid service that can help someone in seriously dangerous or life-threatening situations.Fabriqswebsitelists a couple of the upcoming integrations:Added right to the Find My Drunk Map, FABRIQs signature Panic Button keeps you connected. This button texts an alert to loved ones if you find yourself in a dangerous situation and allows them to send out your safety profile to everyone on the FABRIQ network in your area/campus.Safety IdentityIn an emergency, your loved ones can escalate an alert and blast out your profile to everyone in the FABRIQ network thats within 3-5 miles of your last known location.Meanwhile, theyre also focusing on a major feature called Hotspots that will let users check into a bar or frat house and look up the girl-to-guy ratio at the party, basically so people know whether theyre going to score or not.I think its smart for the app to prioritizesafety while also showing off some fun features to attract young college users, but building features like Hotspots and calling it a condom for your phone, might not be thebest marketing moves for an app that can also send out abduction alerts.On the user side, this app definitely has some attractivefeatures, and with a couple hundred thousand active users Drunk Modereally has the potential to make an impact on campuses, especially as college administrations look for student-friendlyavenues to employ campus alert systems.So the next time youre thinkingSmirnoff Ice is the right move for you, perhapsopening this app to help you stay safe and make smarter choices is as well.
