Here at Mobile World Congress 2016, the annual Barcelona-based flesh-pressingof the telco industry, Google and a bunch of carriers have put out a press releasetalking up how they are apparently aligningtotry to drive adoption of RCS.Akathe Rich Communications Services interoperable messaging standardthat carriers have been trying to push for years.Carriers aim with RCS (formerly called Joyn) wasto try to evolve SMS with a new standard that baked inricher features, such asinstant messaging, group chats, file sharing and so on;i.e. the sorts of features now routinely found inover-the-top messaging apps likeWhatsapp and Facebook Messenger. So really that ship has sailed, and thelatter apps are continuing to pull users away from SMS, diminishing theold carrier cash-cow even further.Instead of a new cash-cowcarriers have only alame duck alternative in RCS. And yet theyre still hoping it canturn into a golden goose  hence todays trumpetingBy aligning on a universal RCS profile, mobile operators will be able to deploy a consistent RCS implementation, feature set, and configuration. The Android RCS client provided by Google will be based on the universal profile, enabling consumers to access RCS services on their devices. Features such as group chat, high-res photo sharing, read receipts, and more, will now become part of the operator messaging experience, enhancing the experience of over 4 billion SMS users worldwide. GSMA RCS advanced calling features will also be supported in the future by Google.The profile and client will enable a consistent and interoperable messaging experience between all Android devices and across all operators worldwide, as well as ease interoperability testing between networks and significantly reduce time to market. The universal profile can be implemented by other operating systems and will be supported by a formal GSMA accreditation process. Google will also provide an open source version of the client based on the universal profile specification and will provide developer APIs to enhance the RCS client experience.Thing is, carriers have been trying and failing to get RCS to fly for years, but got bogged down in trying to agree standards for all the various features. And when OTT messaging platform Whatsapp, which is actually a bityounger than the RCS industry initiative,can boast of havingone billion active usersnow its clear whos stolenthe messaging momentum  and its not thecarriers. Apple has also managed to deliver a widely adopted SMS alternative (iMessage) which, while not perfect, is very usable and wellused.Meanwhile the carriersare now onlytalking about building a path to one billion users forRCS (and a target of four billion+ SMS users). Yet,as others have noted, theyre not breaking out any actual activeuser stats for RCS.One billion is also an admission of failure if the original ambition was to build the next gen of SMSGSMA now talking a "path to 1 billion users" for RCS. Given there's c1.8bn Androids, c900m iOS & 4-5bn SMS users = no ambition for ubiquity Dean Bubley (@disruptivedean) February 22, 2016Todays RCS announcement is clearly aimed atgiving the impression of some uplift  with Google cast as the limelight-bringer. After all it is MWC16 and carriers want to be able to dream of golden goosesat their annual Mediterranean confab.Operators have agreed to transition toward a common, universal profile based on the GSMAs RCS specifications and an Android RCS client provided by Google in collaboration with operators and OEMs, the GSMA carrier association writes in the release, which lists 19 carriers by name (and the GSMA) yetlackssome of the big names(e.g. no AT&T and no Verizon, the parent of TechCrunchs parent AOL).In a statement, Googles Nick Fox, VP of communications products at Google, adds: Today marks an important step forward in bringing a better messaging experience for Android users everywhere, and were thrilled to collaborate with our partners across the industry to make this happen.Why has Google been persuaded to lend its brand gloss to the carriers lame duck? We can butspeculate that perhaps it wanted to keep the GSMA happyso it would sanctionanother Android-branded playground landingin the middle of MWC, as has been unveiled today  complete with a free smoothie bar and Android pinbadges that delegates can fight over, as per the last time Googles Android branding took over MWC back in 2011Check out the Android Garden between halls 2 and 3 for goodies.

The features available in SMS havent kept up with modern messaging apps. Rich Communications Services (RCS) is a new standard for carrier messaging and brings many of the features that people now expect from mobile messaging, such as group chats, high res photos and more, said Google at the time of buying Jibe.Also at the time of theJibe acquisition, telecoms analyst Dean Bubley suggested Mountain Viewsmove was actuallyaimedat building its own Android-to-Android iMessage competitor  a theory hes still not ruling out, so perhaps Google still has some hopes on that front.Albeit, Bubley couches Googles latest RCS pronouncement as very lukewarm, noting it has not specified the client will be on all Android devices, for example, even if what is clearlycarrier-written PR talks aboutreaching all Android devices  which would encompasses an awful lot of hardware these days, from phones to smart TVs, to smartwatches and more. (Weve asked Google for some clarity hereand will update this post with any response).Update: A Google spokeswoman said: Once deployed, the Universal RCS Client will come standard for all Android devices globally, providing a more consistent experience with more advanced features. To be clear, thats standard in the sense of OEMs and carriers being able to chooseto install it  so not universal, not mandated by Google and thus most certainly fragmented. (Also on fragmentation thespokeswoman confirmedthat currently the client only works on phones and tablets, so not all Android devices by any means.)Theres also no clear timeframe on when Google will be delivering the RCS client. (The spokeswoman had no concrete commitments to impart here, saying only that Google is planning to launch later this year.) And, as noted above, without ubiquity its going to meanfragmentation keeps RCS-powered messaging apps from building the sought for mass messagingmomentum viathe platform.So those SMS billions Google seemed to be eyeing up last fall, with its Jibe acquisition freshly closed,arent perhaps looking so reachable to it now via the RCS route.Still, its possible Google thinksits still worth a punt on thetech to offeran iMessage alternative  if only for a sub-set of Android handsets.The PR also notes that operators rolling out RCS can deploy their own infrastructure or have the option to use the Jibe Platform from Google, which it notes supports the universal RCS profile.The Jibe Platform includes a hosted cloud for individual operators to launch RCS services for all leading mobile operating systems and the Jibe Hub to interconnect operator RCS networks, the releaseadds.So Google at least gets the chance to cosy up to a few of those listed carriers  and maybeanyresultingrelationships could be usefulto it for some of its other initiatives. After all, Google is actually rebrandedAlphabet nowadays  and it has a business unit for just about every letter of the alphabet. And you can guarantee that all its businesses reap the rewards of increasingconnectivity.Excited to be working w/leading operators & @gsma to fuel open, improved messaging experience with RCS https://t.co/vVhZKpddVl sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 22, 2016
