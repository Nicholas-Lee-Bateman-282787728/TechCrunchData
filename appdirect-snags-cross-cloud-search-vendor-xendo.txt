AppDirect, a company that helps customers manage multiple cloud vendors, announced today it was buying former TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield participant Xendo for an undisclosed amount.Xendo, which launched at TechCrunch Disrupt in September, 2014 enables users to conduct federated searches across cloud services, a function that could prove quiteuseful for AppDirect. In fact, AppDirect CEO DanielSaks says one of the reasons he sought to buy the company is he was using the product on a daily basis.AppDirect has a unique way of incorporating its acquired companies. It lets them continue to operate as before as semi-autonomous entities with the same team, CEO andcustomers, even while incorporating the core functionality into the AppDirectcloud management platform.We bring on motivated tech founders with a great product, plug [their products] into our platform and give them the breadth of out distribution, Saks said.The approachgives the acquired companyaccess to AppDirects resources, while continuing to build the company as before. We wanted to tap into the passion of these founders and keep it going. They continue to operate as CEOs with little hands-on management [from us]. We sawthem asgreat leaders. Were making aninvestment in an independent company, and with our size can help accelerate that vision, Saks explainedThis was one of the primary reasons Xendo was willing to sell so early, according to CEO and co-founder Julian Gay. His companycan continue to build on its ideas, keeping its existing customers, while getting access to a bigger companys engineering and design resources, as well as sales, marketing and other functions a young startup would otherwise needto develop or contract on its own.Xendos conceptextendsfar beyond pure search into a kind of cloud graph of connections across different services. It actually enables a bigger vision, which is yes, at its foundation search, but using access to content as a way to derive insights which are latent in textual content. We want to derive more difficult relationships between people, locations and so forth. Gay told TechCrunch.AppDirect sees this broader vision as a key element as it incorporates Xendos technology into its platform.Xendo customers, which includeNetflix, Looker, Intersection (an Alphabet subsidiary) and AppDirect itself should be pleased because the company will continue to operate as before. Contrast that with Ciscos purchaseof Synata earlier this month in which Cisco simply shut down the company and plans to incorporate the search technology into its Spark communications platform.This is the sixth purchase for AppDirect, which has raised more than $245 million so far. Others includeRadialpoint, AppCarousel, Leftronic, Standing Cloud and jBilling.As for Xendo, its raised just $28,000 in seed money, so it was really early in its development. All 7 Xendo employees will become part of AppDirect.
