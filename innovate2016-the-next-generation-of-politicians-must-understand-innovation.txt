Whats the one certainty about the 2016 election? According to Averell Ace Smith, one of Californias major Democratic party operatives, its that the Democrats will win the election. Ha!But for all Smiths partisan bias, hes got a very interesting take on the upcoming election. Its like the 1890s, he says, because nothing seems to have changed. Politics, Smith told me, is still working off the Hillary Clinton/Jeb Bush model of candidates unwilling to take risks. These pols should take lessons from jugglers, he says. They should learn how to make entertaining mistakes.So where should we look for a new, innovative breed of politician? Smith  who countsKamala Harris, Gavin Newsom and Ed Lee as clients  says that the future lies with Californian politicians. The father of Californian political idiosyncrasy and risk taking is, of course, our current Governor Jerry Brown. But Smith also includes Newsom, Lee and Harris as examples of politicians who are no longer stuck in the mindset of the 1890s. Perhaps, he speculates, thats because they are all very familiar with models of Silicon Valley innovation and entrepreneurship.Many thanks to the San FranciscoiHangarfor hosting this interview with Hilton.
