This week you get TWO AppleCast episodes, because thats just how much Apple news we had thanks to Apples special event on Monday. Weve had a few days now to reflect on the big event, as well as our hands-on experience with both the new MacBook and Apple Watch. In some ways, the intervening time has raised more questions than answers, but Apples latest products are no less exciting for that.We also talk about how polarizing a lot of the response to the new MacBook (which has only a single data port) has been, and how there has also been a lot of apparent rancor for Apples top-tier Apple Watch Edition collection, which starts at $10,000. A lot of people seem to be responding as if Apple were eliminating all other product lines and offering only these options, as my former colleague Tom Reestman nicely summarizes in the tweet below.Quick! Order a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro this week because Monday Apple kills them both AND THERE WILL ONLY BE MACBOOK! MUAHAHAHAHA!!!!

As always, let us know if theres something youd specifically like us to cover.Direct download available here, or find us on iTunes and SoundCloud.
