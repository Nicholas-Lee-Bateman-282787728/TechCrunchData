When Kevin Lynch, Apples VP of technology demonstrated how apps worked on the Apple Watch today, he showed some cool examples such asordering an Uber and checking in to your hotel from the Watch, but he alsoincluded a quick peek at an appfrom Salesforce.It was the only truly enterprise app for the Watch that Appleshowedtoday.Lynchshowed how a person might use the Watch at work, and it definitely has utility strictly as an at-a-glance calendar and quick communications tool, but healso showed a graph from Salesforce Wave, the analytics package Salesforce released last fall at Dreamforce.Michael Peachey, VP of solutions and product marketing at Salesforce says he believes Apple has come up with another winner, one in which enterprise apps could play a key role, whether interacting with customers, partners or fellow employees.I think clearly Apple Watch is going to be a transformational moment in the industry, he said, adding Other vendors have tried it, but Appleis really cracking the code.Peachey believes that while Apple has nailed the hardware, its really the apps that are going to be the difference maker here, but in a fundamentally different way than we use our computers, tablets and phones. Whereas you might interact with your phone several minutes at a time and your computer for hours at a time, you are going to use your Watch for seconds at a time and the software really needs to be tuned to take that into account.Salesforce wanted to be a part of the wearables revolution and even launched a Wearables SDK last June. Today they released three products designed specifically to work on the Watch.First of all, there is the previously mentioned Salesforce Wave for Apple Watch. This provides an at-a-glance view of important information you want to be notified about. He acknowledges that this is not about detailed analysis, but getting key data when it matters. If you want more, you are going to go to your phone or tablet on the road (or your computerin the office).The second piece is Salesforce1 for Apple Watch which provides quick access to the entire range of Salesforce information including sales, service, marketing and employee community. For instance, a sales manager might get an alert when a discount is required on deal and a marketer might get an alert when a campaign reaches itspipeline goal.The final piece is Salesforce Wear for Apple Watch, which is an SDK to help Salesforce customers build applications on the Salesforce platform to work on the Apple Watch.Peachey also sees a big role for the Watch in marketing directly to consumers. He believes when used correctly, businessescould use the Watch as an avenue to communicate directly with customers.Marketers will have to tread carefully in this regard though because they dont want to overwhelm Watch users with promotions or the device could very quickly become unbearable.But thats true of all notifications, regardless of thetype. Its not about delivering more and more notifications, he said. You can be nudged when something important in business happens, and very quickly see what happened.Peachey says while Salesforce made a conscious decision to get in early, he sees the wearables market in general and the Apple Watch in particular as an area thats going to explodeover the next several yearsThat also means, IT needs to start thinking about a new screen size and a new paradigm on top of mobile, social and cloud. Salesforce hopes to help its customers get going quickly.Industry and people will realize, the personal and instant way you get updated on something important. You just get nudged, see just a snippet at the time and take action, Peachey said.
