Snapchat is famous for its disappearing messages, but unfortunately not everything in this world is ephemeral when you need it to be. The L.A.-based company disclosedtoday thata number of its current and former employees had their identities compromised bya cyberattackthis month.Last Friday, Snapchats payroll department was targeted by an isolated email phishing scam in which a scammer impersonated our Chief Executive Officer and asked for employee payroll information, Snapchat explained in a blog post. Unfortunately, the phishing email wasnt recognized for what it was  a scam and payroll information about some current and former employees was disclosed externally.Snapchat has had hacking problems in the past.The service leaked some 200,000 photos from users back in 2014 when unofficial third-party apps were compromised, but on this occasion the circumstances and outcome are different. For one thing, Snapchat said that no user data was affected, while the company is shouldering the blame for the issue. (Last time it said users who lost data were at fault for using unofficial accounts; it then subsequently nixed all third party access to its platformin the name of security.)So what was accessed this time around? Snapchat isnt being too specific  this is sensitive  but payrollinformation could includesalary data, Social Security numbers, bank details, addresses, emails and other personal ID which, in the hands of the wrong people, could create headaches for those affected.Corporate hacking and information theft has occupied the limelight regularly in recent years. The scale of the hack on Sony, which also took place in 2014, was unprecedented and, beyond putting confidential company information (including, ironically, details about Snapchats business) into the public forum, it also exposed the personal information and databelongingto thousands upon thousands of Sony staff.Snapchat said it is impossibly sorry for this breach. It vowed to redouble our already rigorous training programs around privacy and security in the hope of preventing future incidents like this happening again.
