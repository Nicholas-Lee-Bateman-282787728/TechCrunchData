Think of Anki Overdrive as slot cars for the smartphone age. With upgrades, achievements and characters, its a perfect marriage of smartphones with physical toys. The system debuted two years ago and the company has steadily upgraded the system since. But today, the company revealed the ship date and price of its next generation product, Anki Overdrive.Anki debuted the Overdrive track system earlier this year. Unlike the original system which was a massive mat, Overdrive features individual track sections similar to the slot car tracks of old. This system allows for endless track layouts and even more fun than the original.This system will start shipping in the US, UK and Germany on September 20. The $150 starter pack will include two cars and ten pieces of track. Additional track sections can be purchased separately. The company also announced six new cars today, each with different traits and abilities.At $150 Anki Overdrive is about twice the price of a modest slot car track. But with Anki, unlike normal slot cars, as players earn points and achievements, the cars become faster, more agile and better. The cars get physically faster. Its a rad system and worth the price of admission.
