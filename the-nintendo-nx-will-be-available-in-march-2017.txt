Nintendo forecasts disappointing profits over the next year. Thats why the company used its earnings report to share some news about Nintendos future to reassure investors. As expected, the companys next console is coming soon. But you wont be able to play it during the holidays as Nintendo plans a global launch for March 2017.And thats about all we know. One more thing, the next Zelda game is going to be released simultaneously on the Wii U and Nintendo NX (or whatever its called) as a launch title for the new gaming system.Nintendo has been saying that the NX is a brand new thing. And rumor has it that the NX is going to replace both the Wii U and the 3DS. The console would come with a gamepad that you could use as a portable console when youre not in front of your TV.It would make sense as both the Wii U and the 3DS need a successor. The Wii U is now selling poorly, well behind Sonys Playstation 4 and Microsofts Xbox One. Third-party game developers are also focusing more on Microsofts and Sonys platforms, as well as the PC.The 3DS has been successful, but was also launched five years ago  and sales are slipping. Five years ago, smartphones were very different. Now, smartphones are capable devices and many people are playing games on their phones. Sure, you wont find Mario Kart and generous RPG games on your phone, but players are still spending a lot of time playing freemium games on their phones.The idea that you want another portable device to play games in addition to your phone seems dated. Nintendo knows it, and its going to be interesting to see whether the company can convince old fans as well as kids who have grown up with Minecraft and iPads that they need an NX.Are we going to see the NX at E3 in June? It seems unlikely that Nintendo will showcase the NX well before its launch. Nintendo is still selling the 3DS and Wii U after all. And the NX is a big deal, Nintendo doesnt need an industry event to catch everyones attention.
