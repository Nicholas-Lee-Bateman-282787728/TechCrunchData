There is Oku.This little sensor can see through your skin to give you advice on skin care and can even tell you when your pimples are about to settle down and disappear. It costs $299 and connects to an iPhone app to assess your skin health.The product has been in development for a year or so and started out as a much bigger device that could look at and analyze skin spots and the like. Now its a little bite more compact and quite cute.You can pre-order it here and it ships this year.
