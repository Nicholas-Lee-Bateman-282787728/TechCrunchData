Chinas Internet giant Tencent has beenexpanding its international reach in areas like games and advertising, and as part of that, the company is picking up its dealmaking in Europe. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the owner of the popular WeChat messaging platform is in early talks to buy a majority stake in Supercell  the mobile gaming phenomenon based out of Finland that is behind Clash of Clans  from current majority shareholder Softbank.On top of this,in the coming weeks, TechCrunch has learned that Tencent plans to announcemarketing and advertising partnerships with French ad giant Publicis and luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.Tencent, Softbank and Supercell are not commenting on the WSJ story. In response to our questions they respectively responded with similar wording: We decline to comment on market rumours, We decline to comment on speculation, andWe dont comment on market rumors or speculation.Supercells valuation last yearwasbelieved to be over $5 billion.The other two partnerships areexpected to be revealed at different events in France in June. LVMH is expected to announcea joint business partnership with Tencent during the Cannes Lions media conference that month.The Publicis agreement will see Tencent become a global media partner to the ad company, with the news going publicduring Viva Technology, a conferenceorganised by Publicis and Les Echos, at the end of June.Buying astake in Supercell would give Tencent a largerfoothold into the mobile games market, and provide it with a complement to games that derive revenues from ads or paid downloads. Tencents other holdings in games includeGlu Mobile (14.6%), League of Legends maker Riot Games (full control as of December 2015), and Miniclip, which was Tencents first gaming investment in Europe (undisclosed percentage, made in February 2015).A deal with Tencentcould also prove to be a big boost to Supercell in China. Supercell has always been free and makes money through in-app purchases of in-game extras, That business posted earnings (Ebitda) of 848 million on revenues of 2.11 billion in 2015. Tencent, meanwhile, is building out a largepayments business, which already holds some200 million payment cards in its database: giving people a seamless integration to make in-app purchases in Supercell couldlead to a big boom for the business in the country.But its a not a certainty that a deal will go through. The WSJ notes that conversations between Tencent and Softbank are atan early stage, and there might be others interested in acquiring its Supercell stake, such as Tencent rival Alibaba (which counts Softbank as an investor) partnering withGiant Interactive.Or it might not sell at all: the WSJ notes that selling Supercell is part of a wider strategy from Softbank to review its games portfolio, but as with the Supercell story,Softbank has not commented on this, either.Softbank made its initial investment in Supercell in 2013, taking a 51% stake for $1.53 billion in a partnership with GungHo. Then in June, 2015, Softbank upped its stake to 73% and became its sole external shareholder (the original founders and Supercell keeping the rest). Through all of this,Supercell has been guaranteed complete autonomy under Softbank, so it would be interesting to see whether any ownership shift to another strategic buyer would keep Supercells existing business model in place. That, too, could end up being a deciding factor in a deal.Whether or not ads ever make their way to properties that are decided ad-free today, Tencents bigger business  which is largely based in China and includes not only WeChat, but the popular QQ Internet portal and IM messaging service, games, payments and more  has a large advertising component. Tencentsleading position in digital services makes it an attractive partner for companies that want to grow their business in that market. Its not clear what Tencent would do with Publicis, but as one template, it already works with companies like Dentsu and WPP to help expand their reach and dataset in China.As for LVMH, its not clear if a dealwould be focused just on advertising on Tencent properties or something more involved, since Tencent does have other holdings in fashion. Most notably,in January itmerged its online fashion portal Meilishuo with rival Mogujie to create a company valued at $3 billion.
