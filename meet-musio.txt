Natural language and machine learning company AKA says its taking the next step toward the creation of a robot that you can really, truly talk to, with a new project called Musio.Members of the AKA team demonstrated an Android-based prototype for me last week. As you can see in the video, Musio should be able to carry on a normal conversation, complete with bad jokes and (thanks to Bluetooth connections to smart devices) magic tricks. Why would you want that? Well, besides the novelty and fun of having a talking robot, it could be useful for practicing English and other learning activities, and for controlling smart home devices.AKA is crowdfunding Musio on Indiegogo. (The campaign page also offers a little more detail about the underlying technology.) The company aims to raise at least $50,000, with pricing starting at $99 for a simple brain version of the robot.
