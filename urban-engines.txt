As a part-timeurban planning nerd, Ilove visualizations of buses, trains and cars pulsating throughcities.Nowwith more dataavailablethrough smartphones, emergent logistics platforms like Uber and eventually Internet-connected and self-driving cars, its inevitable that softwarewillbecome indispensable inmanagingand making masstransit more efficient.Thats the bet of a Silicon Valley-based startup called Urban Engines that was founded by some very,very longtime former Googlers and a Stanfordcomputerscience professor namedBalaji Prabhakar.Initially, they built out software to help cities like Singapore and Sao Paulo manage theirpublic transit systems.But now theyre moving forward with aconsumer-mapping app that works quickly when youre offline.Why, might you ask, would you need an additional mapping app whenGoogle already provides one?Well, Urban Engines appdoesnt rely on mobileInternet when youre underground in the subwayand it also has a few UI flourishes that make the experience faster than the regular Google Maps app. For one, when you boot it up, youdont have to type in a destination; you can just dragthe center of the map to wherever youre going and it will generate different routes for you automatically.Urban Engines has created offlinemapsfor 10 different cities in North America, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Toronto, Vancouver and Washington, D.C.Theres also an X-ray mode that overlays a map over the streets andhelps you figure out where youre going.Doing this is harder than it sounds. The 30-person company, which is backed by an undisclosed amount of funding fromEric Schmidt, Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Ram Shriram, SV Angel and others, has put together its mapping solution from OpenStreetMaps and other sources for public transit data. Theyre competing against the 3,000 people who work on Google Maps.What weve been doing is collectingmovement data from connected cars, connected buses, and connected trains, saidPrabhakar. Commuting today is multi-modal. You have to puttogether thisjigsaw puzzle of mobility from many different sources.
