This is because the California Public Utilities Commission classifies Uber, Lyft and other ridesharing services astransportation network companies, separating them from taxi services and imposing a separate transportation fee of $3.85 to transport customers.PassengerVamsi Tadepalli, who initiated the class action lawsuit, accused Uber of fraudulently charging him a higher $4 fee in late November 2015, and of letting drivers keep the fee instead of passing it onto SFO, where the fee was intended to go.According to the suit, Tadepalli said Uber told him the fee would be used to reimburse drivers who were charged SFOs transportation network company fee. But according to the lawsuit, Uber was charging the fee earlier than the airport started requiring payment.Uber charged Tadepalli the fee in July 2015; SFO didnt start charging drivers atransportation fee until November 2015.The lawsuit alleges customers were improperly charged an airport transportation fee between June 1, 2010, and November 20, 2015. None of these fees were reimbursed to the airport but were kept by drivers, according to the suit.The suit also accuses Uber of excessively charging passengers by rounding up to $4 instead of the $3.85 fee.Although, SFO announced that in the future it will charge Uber $3.85 to pick up and drop off passengers  Ubers $4.00 SFO Airport Fee Toll will be excessive and result in customers paying more than they should pay under the circumstances, the class action lawsuit stated.Not everyone using the Uber app within that timeframe may have received an email notification of the settlement. However, tens of thousands of passengers may have been affectedAccording to the lawsuit, Uber denies any wrongdoing and maintains it stayed within the law. Weve reached out to Uber for comment and will update this post as soon as we hear back.The case is still pending.
