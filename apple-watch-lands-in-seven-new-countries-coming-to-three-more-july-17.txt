The Apple Watch is expanding beyond the launch group of countries today, shortly after the device first became available for in-store purchase at Apple Retail with a reservation. The international sales expansion includes Italy, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan as of today, and the next group includes the Netherlands, Sweden and Thailand starting July 17.Heres what todays international sales debut looked like on the ground at Apple Stores around the world, via photos supplied by the company. My personal favorite is the one with the dog shopping companion:Apples retail rollout of Watch has been slow, with initial sales restricted only to online orders. The device seems to have been severely supply constrained at launch, but Apple is catching up to demand, enabling both in-store sales and the addition of new countries to the list of places where its available.
