At todays Apple event in San Francisco, VP Kevin Lynch ran through what itll be like to call anUber from your wrist.When you open the Uber app on your Apple Watch, it goes straight to a screen showing how long itll be until a car can come get you  no pulling out your phone to drop pins or choose between Uber X, Uber Pool, or black car service.Once youve given that big button a tap, the app confirms that its looking for a ride and shows where it thinksyou want to be picked up, giving you a chance to cancel if your phone sent the wrong location data.Once youve got the car confirmed, you can watch its arrival progressvia a tiny map as well as double-check the drivers face and car from a single screen:As TechCrunch co-editor Matt Panzarino wrote on Friday, the Apple Watch is about reducing the time you spend on your phone by simplifying most of the steps we think of as normal today. As Uber and the other apps shown today demonstrate, that means cutting away the structure of apps and leaving the actual actions  liking posts, sending quick messages and ordering your ride.
