Get ready for a lot more ads on Instagram and elsewhere that feel ever more personalised to you. Instagram today is turning up the volume on its ad tech play, courtesy of its owner, Facebook. Today the photo-and video-based social network is adding Dynamic Ads a retargeting unit that Facebook launched on its own network a little over a year ago(under a slightly different name)that is essentiallyadvertising that is customised to you: showingproducts that you are more likely to buy based on your online activity and interests.Alongside this, Facebook is also rolling out two other ad tech developments:aDynamic Adunit specifically for the travel sector; andmoredetails to its lookalike custom audiences so that web sites using the tool can prioritize types of users, because some website visitors are more valuable to a business than others, according to Facebook.The two refinements and adding Dynamic Ads to Instagram underscores how Facebook is continuing to capitalise onits ever-growing user base  now at 1.65 billion users  and the data that it is able to amass from them. Advertisingaccounts for nearly all of Facebooks revenues, which last quarter was just under $5.4 billion.Facebook says that one of the key reasons its expanding the ad units is specifically to address its mobile users. Mobile accounted for 82% of Facebooks revenues in the last quarter (working out to 79% of all ad revenues), and its range of apps (including Facebook and Instagram) are part of the wider trend of app usage. Research from eMarketer says that 85% of all time on smartphones is spent in apps, with 85% on average on just five favorite apps.Facebook itself is also trying not just to capitalise on the data that it has about users, but on the data that its collecting from advertisers, too: Facebook says that a whopping 2.5 billion products have been uploaded to Facebook and up to now some 440 million people have viewed products in Dynamic Ads in just the last three months.(This also brings up another thought: this is a very clear sign of how Facebook hopes to use Instagram to compete for the same ad dollars as Pinterest.)Being an image-based network, Instagram is an obvious platform for extending these Dynamic Ads: shoppers on Instagram  that is, people who actively browse retailers sites and search for products  visit Instagram 6 days out of every 7 and are way more active on the service overall, using it twice as much as non-consumer minded users. Moreover, Facebook said that a recent user survey it conducted found that 75% take action on a website, which might beshopping for a product or searching for more information, after seeing it on Instagram.Its for reasons like thesethat Facebook thinks that there is a very ripe opportunity to do more retargeting for this audience.In a similar vein, Facebooks sharper focus on travel is trying to account for more of the data that can be gleaned about a persons specific travel intent: this is not only something that Facebook can figure out, but is something that, used correctly, will make the ad more effective. In this case, Facebook will now add location and travel date data into the mix.Dynamic Ads for travel empower travel advertisers to offer hotel options to people who have shown interest in taking a trip, either by browsing hotels or searching and purchasing a flight, Facebook notes. For example, a travel business can connect with people who viewed a hotel on their website by showing them an ad featuring the hotel they viewed along with similar hotels in the area. It will also extend to products beyond the one that a user is browsing for: one example are hotels that you might see in ads after youve booked a flight.The last of these  Custom Audiences  is a development on the lookalike product that Facebook hashad in place since 2013 but has done little to update in the interim. The main idea here is to add more prioritization into the mix. The new options address the fact that some website visitors are more valuable to a business than others, Facebook says simply. This could be a stronger focus on specific kinds of marketing for people who are frequent versus infrequent site visitors, or those who are spending a lot of money on a site. Facebook tells me that an advertiser can set up a campaign to reach the people who visited their site, or they can use the list of people who visited their site to run a lookalike campaign on Facebook.
