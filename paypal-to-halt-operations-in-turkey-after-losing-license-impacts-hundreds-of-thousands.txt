Turkey has been making moves to bring tech business in the country under more localised control,and todaybig U.S. online payments company PayPal became the latest casualty. The company announced that it is suspending business operations in Turkey effective June 6, after failing to obtain a new license for its services.The closure, PayPal told TechCrunch, will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers.A spokesperson confirmed the closure and also the reason behind it in two separate statements to TechCrunch.The first statement closely follows the messagein Turkish on PayPals local site regarding the denial of a license from the financial regulator BDDK.We are sorry to announcethatPayPal issuspendingitsbusiness operations in Turkey, the company noted in a written note. Effectivefrom June 6, 2016, our customers in Turkeywillno longerbeable to send or receive funds with PayPal. Customers willstillbeable to log in to their PayPal accounts and withdraw any balance on their accountsto a Turkish bank account.Supporting our customers is very important to PayPal. However,we have no choicebuttosuspendprocessingpayments in Turkeyas our application for a Turkish payments license has been denied by the local financial regulator and we have been instructed to suspend our Turkish business operations.Asked why the license was denied, the spokesperson saidthat it was a resultof new rules that require IT systems to be localized in the country. PayPal distributes its IT across several global hubs.Our suspension of services is a result of new national regulations overseen by the BDDK that require PayPal to fully localize our information technology systems in Turkey, the spokesperson said. We respect Turkeys desire to have information technology infrastructure deployed within its borders, however, PayPal utilizes a global payments platform that operates across more than 200 markets, rather than maintaining local payments platforms with dedicated technology infrastructure in any single country.Its not clear how many data centers PayPal  which split from parent eBay in 2015 and is valued at $46 billion  has globally, or which hub handles its Turkish business. We have asked the company and will update as we learn more.Turkey has been in the tech spotlight in recent months, but not for particularlypositive reasons. In April, personal data for some 50 million Turkish citizens (more than half of its population of 80 million) was leaked online, seemingly by an activist (or activists) who were releasing the datato highlight the countrys ageing IT infrastructure, blaming the problem on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his tech policies.Its not all about tech, of course.Turkeyhas been a target for terrorist attacks, and that appearsto be at least one reason thatsome believe Erdogan is justified in his iron fist approach.Erdogans government has been trying to exert more power on the tech sphere than his predecessors, and one area where that has been very apparent up to now has been in social media: sites like Twitter, Facebook and Redditin connection with a censorship law in the country that gives the regulator permission to block sites if they host content related to, among other things, porn, drugs, terrorism, illegal file sharing, or anything negative/questionable related toMustafa Atatrk, the first president of Turkey.Twitter has gone so far as to file a lawsuit in the country protesting the fine its been asked to pay oversome of the tweets it has refused to remove.Well continue to monitor this story and see how and if other companiesare being affected. Onelocal competitor, Iyzico, is stillonline.
