Boy, am I excited!The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off is coming to the greatest place in the world: Brooklyn, New York.I live in Brooklyn, and travel all over the country to visit cities with awesome startups. Now, Im happy to announce that you guys are finally coming to me.The Brooklyn TC Meetup will go down on March 1 at 6pm ET at Output, a pretty happening bar with a cool outdoor space (for those of you that enjoy freezing weather).As is standard with these things, were looking for ten companies who have the chops to pitch their wares in sixty seconds or less on stage. A panel of judges (with the help of a loving audience) will determine the winners.First place gets a table in Startup Alley at Disrupt NY in May. Second place gets two tickets to the conference and the Audience Choice winner gets one ticket to the big show.We always have fun at these events, and given that were going to be in BK, I cant imagine anything but a blast.Apply here to participate in the Pitch-Off.Applications close on Friday, so dont tarry.But if you just want to go to the event (shake some hands, have a few drinks, and make a few new friends), now is the time to buy tickets. We humbly ask that you are at least 21 years of age.Buy tickets to the Brooklyn Meetup here.See you guys soon!Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
