Shares in technology companies have recently come under intense pressure, similar to otherequities, markets, commodities and more. How far tech shops have declined, however, is worth digging into. After all, if the value of public tech companies has declined sharply, it could impact the value of private startups like Uber or Dropbox.I picked a few dozen public tech companies that youve heard of and placed them into three groups: Recent IPOs, Adolescents, and Where Your Parents Worked.Each category is sorted by percent decline in share value for a company, compared to its 52-week high.All data is via Google Finance, and WolframAlpha was kind enough to divide for us all.

Lets see what China does in a few hours.
