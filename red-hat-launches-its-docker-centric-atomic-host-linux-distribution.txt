Almost a year ago, Red Hat announced its plans to launch a Docker-centric version of its Enterprise Linux distribution and after a long beta, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Atomic Hostis now generally available.With Atomic Host, Red Hat is throwing its hatinto the Docker ring and joining the likes of CoreOS in the enterprise container OS space.Project Atomic, which forms the basis of this distribution, is a Red Hat-sponsored project for developing a relatively lean operating system thats designed to run Docker containers. In this respect, its a bit like Canonicals variousSnappy editionsUbuntu Core, which also focus on giving users a basic but secure base operating system for their container deployments.The technologies at the core of Project Atomic are Docker, as well as Googles Kubernetes container orchestrationtools, rpm-ostreefor managing updates (and rollbacks), and the systemdLinux system and services manager.Red Hat, just like other OS vendors, agrees that the traditional monolithic technology stack is quickly giving way to microservices  andcontainers are ideally suited for this kind of work. The company stresses that Atomic Host includes all the security features ofRed Hat Enterprise Linux and notes that it will inherit the ecosystem of certified partners that currently support its Enterprise Linux distribution. This partner ecosystem, the company argues, means itll be easyto move containers between different clouds and hypervisors, including VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V, Amazon Web Services and Googles Cloud Platform.One of the areas Red Hat especially focused on with Atomic Host is security and lifecycle management. Atomic Host will feature automatic, image-based updates. These can be deployed in a single step and  if something goes wrong  its easy to roll back the update, too.Atomic Hostallows developers to easilypackage their Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 applications and deploy them in containers. This should make it relatively easy for existing Red Hat users to give Atomic Host a try.
