While Google shows off its latest developments at the I/O event in California, theres been another development in the ongoing legal fallout from the 2014 Right to be Forgotten ruling in Europe.Today, Google saidthat it hasfiled an appeal in FrancesSupreme Administrative Court, the Conseil dEtat, in opposition toa new, expanded order from the French data protection regulator (CNIL): the CNILwants RTBF requests and delistings to apply tosearches globally, not just in domains viewed in a persons home country.The announcement of the appeal was made originally in an opinion piece penned by Kent Walker, Googles global general counsel, and published today in Frances LeMonde newspaper, where he also revealed that Google now reviewedalmost1.5 million webpages and delisted around 40% of them across Europe. Google subsequently published an English version of Walkers op-ed on its own blog.Googlesappeal comes on the heels of the search giantgetting fined $112,000 in Marchafter the CNIL decidedthat the current RTBF implementation  which removes links across all Google domains within the individuals country in the EU  was not strong enough, and that it should be applied globally.Only a measure that applies to app processing by the search engine, with no distinction between the extensions used and the geographical location of the Internet user making a search, is legally adequate to meet the requirement for protection as ruled by the Court of Justice of the European Union, said the CNIL statement. The CJEU is the body that made the original RTBF ruling.Up to now, the main argument from Google and others against RTBF requests is that they could be used to restrict the free flow of information  something that Google has said its against on principle, but more pointedly also could undermine the companys wider business model.As a matter of both law and principle, we disagree with this demand, he writes. We comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. But if French law applies globally, how long will it be until other countries  perhaps less open and democratic  start demanding that their laws regulating information likewise have global reach? This order could lead to a global race to the bottom, harming access to information that is perfectly lawful to view in ones own countryWe have received demands from governments to remove content globally on various grounds  and we have resisted, even if that has sometimes led to the blocking of our services.On one hand, its unsurprising to see Google opposing CNIL in this case: as the French regulator has tried to widen the scope of RTBF before, Google has appealed those paststages  and lost.Losing or winning a case in one country has a wider legal precedent for Google,as it will apply across the whole of the EU.While there is definitely an argument to be made about the sanctity of international law, the question will be whether its fair to say that expanding RTBF globally is an accurate example of how this is being violated.For one thing, given how international and borderless the Internet is, restricting where RTBF is being applied by geography seems like an ineffectual way of addressing a persons right to privacy.Similarly, its worth remembering that RTBF delisting doesnt remove pages from the Internet or search engine results altogether. What they do is remove the ability to find those pages by searching on the specific names of individuals that have requested the results to be removed.The next step in the battle will see the French court reviewing the case again in coming months.
