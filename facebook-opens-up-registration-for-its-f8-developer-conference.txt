Each year, Facebook holds a big ol developer conference where itannounces a few new products, host a bunch of sessions for developers to learn how to work with the various products under Facebooks watch (WhatsApp, Oculus, Facebook itself, etc.), and everyone drinks a little too much under the guise of networking.At last years show, the company announced itsplans to make Messenger a platform for developers, support for spherical videos in the newsfeed, and support for embeddable videos. Italso announced that Parse was moving into the Internet of Things realm.. which, of course, no longer matters because it hassince killed Parse.This years F8 will happen on April 12th and 13th. Looking to get a seat this year? Good news! Registration just opened up  but theres a bit of a catch.This isnt a first come, first served kind of deal. If you want to go and werent invited by Facebook, youll have to apply for a ticket, explaining why you want to go, what you do for a living, etc. If Facebook decides youre up to snuff, the tickets will cost $595 a pop  about two-thirds of the cost of a ticket to Google I/O and around one-third the price of a ticket to Apples WWDC, for reference.The registration site is now live right over here.If you dont get in, dont sweat it too hard: As always, Facebook will be streaming most of the show.
