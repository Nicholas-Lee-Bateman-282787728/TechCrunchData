So Facebook did something new with notifications. That little tab plagued by a tireless numeric red badgethat led to an endless feed of social happenings is getting a much-needed upgrade that really heightens its utility.The notifications tab is now more of a you-centric newsfeed than ever, sucking in some of the best widgets from the Facebook sidebar on desktop and giving notifications on mobile a much more structured appearance.In look and feel Facebooks notifications tab now feels a lot more like a Google Now competitor.The groupings of notifications, similarlycalled cards,give the feed some much-needed content and UI/UX upgrades.You can enablecards for itemslike Events or Birthdays, as well as new widgetslike sports scores ortonights TV programming.If users have Location History enabled in the app, youll be able to get the most out of the tab and add a lot of interesting cards that are hyper-localized.The blog post detailed a few of the location-aware cards that willbe available to users:Also notable is that Facebooks Trending news topics now has a much better place to live on mobile. Rather than being hiddenin Search, trending news stories now have their own card in notifications.Thankfully, users wont be receiving any more red badge notification than usual within the app unless they specify to do so. Each card will include its ownnotifications settings.A customizable notifications feed is an interestingstep for Facebook. Previously customization in the FB app, whether in regards to notifications or privacy, has focused more on checkboxes of what is and what is notincluded. Here Facebook is actually allowing users to arrange cardsin a hierarchical way based on their preferences.These changes will be gradually rolling out to iOS and Android users.
