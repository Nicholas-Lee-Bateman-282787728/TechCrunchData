HopSkipDrive, The LA-based Uber for Kids, has closed a $10.2M Series A round co-led by FirstMark Capital and UpFront Ventures, withparticipation from existing investors BBG Ventures and 1776, and new investors Greycroft Partners and Pritzker Group Venture Capital.The company also announced thatit has hiredEyal Gutentag as COO, who previously was general manager of Ubers Los Angeles operations.As a refresher, HopSkipDrive lets parentspre-schedule pick-up times for their kids with trusted, thoroughly vetted drivers to shuttle them between school or activities.This vetting includesextensive background checks, vehicle inspection, fingerprinting, participation in ongoing DMV checks, and in-person meeting with the drivers.The company, whichhas already raised $3.9M in seed funding, will use the new cash to continue expanding beyond LA, as well as strengthentheir product development team.But while the company has setits sights on expansion, how is HopSkipDrivefaring in itshometown of LA? Cofounder Joanna McFarlandexplained that the majority of the thousands of families using the service in LA are using it several times a week. And, the top 25 percent of customers are using the service several times a day.This retention rate is pretty impressive, and shows that HopSkipDrives service offerings have become an essential part of many LA-based families daily routine.But with HopSkipDrives driversbeing so well-vetted, will there be any worry of parents starting to circumnavigate HopSkipDrive and begin hiring caretakersoutside of the platform?McFarland says no, mainly because the majority of HopSkipDrives users are parents who only need 30 minutes to an hour of driving each day. If parentswere to hire a caretakeroutside of the platform, they would probably have to take them on as a part or full-time nanny.Essentially, McFarland thinks that the value proposition of HopSkipDrive is unique enough that parents would rather use the service than hire outside the platform.When asked about eventual plans to offer other services,McFarland said that they see potential uses cases where other groups (like seniors or people with special needs) could benefit from HopSkipDrives secure ride share platform.But for now, the company is hyper-focused on geographical expansion of their tried and true model of child-transportation.
