If youve every tried to crop a photo (and in the age of Instagram, who hasnt?) or simply adjust the horizon line, you knowhow hard it can be to find just the right crop that allows you to focus on what you want to highlight in a picture without cutting other important parts out of it or leaving you with white edges.If youre a Photoshop user, you may soon have to maker fewer trade-offs when cropping images.Adobe is bringing the same technology that already powers its content-aware fill, move patch to photo cropping, too.Instead of having to cut out too much of an image or ending up withlots of empty white space when you need to rotate it a little bit, Photoshop will soon be able toautomatically fill in those spaces instead. Photoshops algorithms will simply look at what should be around the edges of the photo and then try to fill them in seamlessly.Just like with Photoshops other content-aware tools, this will probably work best for relatively basic structures (or the sky), but how well it really works in practice obviously remains to be seen.For now,all Adobe is giving us is a sneak peek of this new feature, though. All the company is willing to say about when this tool will arrive in Photoshop CC is that it will be part of an upcoming major release.
