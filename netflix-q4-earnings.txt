Netflix just released its fourth quarter earnings report,sending the stock up more than 8 percent (as of 4:35 p.m. Eastern) in after-hours trading.The company reported revenue of $1.82 billion, up from $1.48 billionduringthe same quarter last year, and earnings per share of 10 cents. Analysts had been predicting revenue of $1.83 billion and EPS of 2 cents. So thats a very slight miss on revenue but a big win on earnings/profitability(apparently a big goal for 2016).Looking beyond Q4, the company has announcedthat itsexpanding into 130 newcountries(justnot China), which is probably why its predicting growth of 6 million members this quarter.The Q4 investor letter also discusses Netflixs continuing efforts to produce itsown TV shows and movies, saying it plans to release 600 hours of original content this year, up from 450 hours in 2015. And it says, tongue presumably in cheek:The growth of Netflix has created some anxiety among TV networks and calls to be fearful. Or, at the other extreme, an NBC executive recently said Internet TV is overblown and that linear TV is TV like God intended. Our investors are not as sure of Gods intentions for TV, and instead think that Internet TV is a fundamentally better entertainment experience that will gain share for many years. The challenge for traditional media companies, most of whom see the future pretty clearly, is to use the revenue from Netflix and other SVOD services to fund both great content and their own evolution into Internet TV networks. Seeso, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, CanalPlay, HBO Now, and CBS All Access are the beginnings of these efforts.
