Q: What do you get if you cross seasoned psychological cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)techniques with modern app design? A:Moodnotes: aka the lovechild ofLondon-based digital product studio ustwo maker of minimalist mobile gameMonument Valley, among other apps plus LA-based m-health app maker Thriveport.Moodnotes is a health journal for youto capture yourfeelings and improve your thinking habits, saysAlana Wood, ustwo UX designer. It couples positive psychology with CBT and off the back of logging your mood it acts as a catalyst to get you into journaling and then its through the journaling that we tailor the content, in quite a simple way,whether your mood is more up or down to prompt users to think more in depth about the situations that theyre facing and how theyre feeling and thinking whilst theyre in those situations.The other half of this joint venture, Thriveport,was set up by a pair of U.S. psychologists with the aim of building scientifically sound apps for theemergent m-health space. Their first app, MoodKit, has been in the market since 2011. And hasgained users fromthe mainstream, as well as attracting utilityas a tool clinical psychologists recommend their patients use, according to co-founder Edrick Dorian  althoughhe wont disclose exact user numbers, saying only that its in the tens of thousands and demand for the app has held steady for the past four years.Moodnotes,launching today on iOS(iPhone and Apple Watch) also as a paid app (costing $3.99/2.99), extends Thriveports reach into the m-health app spacewith a second iOSapp focused on promoting emotional and mental wellbeing, but this time incorporatingthe interface and UX design pedigree of ustwo via a partnership thats initially agreed to runfor two-years.Moodnotes is an intentionally more streamlined experiencethan MoodKit, says Dorian(he describes the latter as a Swiss Army Knife of mental health tools),with a more fixedfocus on mood tracking and journaling as a way to help users understand and modify their thought processes with the aim ofpromoting general emotional wellbeing.Its being launched as an MVP at this stage after eight weeks dev time (with no iCloud integration as yet, for instance), andcontent and feature-set aligned with its$3.99/2.99 price-tag  allowing the team to get an app launchedwithin a tight delivery timeframe, test the market, and then iterate based on future usage, says ustwos business director Nicki Sprinz.We put together the maximum content that suits that price point that people feel they are getting value but theres enough revenue for us to be able to support the maintenance, growth and design of the platform, she says, explaining why theyve steered clear of a subscription model at this point.Moodnoteshas a playful interface that letsusers quickly log their mood by swiping up or down on a face to move from neutral to happy or sad. From there they can do a quick save and leave it at that if they just want to do mood tracking. Or theres a button to tap to add more details  at which point the appprompts them to start journaling to flesh out the feelings behind the mood they just recorded, including the ability to tag entries with positive or negative feelings (such as anxious or content).Depending on how much time or motivation the user has, they can progressively go deeper with their journaling practice. And we thought to frame it as a tangible journal was quite important because its a social norm, journaling, so essentially we wanted to also get around this kind of stigma associated with mental health and focus it on emotional health and just simply the act of journaling, saysWood.The flow of the app changes depending on the emotions the user expresses  so if they start tagging their day with more negative emotions they will unlock different prompts than if they are expressing positive feelings.Depending on if youre feeling low then it will start to bring in that CBT content to help you to unpack in more detail how you were thinking and approaching the situation  and then it will kind of give you an antidote in terms of how to think about things differently for the future and what to look out for, says Wood.But then if youre feeling more positive then what we found through testing is when people are in a more uplifting mood they dont want to spend too much time in analysis. So then we limit the questions simply to more positive psychology type of questions around the kind of gratitude journaling, and that kind of thing.The app also charts mood logging so users can get an overview of their emotional state over time.Its quite interesting because it has a lot of versatility around it. Its simply a facilitation experience, and so people make from it what they put into it,sheadds.Content is stored locally on the device, to preserve user privacy of such sensitive personal information. Its quite different to your average quantified self logging tool, notesWood. Its really personal so for now we wanted to keep it quite self-contained.ustwo hasbeen beta testing the appwith around 500 users before launch, and has foundpeople areusingit in a variety of different ways  although most people are using it two to three times per week, rather than (as ithad expected) multiple times per day.Theres some people weve noticed that they use it just when theyre facing situations where they need to break free of the thinking habit or the style that they are stuck in and then some people are using it daily to log their mood but they dont go that deep in terms of their journaling habit, says Wood. And then some people are using it to figure out what makes them more content, day to day.It was quite an interesting design challenge because theres legacy ways of doing something within the psychology space, so we wanted to be true to the kind of scientific roots of that discipline, but at the same time we were really pushing the boundaries in terms of how could we make this a customer facing applicationthat was slightly playful but not too playful, simple, intuitive but not patronising, not too academic but still intelligent, she adds.We were constantly trying to strike the right notes.While there are quite a few apps in a similarspace  from journaling apps like Momentoto life tracking apps like Expereal ustwo reckons Moodnotes has something a little more well-roundedto offer thanwhats already out there.Its more than a mood tracking app, its a journaling tool, says Wood. I would say its on the cusp between the two. And the benefit of this one is it can provide value to the user depending on whether they are encountering a negative situation or a positive one. They can still learn something about themselves and grow their self awareness.A lot of the mood tracking apps or the apps that target more anxiety or depression tend to go a bit more towards unpacking those negative situations and then I think its done its jobs. Our app is giving something to people on both sides.For ustwo, the m-health space is a brave new world. Its mainfocus to date, aside from commercial work building apps for other companies, has been games  with the aforementioned Monument Valley and other in-house efforts like Whale Trail, plus other consumer apps such as messaging apps and then last year another joint venture project for the fan-focused Dice mobile gig ticketing app.Efforts with Diceare ongoing, but ustwos Sprinz said the company waskeen to diversify its output further  hence the push into m-health, and the partnership with Thriveport.The background is that most of the studio is really interested in doing some work in the health and wellbeing space, and were aware of the fact that unlike, for example, finance or retail where we have a huge amount of experience in those areas, health is more of a passion point  but we have less on the ground product development experience. And so we were looking for ways, as part of our investment projects and internal research, to uncover more work that we could do and put new lenses on problems that we were aware were affecting the industry, says Sprinz.When we formed some interesting proposition ideas we were aware that in order to really make a difference in the health space we needed to convene the right kind of partnership, she adds.Thriveports Dorian says the focus of the partnership is about enhancing the design element to make it more engaging, more accessible, have even broader mainstream appeal.You can have a delightful or pleasant experience with the app and yet be exposed to content that is normally found in therapy, or through clinical self help books but in a way that you dont normally find cumbersome or dry or boring, he adds.With Moodnotes its a return to the basics but given how the technology, including design knowledge, UI advancements and understanding has evolved over the past five+ years [since MoodKit launched] it enabled us to take a fresh look at how we would deliver this sort of content with high design but a very focused objective for the app.How much hard science underpins Moodnotes (and MoodKit)? No random placebo-controlled trials as yet, but Dorian, who is a board certified clinical and police psychologist, argues this is largely downto the newness of the m-health space.This area of research is in its infancy but a fair amount of research has emerged over the past half-dozen or so years pertaining to the feasibility, usability, and, more recently, efficacy of such apps  with findings that are generally quite encouraging, albeit limited, he tells TechCrunch.MoodKit is also now part of a large-scale controlled efficacy trial currently taking place in Australia, addsDorian.There are other m-health startups using apps as adelivery mechanism to scale up access to CBT.Big Healths Sleepio, for instance, which uses CBT methods to helpinsomnia sufferers get a better nights sleep. That startup has conductedaplacebo-controlled randomized trial to support its claims thatdigital sleep interventions can be helpful, but its unusual for doing so  and claimedit asthe worlds first such trial for a digital health product.One thing is certainly true: m-health apps can be lower cost way ofdelivering CBT vs going to therapy, although Dorian also argues they can work well as a therapy supplement (but of course not everyone can afford full-time therapy).When well designed, apps also hold out the promise of a moreaccessible way in to CBT techniques vsthe other low-cost alternative of self-administering CBT from a book.SoMoodKit and its ilk are effectively the digital forerunners shapingthenext generation of self-help tools aiming to build onthe size and success of the very large (and lucrative) self-help book market by leveraging the power and ubiquity of smartphones to deliver CBTcontent in new ways.Ive had so many patients tell me in my direct work with them they just so appreciate not having to pull out a pencil and paper, that they can just write onto their phone, adds Dorian. More importantly, if theyre reading content that they wouldnt normally want to be seen reading in public  like overcoming your personality disorder, or something  they dont want that book exposed on the bus. And so its discreet.For all people know youre simply texting or writing an email or what have you. In reality youre probably selecting feelings or evaluating your thoughts or making a journal entry. So I think thats probably its biggest win over self help books, among many other reasons.
