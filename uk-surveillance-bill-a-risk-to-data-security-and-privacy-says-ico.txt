The U.K.s Information Commissioners Office has criticized the draft Investigatory Powers billwarning about the risksofrequiring communications service providers toweaken encryption, and also asserting thatno clear case has been made for why the state should require data on all its citizens to be retained for a full year.The IP bill is the governments attempt to updateand extend thesurveillance capabilities of the security and intelligence agencies  replacing the long-in-the-tooth patchwork of legislation currently used to authorize intercepts with a clearerlegal framework. Its aiming to have a new law passedby the end of this year when emergency surveillance legislation, DRIPA, expires.Giving oral evidencelast week to the joint select committee currently examining the bill, information commissioner Christopher Graham was asked whether the bill gets the balance right, between privacy and security. Its very difficult to judge whether the bill gets the balance right, he said. Because the one thing we dont have in the voluminous material that has been put before you is any real evidence, as opposed to the occasional anecdote, for the utility of the information thats sought.The bill proposes that data can be required to be retained for 12 months but theres no particular explanation of why 12 months  rather than six months or 18 months  is desirable because there is no indication of the use that such information has been put to overmany months and years in the normal way ofdealing with serious crime and terrorism.Parliament needs to recognize that the various data protection rights afforded to individuals, he continued, and be wary of signing off a blank cheque in regards to the security services appetite for information  arguing instead there should be a system of ongoingproportionality reviews, once the legislation has passed, to ensure data protection obligations continue to be met.He went so far as to suggest that a rolling sunset clause or yearly renewal requirement be embedded within the legislation to enforce proportionality  and avoid the risks associated with data retention overreach.Parliament renewed the Prevention of Terrorism Act year by year. I cant see why we shouldnt have a similar arrangement for something so fundamental as this bill, he argued.Data protection is a fundamental right, under the charter of fundamental rights of the European Union, so I dont think its a question of just signing off a blank cheque, he added.It is asserted that this information is very important for the detectionof crime, and the prevention of terrorism, I think it would be sensible and wise for parliament to review, from time to time, how its working in practice. What use is being used of this great mass of data that will be required to be retained by communications service providers?Graham warned specifically of the huge risk of vast caches of retained information being exploitedby bad actors,or otherwise leaking out because ofthe security challenges createdbyan ongoingrequirement to store so muchpersonaldata.Asked by the committee whatsort of sanctions could be put in place to mitigate the risk of misuse of retained data by rogue individuals, such as within police forces or other organizations storing the data,Graham suggested parliament could enact a more deterrent-based penalty  such as a prison sentence, rather than the fine-only regime afforded by current legislation that pertains to this area.But heagain emphasizedthat too much retained data itself can generate too muchrisk. Ergothe best form of mitigation is to retainless data in the first place.It merely underlines the point that when you require communications service providers to retain a massive collection of data for a year then it creates a risk. Its there. People may do stupid things with it, said Graham.[Its] a whole pile of stuff whichcan get lost, inappropriately accessed from the criminal point of view and so on  and its because that risk is created by the legislation then youve got to have some very powerful safeguards to make sure the legislationisregularly reviewed, that it isbeing used for what its meant to be used for.On encryption, in itswritten evidence to the committee, the ICO also warns that notices requiring the removal of electronic protection should not be permitted to lead to the removal or weakening of encryption, given the risk to the security of personal data generally.Itspecificallyflags upclause 189 in the draft bill, noting that this permits the Secretary of State to impose obligations relating to the removal of electronic protection applied by a relevant operator to any communications or data.This could be a far reaching measure with detrimental consequences to the security of data and safeguards which are essential to the publics continued confidence in the handling and use of their personal information, the ICO writes, adding: The practical application of such requirement in the draft is unclear in the draft bill and the accompanying Guide to Powers and Safeguards does not provide specific details to enable the full extent of the provision to be assessed.Last month Apple also raised concerns about the IP bills implications for encryption, writing in its own submission to the committee that: The best minds in the world cannot rewrite the laws of mathematics. Any process that weakens the mathematical models that protect user data will by extension weaken the protection. And recent history is littered with cases of attackers successfully implementing exploits that nearly all experts either remained unaware of or viewed as merely theoretical.Five other Internet companies  Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo  have also raised concerns about the implications of the proposed legislation on encryption, calling for more clarity in the language used in the bill in their own jointwritten submission.We reject any proposals that would require companies to deliberately weaken the security of their products via backdoors, forced decryption, or any other means. We therefore have concerns that the Bill includes obligations relating to the removal of electronic protection applied by a relevant operator to any communication or data and that these are explicitly intended to apply extraterritorially with limited protections for overseas providers, they write.We appreciate the statements in the Bill and by the Home Secretary that the Bill is not intended to weaken the use of encryption, and suggest that the Bill expressly state that nothing in the Bill should be construed to require a company to weaken or defeat its security measures.The government has been accused of putting out mixed messages when it comes to its legislative intentions around encryption, with the Prime Minister last yearappearing to suggest he wanted to ban encryption, before apparently backpedaling.The Home Secretary also subsequently appeared to make comments in support of encryption yet the wording of the legislation remainsvague enough thatconcerns about itsimplications for encrypted services persist.For example, many speakers at an event held to discuss various aspects of the IP bill last week expressed similar worriesabout vague language in the draft legislation leaving too much open to interpretation.The joint select committee is continuing to take evidence from witnesses, and will hear from Home Secretary Theresa May tomorrow. Its expected to file a report withrecommendations by the middle of next month  suggestionsthat will doubtless feed into the coming months of debate as MPs and Peers in parliament and the House of Lords chew over the bills detail and try to achieve that sought for balance between security and privacy.
