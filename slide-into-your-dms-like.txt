Whats hilarious is just how casual you look riding it. Youre basically standing upright while cruising up to 8 miles at 5 miles per hour on a single charge.On sale for $995, though, I dont know whos going to buy it. And neither does SoloWheel, the company who makes it. I asked and their representative told me theyve seen it bought for kids as a toy, for adults to travel long indoor distances like at airports, and for work to jet around warehouses.The tilt-based controls were surprisingly reactive and I didnt want for more power. Still, I dont think any amount of riding would make you feel like you werent about to faceplant. Standing up straight and forward seems like too precarious of a position to ride safely around traffic or any kind of ground turbulence.The Hovertrax squarely lands in the fun to ride for five minutes at a gadget conference, insane to buy category.
