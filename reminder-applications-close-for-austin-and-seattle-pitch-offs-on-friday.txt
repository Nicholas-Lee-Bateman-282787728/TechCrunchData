The time has come, my friends. This time next week, well have chosen around 20 amazing companies to participate in the TechCrunch Pitch-Offs in Austin and Seattle. Applications close on Friday, June 5. In other words, now is the time to apply if you havent done so. Selected entrepreneurs will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product on-stage to our audience and a panel of local VC judges and TechCrunch writers. First place winners receive a table at Disrupt SFs Startup Alley, and two tickets to the show. Second place gets two tickets to Disrupt, and the Audience Choice winner takes home one ticket to the big show. If this sounds like your jam, head over here and apply right now. If you just want to hang out with cool people from your local tech scene, do a little networking (or perhaps some poaching hiring), then you should buy tickets because theyre selling out fast.Buy tickets to the Austin Meetup + Pitch-Off on June 23 right here.
