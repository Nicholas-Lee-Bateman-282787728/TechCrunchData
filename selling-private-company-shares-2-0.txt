However, as the market has grown in terms of both buyers and sellers,private companies have mandated an increasing number of restrictions,with each handlingsecondaryshare salesdifferently.In order to betterappreciatewhat has changed in terms of process, it is essential to understand aprivate companyspossiblegoalsrelated to secondary sales.A primary goal of private companies allowingsecondary sales is toprotecttheircorporate information financials, key customers, valuation, etc.As a result,thequalityand reputationof theproposedbuyerisvery importantas companies and existing investors have become increasingly reluctant to allowjust anyoneonto their capitalization tables.In concept, private companies are not necessarily opposedto secondary share sales, as they have come to recognize the HR benefitsassociated with possible employee liquidity. With the mean time from funding to exit for a private company increasing from 2-5 years in the early 2000s to an average of 6-10 years today, an employee may hold illiquid private company stock for quite some time while undergoing major life events such as marriage, the birth of a child or a home purchase.Hence, private companies have come to realize that the allowance of secondary sales can be a powerful tool for talent recruitment and retention, as it allows employees with more financial flexibility, thereby allowing employees to maintain focus on growing company value (seeEmployee liquidity  good for private companies?)However, handling theseone-offprocesses requires significantinternalresources,assecondary share sales arean additive agenda item for the already resource-constrained CFO and/orGeneral Counsel.Companies try to limit theadministrative demands involved in these processes bycreating standardizedprotocols related totransfer documentsor approval processes.Private companies are wary to limit any perception of asymmetric information related to these transactions, and want toensure that both the buyer and the seller have similar information sets.As a function of this, companies are reluctant to get involved, as they wantto limit the impact of secondary sales on their 409A valuation process and common stock option issuance price.Secondary transactions were once largely ignored in 409A valuations by companies, valuation firms and auditors. In recent years, however, increased SEC scrutiny on 409A valuations has prompted the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) to create guidelines that specifically recognize secondary transactions.Therefore, private companies have started to become more cognizant with the factors that may influence this value, including but not limited to: (i) whether a third-party buyer was involved in the transaction and how much information they had, (ii) how broad the process was and how many counterparties were involved and (iii) the type of security that was sold, transferred or redeemed in the transaction (seeThe New Normal: Secondaries and the 409A Valuation Process).Prior to sellingshares in a private company,an investor must first determinewhattypeof stockis held(i.e., preferred versus common),thenrefer to the company bylaws (specifically, a section oftentimescalled Transfers of Capital Stock),whichcontainthegoverningconditionsand requirements for that class of stock.Beyond this, there areseveral key questions that willhelpdetermine how tosell part or all of your shares:Does the company allow share transfers? Many private companies today,notably some of the unicorn companies,haveincluded specificrestrictive sale provisionsin their bylaws thatlimit or inhibitthe ability for shareholders to sell or transfer their sharesunder any circumstance.Most of these companies control whocan selland whenby managing and restricting external sale processes (existing investors or the company itself are the buyers).Which buyers hasthe company approved to be shareholders?Many private companies haveasked our firm and a short list of others to be onapproved buyer lists.These are typically 1-4funds that the companyand/or Board of Directors has approvedto increase their share ownership and who specialize in secondary sales.In certain instances, a company will direct their Right of First Refusal on share sales to the buyer group so they have a short list of long-term and trusted shareholders.Is there a company liquidity program in place already?Many private companies create organizedshareholder liquidity programs with funds that specialize in secondary sales and purchases. They typically work with funds that have pre-existing relationships with the current shareholder base and management team.In summation, while privates companiesunderlying goals relating to secondary share sales have not changed significantly,the way in which theseprocesses arehandledhas.We believe thatoverthe next three years,we may see a more fluid market for secondary sales and transfers asprocesses become more uniform and standardized.
