Makers rule the world. Whether you sling code or craft hardware, the ability to build is of absolute importance in the new economy. Thats why Im pleased to announce that Ill be hanging out with Makerbot CEO Jonathan Jaglom, TechShop head Mark Hatch, and Shapeways CEO Peter Weijmarshausen on the main stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF.Jaglom took over Makerbot this year and is slowly expanding the company around the world and in the U.S. Hatch is a living legend in the maker community and his shop is the springboard for some of the amazing gear we use today. Finally Peter Weijmarshausen of Shapeways has been making 3D dreams come true for years and his company is at the forefront of rapid prototyping and manufacturing.What will we talk about? The maker movement, for one, and the current trends associated with the space. Who will make the next amazing gadget? What does it take to make money in making? And what will happen in the next decade?I truly look forward to meeting these folks on the Disrupt stage and I hope youll join us.Disrupt SF will roll through town from September 21st to the 23rd, right over at Pier 70.
