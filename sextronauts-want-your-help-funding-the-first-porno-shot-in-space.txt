Another day, another attempt to shoot a crowdfunded pornographic film in space for three million dollars. PornHub [NSFW] has created an Indiegogo page to help support their effort to film the first porn in space, the aptly titled SEXPLORATION. The plan is to send actors and, presumably, a camera crew into space where they will film the procreative act.The plan is a perfect storm of modern tropes: Porn! Space! Crowdfunding! Porn! But it also sounds pretty cool and if they do end up raising over three million dollars I suspect it will be one of the biggest-budget porn shoots in history. Write the creators:If the movie doesnt get funded youll get your cash back and, according to PornHubs researchers, sex in space is possible so the mission wont be a dud.The campaign seems to be moving along at quite a clip but I suspect that it might be a tough job trying to get folks to grab a $1 Certificate of Endorsement let alone $150,000 pledge that gets you a sextronaut spacesuit complete with used underwear. Furthermore if I worked at NASA Id be slightly concerned. As Elon Musk knows, the future of space exploration now seems to be in the hands of the private sector  in some cases quite literally.
