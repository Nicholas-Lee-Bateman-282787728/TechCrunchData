Weight loss company Weight Watchers continues its recent acquisition spree with the purchase of Hot5. The startup will join a couple of other mobile apps Weight Watchers has bought to help its customers get in shape.Hot5originally launched in August 2013 and moved to a subscription model enabling customers to pay monthly and receive access to a wide range of short fitness videos they can use from the app. The app has had 400,000 downloads from users and tens of thousands of monthly active users currently. But by being a part of Weight Watchers, the company could pour gasoline on its adoption among consumers who are already customers of the diet and fitness company.This is one of a series of acquisitions Weight Watchers has made over the past year or so, as its been trying to expand available services that it can offer to its customers.Last spring, itbought Wello, a service that connects customers with personal trainers online. The company followed that up with the acquisition of Weilos, which provides a platform for sharing images and weight loss success stories.The idea apparently is to increase the opportunity for success from Weight Watchers clients by integrating more exercise options into its system. Hot5s two apps will continue to be available, and Weight Watchers is likely to push members to try it out through various marketing campaigns.
