Grand Central Tech, the startup hub and business accelerator now welcoming in its second batch of companies into its massive office space overlookingGrand Central Station in New York, is something of an odd duck in the wild world of incubators, co-working spaces and accelerators that stalk the early stage investment landscape.The year-long program invests no cash, takes no equity, and requires nothing more than a commitment to rent office space in the massive 1.1 million square foot building it occupies, when companies are finished with their year-long, rent-free stay in the co-working space.Its approach has enabled it to draw some heavy-hitting entrepreneurial talent in its latest cache of companies.Our goal is to create that single point of density of the best technology companies, says Charles Bonello, who co-foundedthe spacealongsidehis high school friend Matt Harrigan.What the entrepreneurs want is the community and the opportunity to help build something together that is tremendous. Were going to work together, were going to build badass companies and do it in a way that raises the bar, Bonello said.In many cases, the companies that are entering the Grand Central program dont need a cash investment from Grand Central, and would rather leverage the impressive network of corporate partners and mentors from across the consumer goods, financial services, retail, and technology industries that Grand Centrals brain trust has assembled.According to Harrigan, the companies in last years batch of 18 companies raised an impressive $35 million in financing, all-told. Not bad for a clutch of early-stage startups.The program (its hard to call this thing an accelerator) counts Microsoft, Google, Intuit, IBM, LOreal USA, Pepsico North America, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs among its sponsors. And the whole thing is financed by billionaire real estate backers, the MIlstein family.Whats also distinct about the Grand Central project is the collection of serial entrepreneurs and seasoned professionals that the project attracts.Among the companies housed in its last batch was Augmate,a developer of services that integrate business applications into any wearable device, and Nagare Membranes, a developer of water filtration technology which raised $10.5 million, and was founded by serial entrepreneur Rob McGinnis.GCT is quite a bit different from everybody else. we try to attract the best companies working on the biggest issuesby offering the best resources on the best terms, says Bonello.The plan seems to be working. The firms newest batch has managed to woo serial entrepreneurs like BradHargreaves, a co-founder of General Assembly, whose new startup Common, aims to successfully replicate the idea of startups like Campus and the Embassy Network.Hargreaves isnt the only successful founder who will be found walking Grand Central Techs halls over the next year. Marleen Vogelaar, one of the founders of Shapeways, will be basing her new 3D printing company Ziel Fashion, in the office space; and so will Gilt Groupe founder Alexis Maybank, whose stealthy startup Project September, will also call Grand Central Tech home.While Bonello and Harrigan may not ask for equity with Grand Central Tech, the programs backers, New York billionaire real estate investors the Milstein Properties, do get a commitment for four years of rentals from the company in the building  if the companies can afford it. So far all of the companies from the initial cohort have signed leases.We want to be in a 1.1 million square foot building that is filled the best technology companies in the world that give a shit about the community, says Bonello.Here are all of the companies joining Grand Central Tech for 2015.
