Tencent has made its first investment in Africa under the banner of its WeChat messaging service. WeChat Africa, a joint venture between Tencent and Naspers, announced an investment inM4JAM(Money For Jam), a South Africa-based mobile job service that connects to WeChat.The service is much like the TaskRabbit of old, in so much that companies push small jobs out to theM4JAMs community of users, who respond via their phone to apply/accept jobs.From the companys website:M4JAM is a solution that connects Brands who want to get jobs done to Jobbers who are able to complete the jobs using their mobile devices. Simply put  by breaking bigger jobs up into smaller jobs of 10 minutes or less, microjobbing is a win-win situation for Brands and Jobbers.The company didnt disclose the value of the deal, but, strategically, it is notable.Tencent has put large sums ofmoney into companies and services that connect with WeChat in China  it is an investor in taxi-hailing service Did Dache and online retailer JD.com, two multi-billion dollar services integrated into its chatapp and it has employeda similar, scaled-down approachhere.WeChat has close to 500 million monthly active users. Tencent doesnt break that number down by location, but it is fair to assume that the vast majority are in China, where WeChat isthe top social network.Tencent has had a focus on Africa for some time, likerivals Line, WhatsApp and others. These companies believe that the potentialgrowth of smartphones, which will serve asthe primary internet access point for most of the continent, make mobile messaging apps potentially very powerful platforms. Investing inservices like M4JAM could helpWeChat get an edge over its rival messaging apps, whilst also allowing startups themselves to tap into the appsuserbase.[M4JAMs] disruptive business model has turned business as usual on its head from both the end consumer and the brands perspective, resulting in a rapid and overwhelming demand from both users and companies to be on the platform, saidBrett Loubser, Head of WeChat Africa, in a statement.It isnt clear how popular WeChat is in Africa, or South Africa in particular, but now that it has an investment in the region under its belt, it will be interesting to see whether Tencentpursues other deals to grow its ecosystem and appeal to new users. Loubser previously told Memeburn that the messaging appcould not succeed in Africa unless it localizes its brand, whichsuggests theres much more to come.
