Yahoo just announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire style-focused community Polyvore.In a blog post about the deal, Yahoos senior vice president of publisher products Simon Khalaf highlighted Polyvores expertise on community-driven experiences and retailer-supported commerce and wrote that the deal will accelerate Yahoos digital content growth strategy across the areas of social, mobile and native.Khalaf also said the Polyvore team will be joining Yahoo and working out of the companys offices in Sunnyvale, San Francisco and New York, with co-founder and CEO Jess Lee reporting directly to him.While Yahoo is highlighting its plans to incorporate Polyvores commerce and community features onto properties like Yahoo Style and Yahoo Beauty, a spokesperson said there will be no change to the startups website and apps: With Yahoos support and investment, the technology and business are expected to grow with time.Lee said something in her post about the deal:Going forward, Polyvore will still be the same Polyvore that you love, but well have more resources to make it even bigger & better. Our mission of empowering people to feel good about their style will stay the same. Well continue to add cool new product features and roll out new perks for top members. Weve accomplished a lot on our own, but together with Yahoo we can take Polyvore to its fullest potential.Theres some personal history here, too. Lee participated in Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayers associate product manager program at Google, and she said  the advice Mayer gave her during the job interview  later inspired her to leave Google for Polyvore.Yahoo has been notably acquisitive during Mayers tenure, but that seemed to have slowed down this year. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
