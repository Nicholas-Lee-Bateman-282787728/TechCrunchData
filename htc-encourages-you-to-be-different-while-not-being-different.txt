HTC has released a new commercial whose primary message is Be Different. While this would be fine in general, I suspect many of us will notice a distinct similarity between this commercial and a number of other commercials, including one filmed three decades ago, in which a troublemaker tears down the status quo in order to sell consumer electronics.This idea, obviously, doesnt belong to Apple. But the HTC One A9 already looks like a clone of the iPhone and the marketing, aimed at insulting all the sheeple in coffee shops around the world who prefer iOS to Android, is derivative as well. If you cant beat them duplicate them?So heres what I propose: the following is a better version of Apples Heres To The Crazy Ones ad copy. Feel free to borrow liberally from it and just thank me with a beer when we meet next, handset manufacturers. It seems like a logical next step.via 9to5mac
