News startup Stringris announcing that it has raised $1.5 million in funding.Co-founder and CEO Lindsay Stewart previously worked as a TV news producer for ABC, Bloomberg and Fox News, and she said the service was really born out of this newsroom need of getting footage quickly, in a transparent way.For example, if theres a big tornado, TV stations are going to want footage, but they might not have the resources (or be close enough) to send their own team. Thats a need that the existing stringer system aims to fill, but Stewart and her team think they can make the process faster, more frictionless and more inclusive.Stringr says that when a media organization logs in, they can post a request for the footage that they need and get something back in under an hour. Stewart said Stringr is open to professional videographers, as well asanybody whos interested in news, anybody whos interested in videography.At the same time, she saidStringr isnt the same as mostcrowdsourced news services (such as Fresco News)  the point isnt to get everybody to contribute, but rather to make sure there are enough good videographers to provide high-quality responses to newsroom requests.We allow anybody to join Stringr, but the only way you win as a videographer is if you provide valuable footage, she said. Stewart also said that one of the key parts of Stringrs approach is a curation team that works with both the media customersand the videographers. On the media side, that means ensuring that they get the footage theyre looking for, while on the videographer side, it meansguiding them to shoot better videos.The funding, meanwhile, comes fromMatter (the media-focused startup accelerator where Stringr was incubated), Founder.org and Signia Ventures.We have learned a lot about our videographers in our pilot markets in the last year, Stewart said. Now were going to take those learnings and apply themto a nationwide push.
