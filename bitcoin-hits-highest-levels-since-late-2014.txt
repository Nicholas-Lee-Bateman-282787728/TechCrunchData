The price of bitcoin is itself only a single indicator but one that matters. The higher the price of bitcoin reaches, the more media attention that it is afforded. So, up means up.Through the recent discussion of bitcoin and blockchain, we have seen a retread of the discussion of what is fad, what is fact and what is future.

The latter  complete collapse.The revolution will come in steps. Who knew.
