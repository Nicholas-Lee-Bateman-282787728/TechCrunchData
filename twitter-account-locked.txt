Did you just get an e-mail from Twitter letting you know that your account had been locked? Youre not alone  not at all.There seems to be a MASSIVEspike in the number of users complaining about their accounts being locked right now.Its unclear whetherthis is intentional on Twitters part, or if its an automated tool getting a bit overzealous.Update: It was the latter. Twitter is currently working on the issue.Many users are assuming its because they follow back  meaning they quickly (and generally automatically) follow anyone who follows them. Done right, its a way to boost your follow count in a mostly artificial and arguably useless way.Others, however, argue that theyve done nothing wrong  they just tweet a lot.The email from Twitter to users says that each locked account appears to have exhibited automated behavior that violates the Twitter Rules, and that the lock was put in place to protect Twitter from unauthorized logins.Given the recent increase in high-profile account hijackings of late  including that of Twitters own CFO, Anthony Noto  its likely that Twitter is hastily toiling away at itsautomated account-moderation tools. Crank the sensitivity too high too fast, and its easy to imagine lots of not-so-guilty accounts getting pulled in and locked by mistake.Weve reached out to Twitter for insight into whats going on and will update this post if we hear back.Update: Twitter writes:We are aware of an issue where some users are unable to Tweet and have received a notice telling them theyve been locked out.Our engineers are currently investigatingUpdate #2:  Roughly an hour after the first locks hit, Twitter tells us the issue should be fixed. Were still seeing reports of lock-outs trickle in, but they should start tapering off.
