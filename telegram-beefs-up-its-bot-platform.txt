Later today at its f8 developer conference Facebook isexpected to unveil a big push into bots on its Messenger platform. So little surprise that rival messaging platform Telegram has taken the opportunity to remind people it launched its own bot platform back in June 2015  by announcing a 2.0 update to said platform today, the biggest update since launch it says.What are bots?Here the term refers to automated chatbots thatsit on a messaging platform letting users interact with a third party software program, via the familiar chat interface, to easily perform certain actions  and, crucially, do sowithout having to leavethe messaging platform  actions such as searching for a particularURL to share in a chat, say, or asking for information about the weather or news. (TechCrunch has its very own news bot on Telegram, for example.) The userjust needs to ping the bot in question to tap into theexternal service it plugs into.Manybots can effectively bethought of as an alternativesearch mechanism thats embedded into an existing platform and drawingon a cache of specific data  replacing the need for users to go and perform a series of external searches to retrieve whatever third party datatheyre after.Telegramsbot 2.0updatebrings a clutchof new featuresto build out the utility of its bot platform including the ability for devs to build bots that can send any type of content supported on Telegram, such as documents, MP3s, videos, stickers, animations and contacts; support for location-based services; and the ability to deeplyintegrate with other services based on users phone numbers.Its also adding inline keyboards that can bestructured to mesh with aparticular bots messages  so users can tap on pre-determinedbuttons to respond to the bot, rather than needing to type out specific instructions.And while Telegram previously supportedthe ability for bots to offer custom reply keyboards, such as for example with its sticker rating bot which offers buttons for 1 star, 2 stars and so on, inline keyboards take things a step further not sending messages to the chat but supporting behind-the-scenes buttons such as callback buttons and URL buttons. Theplatform also now lets bots edit their own messages.Thanks to message editing and inline keyboards with callbacks, developers can now build interactive UIs inside their bots without having to clutter users chat with multiple messages that are quickly outdated (which we sometimes saw before), explainsTelegram founder Pavel Durov.Telegram hasbuilt four sample bots to show off the new features:@music, a bot for searching for and sharing classical music;@youtube, a bot for searching and sharing YouTubevideos;@foursquare, a bot for finding nearby restaurants and places to share addresses with friends; and@sticker, a bot for finding stickers using  you guessed it emoji as the start point for a sticker search. (So if, like me, youfind yourselfoverusing the tears of laughter emoji, this is one way to quickly search out alternatives ) Telegram users need to be updated to the latest version of the appto interact with the new bots.These sample bots are but the beginning. Our Bot API 2.0 allows developers to create fluid and easy-to-use interfaces for powerful bots. And we will be seeing a lot of new ones in the coming months, after all, 2016 is the year of bots, it adds in a blog post announcing the update.How popular are bots on Telegram? The startup claims a substantial chunk of users are now regularly chatting with bots.Last year bot adoption was driven mainly by advanced users, but now bots have gone mainstream. Over 20 per cent of Telegrams monthly users view content generated by bots, it tells TechCrunch.Back in February, the messaging appannounced its platform had reached 100 million monthly active users, saying it was adding 350,000 new users daily  with some 15 billion missives generated per day. Sothats apparently some 20 million Telegram users now viewing bot-generated content on a monthly basis.What does the startupthink about Facebook launching its own big push aroundbots? We are happy that other platforms are catching up as it is good for the ecosystem, it says.Also today, Telegramhas announced tweaks to sharing and previewsin the app, includinga new lower friction video player (with fewer buttons to tap to start watching content); easier to use sticker pack previews; support for tap and hold previews on iOS for GIFs and bot content; and a major redesign of the Telegram Android app.
