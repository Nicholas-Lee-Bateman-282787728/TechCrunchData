The Russian government isnt too happy with Reddit these days. But its not even over criticalcomments made about the governments handling of Ukraine, its about a single thread on the site regardinghow to grow narcotics.Roskomnadzor, essentially Russias FCC,announced on Vkontakte, the Russian Facebook,that it has asked Reddit to remove asingle thread related to growing shrooms, and that it hasnt so much as gotten a reply,reports IBTimes.Image posted on Roskomnadzors Vkontakte pageThe request for the removal of the thread was made at the behest of Russias Federal Drug Control Service. The post ends by saying that if Reddit chooses not to reply to the request, the government may shut down access to the site in the country completely.Those who have contacts with the [Reddit] administration  ask them to check theiremail for messagesfrom Roskomnadzor, otherwisea number of operators may block the entire site, the Vkontakte post read, according to a rough translation.Its kind of hilarious really, the government organization is basically threatening a total shutdown of the site, while asking its followers on Vkontakte to politely reach out to any Reddit employees they know and ask them to check their email for any messagesfrom the government organization.Onlinereferences to using or manufacturing drugshave never been taken too lightly byRussias Federal Drug Control Service. The department has routinely submitted offending sites to theRoskomnadzor for inclusion on their expansive Internet blacklist.In 2013,Roskomnadzor, also lengthily referred to astheFederal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom Information Technologies and Mass Communications, blocked Wikipedia in its entirety for a single article on Cannabis smoking.In response to thatblocking, a spokesman forRoskomnadzor told a Russian media outlet:It has been on the register [of sites with banned information] for a long time. I dont know why its only now that theyve woken up.All thats really clear is that the Russian government needs to chill out; maybe someone on r/trees can score them a weed hookup?
