Mixmax, which is making e-mail interactive with apps that set-upcalendar meetings and polls, raised $1.5 million from Harrison Metal, Floodgates Mike Maples and Ann Miura-Ko, Ram Shriram of Sherpalo Ventures and angels Eric Ries, Soundcloud CEO Alex Ljung, Nuzzel CEO Jonathan Abrams, Inkling CEO Matt MacInnis and Soundclouds Eric Wahlforss.Its crazy that we have these incredibly powerful devices and were still communicating the same way we did 25 years ago, said co-founder Olof Math, who added that his experience in Gmail doesntreally differ that much from the Pine e-mail client he used two decades ago.Mathsaidthe web has since evolved, with lots of expressive communication forms through video-conferencing and collaborative editing.E-mail remains static, plain, and un-actionable, the company said in a statement announcing its funding round today.Mixmax is a simple Chrome plug-in that adds extra functionality to your G-mailaccounts. You can put in little apps or widgets to schedule meetings, annotate documents, makepurchases, confirmorders or complete surveys  all within the e-mail. (So you dont have to context switch to another calendar or browser tab to do a task.)Recipients dont need to have Mixmax installed to see any of the additional content. Theres also aMixmax SDK, which lets developers build other kinds of apps that can work inside of email.Math and his co-founders Chanpory Rith, and Brad Vogel came out of Inkling where they built an e-book authoring platform called Habitat. Theyve also done stints at Skype, Google and Apple on communications products.They plan to use the $1.5 million in fresh funding to hireadditional engineers, expand the platform and build out the SDK.
