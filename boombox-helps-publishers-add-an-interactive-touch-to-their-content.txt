Quizzes! Lists! Quizlists! Okay, I made the last one up. My point is, it seems like publishers are always trying something new to keep visitors clicking and reading. Butif you dont have a giant pile of cash from investors, it can be tough to keep up.Hence the launch of a new product calledBoomboxwas created by a Lehi, Utah-based startup called Movement Ventures (note: not actually a venture firm). Movement previously created standalone quiz and poll products, called Qzzr and Pollcaster, which were used to ask readers questions like, Which TED Talk are you? and What Color Is This Goddamn Dress?Co-founder/CEO Josh Little said the aim for Boomboxis to build a broader suite of products that publishers need to introduce BuzzFeed-like engagement to their content.As the web becomes a more immersive and personalized experience, both the audience and the publishers have a desire to create those experiences, Little said. The limitation for many publishers and brands especially is they dont have the engineering teams or even the budget to go build these tools.As Littles comment suggests, Boombox isnt just for online news publishers, but also for any brand that wants to connect with its customers through content marketingThe product is free, with a paid version that includes additional features like removing the Boombox branding.Movement Ventures is also announcing that it has raised $5.5 million in Series A funding led by Pelion Venture Partners, with the aim of continuing development on Boombox.
