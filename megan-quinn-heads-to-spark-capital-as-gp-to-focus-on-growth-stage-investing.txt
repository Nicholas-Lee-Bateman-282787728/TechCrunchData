Today, investor Megan Quinn shared that shed be joining Spark Capital as a general partner for its growth stage fund (its first), which we covered last year. Quinn stepped down from KPCB this year after nearly three years with the firm.Heres what Quinn had to say on the new role:Three and half years ago I made the transition from product builder to investor. It has been an amazing and humbling experience to meet, invest and work with some of the most innovative and visionary founders in technology. As I said in July, being an investor is a privilege and one that I am grateful to have.
