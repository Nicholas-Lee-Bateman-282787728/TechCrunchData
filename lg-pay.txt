Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay therell be one more to add to the list soon. Thats because Korean phone maker LG just quietly outed plans to develop and deployits own mobile payment servicewhich,to the surprise of precisely nobody, will be called LG Pay.Its official! We have partnered with Shinhan Card and KB Kookmin Card to prepare for the launch of LG Pay, the company said inan update on its Facebook page.Those partner names will mean precious littleto most TechCrunch readers, unless you happen to live in South Korea or know the country well. Thats because they are local banks that LG will work with to launchLG Pay in its native Koreafirst. Theres no word on an international launch at this point.An LG spokesperson declined to give more specific details about LG Pay, but did tellTechCrunch that the company will have more details in the coming weeks.Might that mean an actual product or confirmation of plans for an international launch? We shall find out soon.While LG Pay might have a shot at becoming prominent in Korea, where it is among the top phone vendors,it is hard to see the service making much of an impact overseas  where LG lags Apple, Samsung and others on salesand thereare already a clutch of ambitiousmobile payment providers. Thats unlesstheres space for four different payment mechanisms, along all the third-parties that are in the space, too. Seems unlikely, right?Itmight sound unfair to make such a negative assertion before the product has even dropped.But if the challenge is tough for even Samsung, which has significantly greater marketshare than LG and a mobile payment solution that supports a wider selection of payment methods than Google andApples offerings, thenit is even stiffer for its lesser rivals.
