Facebook is marking the one-year anniversary of the launch of its Internet.org service, whichenables free mobile access to a selection of webservices in emerging markets, with a push to bring more mobile operatorsinto the project.One keypart of that charm offensiveis a dedicatedportalthat provides a go-to resource for operators seeking to connect with Facebook and offerthe service  which was first announced in 2013 to their subscribers. The site also lays out the business case, in Facebooks eyes,behind Internet.org.As we approach year two, weve taken everything weve learned from working closely with our partners and are now ready to scale Internet.org free basic services. Weve made it easier for any mobile operator to turn on Internet.org in new countries through a partner portal that includes technical tools and best practices, improving the process to offer free basic services to the unconnected, Facebook wrote in a blog post.Internet.org began with initial launches in Africa, but it has since expanded to cover 17 countries  including large populations like Pakistan, India and Indonesia  across three continents.Facebookargued today that more than half of the 9million users tohave used the service signed up for a paid-for data package of some kind within the first month, and that it has directly ledphone owners to adopt new services 50 percent faster than they otherwise would.Those claimsare obviouslydesigned to encourage operators to the program, to help them convert customers into data users and smartphones, but Internet.org has attracted plenty of criticismforviolating the principles of net neutrality.Mark Zuckerberg has refutedcallsloudest in India  that byconstructing aprogram of pre-selected services, Facebook and its operator partnersplay the role of gatekeeper rather than encouraginga free Internet.Facebook responded to that accusation by openingInternet.org to third-party developers, theoretically enabling anyoneto add their services (although there arecost considerations and operator-set regulations to content with),and today it said that the ratio of paying users adds further validation toits efforts.These points show that Internet.org is not only a successful tool in helping bring people online, but it is successful in showing people the value of the internet and helping to accelerate its adoption, the company wrote.The net neutrality argument will continue unabashed, but its a very important part of the package. Facebook is hoping that operators will putthese concerns to one side and see the business value that it claims Internet.org can deliver.It will be fascinatingto see whether we see an uptick in new launches or operators exercising caution in handling this potentially hot monetization potato. (Facebook and Internet.org could face regulation in India, for one place.)
