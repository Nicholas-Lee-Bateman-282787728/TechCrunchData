A group of U.S. and EU digital rights organizations and consumer NGOs  including the EFF, the U.S. Center for Digital Democracy, the European Consumer Organization and Privacy International  have issued a statement calling for a meaningful legal framework to protect fundamentalprivacy rights in the digital era.The statement comes as a criticalresponse to thepublication earlier this month of theBridges report:a joint project between U.S. and EU academics  and including the involvement of the Dutch data protection agency  advocating for continued reliance onexisting laws coupled withindustry self-regulation as a middle-of-the-road approach tosafeguarding privacy rights.The Bridges report advocates for, as they put it, a framework of practical options that advance strong, globally-accepted privacy values in a manner that respects the substantive and procedural differences between the two jurisdictions  such as offering standardized user controls and user complaint mechanisms, and best practices for the de-identification of user data, among other proposed measures.However the EFF et al are highly critical of thisapproach  dubbing it failed policy and remarkably out of touch with the current legal reality.Digital rights organization and consumer NGOs call on the Data Protection Commissioners to refocus their attention on the need to update and enforce privacy law, the group said today.The current legal reality on the U.S.-EU data privacy front includes the ruling,earlier this month, by Europes top court, the ECJ,invalidating the Safe Harbor data-sharing agreement whichhad governed data flows between the regions for some 15 years, allowing companies sending EU data to the U.S. for processingto self-certify they would provide adequate protection.The court ruled that such self-certification failed in anera of mass surveillance by government intelligence agency dragnets  opening the door toindividual reviews of data transfers bydata protection authorities inindividual European Member States.This isnot a situation conducive to operational certainty for businesses  with DPAs already issuing differing opinions on the current post-Safe Harbor scenario. For example, guidance issued by the U.K.s ICO differs greatly in tone from a position paper published by German data supervisory authorities in the wake of the ECJ ruling.Sowhile the ICO is telling businesses and organizations not to panic orrush to other transfer mechanisms that may turn out to be less than ideal  arguingthe impact of the judgement is still being analysed  the German DPAs suggest they will immediately be prohibiting data transfers to the U.S. that are solely based on Safe Harbor, as well asspecifying otherexplicit controls, such as that consent clauses cannot be used to sanction repeated, mass or routine data transfers.Meanwhile, the European Commission is attempting to hammer out a so-called Safe Harbor 2.0 agreement with the U.S. in the next few weeks, to try to reestablish a dataflowsagreement. Although any such dealis likely to face fresh legal challenges unless the U.S. agrees to substantial concessions on surveillance and privacy rights. (Yet only yesterday the Senate passed another bill that critics say will expand government agencies surveillance capabilities)With existing legal frameworks governing data protection under continued pressure from the surveillance state  and new techchallenges toprivacy pushing into the frame all the time, whether its from AI-powered big data processingor drone surveillancethe EFF et al are pressing the case for a comprehensive privacy legal framework  to offer robust consumer protection, and ultimately also create legalcertainty for businesses.Particularly after the Safe Harbor decision, the Bridges report is remarkably out of touch with the current legal reality and what we need to do to address it, they write, criticizing thereport for failing to recommendanysubstantive changes in law.The practical consequence of focusing instead on failed policies, such as self regulation, will be to make more difficult the work of the privacy experts around the world who could have otherwise benefitted from a meaningful discussion about how to move forward on legislation, aggressive enforcement, and other steps that are long overdue. Yes, they are difficult; all the more reason why we need to act now, they add.Responding to criticism of the Bridges report and approach, Daniel Weitzner, one of the project participants and director of MITsCybersecurity and Internet Policy Research Initiative, said the aim is not to encourage industry self-regulation but rather tocall on the FTC and European data protection authorities to engage incollaborative policy development.He also stressed that thecall for the development of better user control technologies is something the reportsayscan only happen with clear guidelines and legal interpretations from regulators.Were not saying industry should set rules through design (that would be self-regulation) but rather that policy guidance from governments is vital, Weitzner told TechCrunch.We do hope that we can contribute to progress on legislative development in both the US and EU, he added. I myself spent about three years working in the Obama Administration toward issuing and trying to get the US Congress to pass the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. That remains very important to me, but Im also pursuing other avenues for progress.Howeverthat Bill was described by critics such as the NYTas riddled with loopholes and appearing to be tailored to benefit Internet firms like Google and Facebook and little-known data brokers like Acxiom that have amassed detailed profiles of individuals.The paper dubbed it a weak reflection of U.S. consumer privacy concerns, concluding: No bill at all would have been better than this one, which would effectively codify bad behavior.Weitzner is also a paid advisor to Palantir,a big data analysis company, founded back in 2004, withinitial funding comingfrom the CIAs not-for-profit VC arm, In-Q-Tel.On its websiteIn-Q-Tellists its mission as being to identify, adapt, and deliver innovative technology solutions to support the missions of the Central Intelligence Agency and broader U.S. Intelligence Community.At the time of writing Weitzner had not responded to a request to confirm how much he is remunerated by Palantir for his advisory services.Speaking to Politico about the Bridges report, Jeff Chester, the executive director forthe Center for Digital Democracy, dubbed it a trojan horse  arguing that an attempt to pushfor transatlantic meetings before new policies are formulatedis the same modus operandi as the U.S. proposals on digital trade in the proposed free trade agreement TTIP,currently being negotiated behind closed doors.This[Bridges report]is a backdoor way of supporting a plan by the U.S. government on digital trade that will ultimately weaken the EU data protection regime, Chesteradded.This story was updated with additional comment fromWeitzner and Chester
