Reveal, a startup focused on the mobile-social space, has raised a $1.5 million seed round. The capital eventwas led byResolute Ventures, and participated in byDigital Currency Group and Boost VC, among others.The startups app is notable for two things: Its interesting, and fun question and answer format, and that the company is using a cryptocurrency, backed by its own future incomes, to reward users for their participation in the applications community. In the future, according to Reveal,coins that users accumulate will be salable to advertisers, thereby absorbing some of those monies.Its actually a fun idea: The sooner you get into Reveal the more coin you pick up for using the service. Its a neat way toincentivize early adoption.The cryptocurrency, Reveal Coin, is similar to bitcoin, but is instead controlled by the company. Like bitcoin, there is a limited supply of the stuff, to quote a release from the startup.I dug the Reveal idea, so I dragooned the founding team into TechCrunch HQ here in San Francisco to chat about the app, and figure out where the hell they got their idea.
