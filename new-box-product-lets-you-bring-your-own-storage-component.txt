For several years, Box CEO Aaron Levie has been trying to get people to understand his company is not in the storage business. To drive that point home Boxannounced Box Zonestoday, a product that lets customers choosea storage component from another vendor, enablingcustomers to store files in-country whentheir privacy lawsrequire it.Box is actually announcing the product today, while rolling out a Beta in May. Initially it will work onAmazon Web Services in Ireland, Germany, Japan and Singapore, but the plan is to expand that over time adding new zones usingIBM data centers later this year. Eventually Box hopesto make it flexible enough to add any approved storage you like.The productwill allow customers in Asia, the Middle East and Europe withlegal and regulatory requirements to store their content in-country using third-party storage, and still use the Box service and everything else it brings to the table.In order to make it as simple as possible, Box is taking care of the billing relationship with its partner vendors and giving customers a single invoice. You will pay for Box Zones, but you dont have to think about storage differently than how we think about it today, Levie said.Storage has always been a means to an end for Levie, so perhaps it shouldnt come as a surprise that hes giving customers a choice now. This is a big deal because it truly lets the world know Box is not about storage, but the underlying platform, a point Levie madeto TechCrunch in an interview in September, 2014: Storage is just a piece of the content management puzzle, not the business model, he said.Its another way for Box to pursuenew business opportunities where in-countrystoragerequirements might have limited its markets. Since Box went public just over a year ago it has seen its stock price fluctuate wildly as investors seem to have had a hard time wrapping their arms around the companysbusiness strategy.To answer critics,Box has broughtnew products to market including Box Enterprise Key Management, a product that enables customers to control their own encryption keys and a vertical strategy to deliver a set of products with third-party partners specific to the needs of a givenindustry.Todays announcement isa clear signal for those who still dont understand the Box business model, that this market ismuch more thanpure storage.This is yet another creative way for the company to differentiate itself, while expanding its marketsacross the world without having to invest in data centers or run up againstlocal laws.Its worth noting thatthe data travels briefly through the Box service where encryption and metadata processing happen. Levie calledthis is transient or ephemeral processing. The actual storage takes place locally and thats what should bekey to regulators, he explained.
