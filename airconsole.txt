Gamers with a penchant for old school gaminghave another platform to add to their entertainment mix: AirConsole is a recently launched browser-based games platform that repurposesplayers smartphones as controllers.Theres no need to download any games or apps  or indeed, hunt out your Nintendo 64 and rememberwhere you left the controllers For a local multiplayer gaming session AirConsole issuper simple to use  you just goto AirConsole.com on your computer and smartphone, entering the link code thats shown on the bigger screen onyour smaller screen  et voila,yourphonebecomes the touch pad to control the goings-on on the other screen. Neat.The number of games is pretty limited at this nascent stage, but the team behind AirConsoleis currently running a competition for devs to port titles (they say any browser-based game or Unity3d game can be ported).In the meanwhile titles include TicTac Boom, Hit Parade and PolyRacer. Theres also an NES emulator, plus card gamessuch as poker and Cards Against Humanity.Of courseAirConsole isnot going to entice pro gamers. But its not trying to; its squarely targeting the casual social gaming crowd. Add to which, its cross platform and cross device  so you dont need specific hardware to get a gaming session up and running.The platformhas been baggingearly attention on Redditwhere one of its gamedevelopers describes it thus:it doesnt need a lot of hardware: An average laptop will do. You wont be able to play the newest AAA games with it, but thats also not really what were all about. AirConsole is to play a few quick games with friends while having a beer. Think Mario Party. Except its really annoying to carry an N64 with 8 controllers (or a big gaming PC with 8 gamepads) somewhere, while AirConsole just needs a laptop or TV with a couple of smartphones, and youre all good to play with as many people as you like.Latency can bea slight issue with the link between computer and smartphone, dependingon the deviceyoure using asa controller (AirConsole claims the experience is better usingAndroid phones than iPhones  noting thatdevices that support WebRTC having latencies of between 1 and 10 milliseconds, whilethose without WebRTC support lag between40 to 120 milliseconds). But given the old school gaming vibe its not necessary a big deal to havesporadic delays in gameplay.N-Dream, the Zurich, Switzerland based startup behind AirConsole, started work on the concept back in January,withjust under $1.4 million in initial capital  going on to launch the platform early last month (just before Apple took the wraps off its new Apple TV, which includes a touch-sensitive remote that doubles as a game controller).
