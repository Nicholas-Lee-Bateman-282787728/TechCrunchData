There are few things in this (first) world that are worse than trying to cancel your Internet and cable service.In fact, Comcast has folks that are dedicated solely to the mission of retaining those who wish to graze in other Internet pastures, complete with a guidebook on how to keep a customer on the phone and persuade them to keep their Comcast service. We have seen this go horribly awry.Even in the best-case scenario, youre stuck arguing with a stranger over something you no longer want or need for far longer than you want.But a service called Airpaper is looking to take that mess off of your hands for the relatively cheap price of $5.All you have to do is offer your name, address, phone number and Comcast account number and Airpaper will make that nasty phone call for you. The company promises it wont use your information for any reason other than to cancel your service, but its worth noting that handing over so much personal data to a third party is never 100 percent safe.That said, Id still pay $5 to have someone else handle the the process of canceling my Comcast service.[via Geek.com]
