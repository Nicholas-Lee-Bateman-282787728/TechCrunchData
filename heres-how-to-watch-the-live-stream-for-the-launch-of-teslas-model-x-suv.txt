Tesla has a press announcement scheduled at their campus in Fremont tonight, and theyre not being too coy about the subject matter: its the Model X, the electric SUV theyve been working on for years. Hell, they just went ahead and called the event Model X Launch on the invite.Want to watch it live as it happens? Alas, theres no embeddable live stream that weve found so far  but theyve got a placeholder page up here. The event is scheduled to start at 8 pm. Well be watching too!
