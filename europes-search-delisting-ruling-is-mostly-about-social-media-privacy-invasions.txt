Its one year since the European Court of Justice made Wikipedias Jimmy Wales spit out his breakfast crumpet and spew crumbs of outrage all over the Internet.I am of course talking about the so-called Right to be forgotten ruling (rtbf) which extendsEuropean citizens personaldata protection rights over search engine results by judging the latter data controllers, given the hierarchies of information their proprietary, closed-box algorithmsgenerate.For the past year, private citizens in European have the right to request that inaccurate, outdated or erroneous information that is served in a search result for their own name be delisted from said search. NB: No source material is removed from the Internet; the ruling purely relates to searchresultsreturned for private individuals names (public figures arent afforded the same rights if thereis a public interest in knowing whateverinformation they want delisted  so there are some complex value judgements required to weigh up individual requests).Google has fought toothand nail against the ruling  which is entirely unsurprising, given it threatens its commercial mission of organizing the worlds information and serving ads against it. Despite itsopposed, Google set up an online process to accept and process requests last year  but given its a legal requirement it didnt have a great deal of choice.That said, Google is still resisting expanding search delisting to the Google.com domain, as European data protection regulators would like it to  currently only applying delisting decisions to European sub-domains. So get your popcorn for a future fight there.RTBF dataReputation VIP, an online reputation management company which in June last year set up a helper service for Europeanswanting to file requests with search engines, has just released some new data to coincide withthe anniversary of the ruling noting that it has sent just over 61,500 URLs to Google since it opened the Forget.me site on June 24.In the first three months of the service being live it notes that Google received an average of 1,500 requests per day. In the last three months the rate of requests was averaging 500 per day  which it notes represents around 180,000 requests per year. So you certainly cant say theres no appetite for the rtbf.Google has also stepped up the rate at which it processes requests over the past year, with Reputation VIP charting a reduction in time taken per request  from 56 days last June to 16 days back in March, although this rate has fluctuated (but its not an exact science  Googles Eric Schmidt himself bemoaned the fact that it was not the sort of process that willeverlikely be automated).Mountain View didrelease some details about how itprocesses rtbf requests last August. However it has been less forthcoming about releasing substantial data about thecontent of requests  so the types of informationthat typically gets delisted. Thus far its offered a few sample examples/anecdotes, making it hard to quantify and evaluate the value judgements and public interest decisions Googleis making.Reputation VIP notes that Googles rate of refusal of rtbf requests has stabilized at 70 percent per month since January. Albeit this is a sharp increase on its initial rate when a minority (43 percent) of requests were refused. (On its ownTransparency Report Google notes it has received a total of more than 250,000 requests since the rtbf ruling, and refused almost 59 percent of them.)While Google has been reluctant to detail aggregated categories of requests, Reputation VIP has analyzed requests filed via its service toshed some light on the types of information European want delisted. It notes the predominant category by far remains invasion of privacy  such as the disclosure of privateaddresses and religious or political affiliations against a persons will. The next largest motivator for making a request is reputation damage:Much of the criticism of the rtbf has centered on fears of criminals erasing bad behavior  leading to cries of censorship. But thisdata suggests those fears mischaracterize the mainstay of rtbf requests, withlegal proceedings only accounting for a marginal 3.1 percent of URLs, according to Reputation VIP.The media has also oftenbeen hugely critical of the ruling, arguing it threatens press freedom and freedom of expression yet again this data suggests those fears mischaracterize what the rtbf is mostly being used for. Its being used byprivate individuals, whose quotidianconcerns wouldnt make itinto the press anyway, even if they have been posted to social media sites like Facebook.Wikimedia  the organization which runs the Wikipedia online encyclopedia has also been massively critical of the rtbf, dubbing it a threat to its mission last year. However according to this data just 0.2 percent of URLs  or some 57URLs  have pertained to information on Wikipedia over the past year:In terms of reasons for Google refusing a rtbf request, Reputation VIPs data flags up that the primary reasons for delisting refusals are thatthe data concerns a persons professional activity  which presumably weighs in on the public right to know balance requirement of the ruling  followed by the requester themselves being the originator of the data:
