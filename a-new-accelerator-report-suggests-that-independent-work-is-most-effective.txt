Today, a $2.3 million private-public partnership called the Global Accelerator Learning Initiative (GALI) is releasing itsfirst major report,in collaboration with Village Capital, a seed-stage accelerator that operates development programs for early-stage entrepreneurs around the world.Led by the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE), the goal of GALIis to determine how effective accelerator programs really are and how to develop best practices in different regions, given there are roughly500now dotting the globe.In fact, oneof the biggest questions it is trying to address is whether accelerators work as well for developing-world entrepreneursas they do for those in the developed world.In ways, its a little soon to be releasing anything. GALI, whose new report examines15Village Capital programs, is just nine months in the making. Though its an interesting data set  the report examines the performance of entrepreneurs who were enrolled in thoseVillage Capitalprograms from 2013 to 2014againstthose who applied but were not accepted  its a very limited one.Still, it claims to see some signals that might help entrepreneurs who are weighing whether or where to join an accelerator. For one thing, it says that participants in the Village Capital program saw outside investmentthat dwarfed those ofrejected entrepreneurs by eight times.In a call last week, Randall Kempner, the executive director ofANDE, said researchers werent yet sure if that disparity owes to better entrepreneurs being accepted by Village Capital; by entrepreneurs creating better companies because of their learnings at Village Capital; or whether by working with Village Capital, the entrepreneurs enjoyed a halo effect from its brand, thus making it easier to attract outside funding.The report also finds some interesting programmatic differences between the highest versus thelowest-performing Village Capitalprograms, including that the highest-performing programs emphasized more time for independent work. Specifically, says the report, the percentage of time spent working on-site or remotely with other entrepreneurs or mentors in the program (versus time whenthe founders work on their own) was 53 percent of the time for the highest-performing program, versus 83 percent for the low-performing programs.In another potentially interesting twist, the report says that Village Capitals highest-performing programs spent less timeworking on finance, accounting, andformal business plan development and more time on presentation and communication skills, networking, andorganization structure and design, suggesting it makes sense to spend more time on softer skills.The reports authors acknowledge that the study theyre releasing today isfar from conclusive. In fact, it features as many predictions as it does findings.But certainly, its effort is worth watching. As explainsSaurabh Lall,research director at ANDE and one of the reports lead authors, Theres been a tremendous proliferation of accelerators and incubators around the world, but while exciting, were concerned that we dont have a good sense of whether they do a good job at supporting entrepreneurs in emerging markets. From our perspective, [this work] intends to help us answer: do they work, under which circumstances, and which programs are more likely to work for certain entrepreneurial segments.We want to be truth tellers, addsKempner. There hasnt been nearly enough research done in this space, so a lot of people can say a lot of things that may or may not be true. We think well eventually have enough information thatwe will.For much more, you can view both an executive summary as well as the full report right here.Photo above: Monterrey, Mexico, site of one of Village Capitals programs
