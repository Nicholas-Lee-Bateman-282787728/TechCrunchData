Google is updating its Android Studio developer environment with a whole slew of upgrades under the hood thatll make it faster. The company unveiled the new tool at its Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View.Making the developer experience easier is critical to companies like Google to encourage developers to build apps Android-first, which is important to capture moments of exclusivity over the App Store. That could, in the end, convince people to go for Android devices before an iPhone or iPad  and its all riding on which app store has the best apps.Heres whats new under the hood:These all appear to be a lot of under-the-hood upgrades, but again, these kinds of upgrades are critical for convincing developers to stick with Android Studio as their go-to IDE. 92% of applications on the Google Play store are built using Android Studio, the company said.Developers can pick up the beta version today.
