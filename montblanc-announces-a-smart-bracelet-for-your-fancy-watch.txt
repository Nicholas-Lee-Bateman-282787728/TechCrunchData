What did I tell you? In a last-ditch effort to save themselves, watchmakers are now turning to the band in order to ensure that timekeeping remains well in the realm of the mechanical.The new band, part of the Montblanc Timewalker Urban Speed collection, is a little metal screen that can receive notifications and messages. From A Blog To Watch:
I fully expect this to be the stupidest thing ever, on par with the Prada phone, and this shows exactly what companies like Montblanc are up against. Wearables are replacing some watches and the Apple Watch will replace the rest. I expect that the mechanical watch manufacturers will soon be facing a massive slowdown at best and bankruptcy at worst.Dont worry, though: you can buy the Montblanc band separately for about $300 (the mechanical watches are about $3,000) so you can strap it to your Apple Watch.
