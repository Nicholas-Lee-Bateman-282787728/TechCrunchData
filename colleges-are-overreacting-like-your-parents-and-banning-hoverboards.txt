Surprise, surprise! If you buy cheapoff-brandelectronics from a shoddy factory in Asia, they may have poorly-designedlithium-ion batteries that can catch fire.After nearly 60 airlines basicallybanned hoverboards overnight, college campuses are now jumping on the hoverboard hate bandwagon.Over a dozen colleges have banned the two-wheel devices (that dont actually hover), with the latest being Georgetown University.In a letter to students today, Georgetowns COO explained their rationale:Based on these reported safety risks and as a precaution, do NOT bring hoverboards or self-balancing scooters to campus. Until the Consumer Product Safety Commission makes a determination on the safety of these devices, we areprohibitingtheir use or storage on our campus. We continue to encourage the proper use of other transportation means for daily life, including bicycles.NowI want to make it clear that Ifind faux hoverboards pretty dumb and, while fun to ride, I make a fool of myself every timeI ride one.However, that being said, this new trend of banning hoverboards is an overreactionand shows that people dont really understand how gadgets work.Do these colleges know that hoverboards arent the only gadgets that can be made with faulty, cheap lithium-ion batteries, and other devices like cameras, phones, and laptops also occasionally blow up? If you want to ban off-brand hoverboards, why not just ban all off-brand electronics?As of three weeks ago, the U.S Consumer Protection Safety Commission has discovered 12 cases of hoverboards catching fire. Considering millions of devices were sold this holiday season alone, 12 isnt exactly an epidemic.That being said, I understand that hoverboards with cheap lithium-ion batteries are bad, and that any risk of fire or explosion is serious stuff.But, instead of causing FUD and banning them from your college campus (which, lets be real, will probably lead to more students using them), why notbe realistic and find a better solution to the problem, like actually helping your students figure out if their hoverboards are shoddy or legit?/rant
