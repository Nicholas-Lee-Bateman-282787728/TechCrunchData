Salesforce made its name originally with cloud-based software to help salespeople manage their leads and close deals; and today the company took a big step into the business of sales itself. Today the company announced that it would spend $2.8 billion to acquire Demandware, a cloud-based provider of e-commerce services to businesses big and small. The deal also will spearhead a new business division: the Salesforce Commerce Cloud.Demandware went public in 2012, and Salesforce says that it willcommence a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Demandware for $75.00 per share, in cash. This is a big premium on the companys current valuation which was $1.87 billion at close of trade yesterday. The transaction is expected to close in SalesforcesQ22017, which endsJuly 31, 2016.Demandware is an amazing companythe global cloud leader in the multi-billion dollar digital commerce market, said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO, Salesforce, in a statement. With Demandware, Salesforce will be well positioned to deliver the future of commerce as part of our Customer Success Platform and create yet another billion dollar cloud.Something else amazing about Demandware: how it has grown. Thecompany had raised a mere $54 million when it was still a startup, mostly from only three investors, by the looks of it. Its revenues in the last quarter, however, are more modest: according to its most recent quarterly earnings, reported at the end of April, revenues were only $67 million, with net loss just under $12 million, but the former is growing while the latter continues to shrink.This is a massivedeal for Salesforce for a few reasons, and not just because of the price.First, the acquisitiongrowsthe funnel for the company: it extends the types of contractsthat Salesforce can forgewith existing customers (longtime Marketing Cloud or CRM customers now can be upsold on larger deals that include commerce services).It also gives Salesforcea new group of customers to upsell for the other services that italready offered,from marketing and online analytics through to back-office software for sales and other IT functions. Demandware customers includeDesign Within Reach, Lands End, LOreal and Marks & Spencer, the company said.More interestingly, italso opens up Salesforce to competition with the likes of Shopify, Amazon, eBay and its former service Magento. This groupnot only provides third parties with commerce software, but some (specifically Amazon and eBay)also wantto be the go-to platforms for transactions.E-commerce isa hugearea that was one of the first big businesses to gain traction online when people first started going on the web, and it continues to grow as the idea of spending money virtually, and giving users an omnicommerce experience, both become ever more commonplace.Gartner estimates that worldwide spending on digital commerce platforms is expected to grow at over 14 percent annually, reaching $8.544 billion by 2020, according to figures provided by Salesforce.Salesforce says its new Commerce Cloud will be an integral part of Salesforces Customer Success Platform, creating opportunities for companies to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Salesforce customers will have access to the industrys leading enterprise cloud commerce platform, and Demandwares customers will be able to leverage Salesforces leading sales, service, marketing, communities, analytics, IoT and platform solutions to deliver a more comprehensive, personalized consumer experience.
