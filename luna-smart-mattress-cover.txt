Luna co-founder Matteo Franceschetti presents a pretty appealing vision of what it can be like to go to bed: As you lie down, the lights, temperature (of both the bed and the room), and the music all adjust to a setting of your choice. Then as you fall asleep, they adjust again, perhaps turning off completely.Luna makes this possible through a smart mattress cover thats now available for pre-order through a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.As you can see in the video above, Luna is a cover that fits over your mattress. It then automatically tracks your sleep, sending the data to both the Luna app and to other Internet-connected devices at home.In the Luna showroom, Franceschetti actually feigned sleep and we saw the room go to sleep around him. The company is touting its integration with the Nest smart thermometer, but Franceschetti said it has signed partnerships with other smart home devices as well. (Nonetheless, I suspect that some of the selling points, like brewing coffee as you wake up, may be a little further down the road.)Our idea is to really automatize most of your sleep habits, he said, later adding, The more Internet devices will be distributed and sold across the United States, the more this product will be useful.Asked about the most noticeable change in sleep habits as a result of Luna, Franceschetti replied:For men, the most exciting part is our interaction with smart home devices  so the lights, your Netflix, Spotify. For women, instead, its temperature we have seen most of the couple they fight about temperature while men love to sleep cold while women love to sleep hot and through the different temperature and zone control, its something we can solve.In a follow-up email, the Luna team also filled me in on how it protects your sleep data. The company said that the data it collects is aggregated locally, on the device, then encrypted and sent to Luna for storage and analysis.The planned retail price for Lunas smart cover is $249, but its currently available for $179 through pre-order.
