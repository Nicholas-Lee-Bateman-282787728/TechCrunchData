Remember Edward Snowden?For many Americans who talked to John Oliveron Last Week Tonight, the answer is no.Its been almost two years since the world was captivated by Snowdens leaks to The Guardian and The Washington Post about American surveillance programs. For weeks it seemed there was a new headline everyday aboutanother previously classified surveillance program or another government official calling for action on this issue. Presidential review groups were called.President Obama called for major changes to the programs.Although the Snowden leaks certainly proved to be much more than a three-day story, American surveillance practices remain largelythe same two years later.The main difference is this issue no longer dominatesour political discourse. In November, the FREEDOM Act  legislation under development for two years that would have overhauled NSA surveillance programs died in a Senate procedural vote to little display.Last night we found out Olivers HBO program was off last week because he was in Russia interviewing the most famous hero and/or traitor in recent American history. Oliver hit on many points that have been lacking in past interviews with the former government contractor  from whether Snowden misses Hot Pockets to whether hes actually read all of the documents hes released to reporters (Snowden maintained he understands the scope of the documents).Olivers interview is timelyas we approach an importantdeadline for surveillance reform on June 1. In response to the public outcry that followed the Snowden revelations, President Obama stipulated that congress must renew or reform the Patriot Act provision authorizing the bulk collection of Americans phone records by that date, or else the program will expire. Online this morning, Twitter, Reddit and the expectedpublicationswere abuzz with how John Oliver killed it and or slayed it in this new segment.So John Oliver didnt ~destroy~ anything last night. He just interviewed Snowden. Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) April 6, 2015Despite what network news chose to lead with, the interviewssignificance extends beyond Snowden sayingyou should keep sending dirty pictures.Its important because millions of people who havent thought about surveillance reform in monthsare going to click on this YouTube video and care about it again.Last summer we saw Olivers ability to captivate the publics attention when it came to the complex, technical issue of net neutrality. His commentary prompted tens of thousands to submit comments to the Federal Communications Commission, helping net neutralityreceive more public input than any other FCC docket itemthat came before it. In just 13 minutes, Oliver helped changethe future of the Internet.So what will the 33 minutes he spent on government surveillance reform do?TheFREEDOM Acts failure last year can largely be attributed to a lack of public support and understanding. If the average voter doesnt know the name Edward Snowden, how can they be expected to know about Section 215 of the Patriot Act?Ever able to make us laugh about even the driest news topics, Oliverchanged the topic of discussion from vague hypotheticals about civil liberties to something tangible he knew many Americans would care about  dick pics.Well the good news is theres no program named, the dick pic program,' Snowden said. The bad news is they are still collecting everybodys information, including your dick pics.Snowden then went on to explain how the government uses different programs to access those pictures, from Executive Order 12333 to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.He was able to explain confusing provisions of American surveillance law in just a few sentences.Hopefully as this debate returns to Washington and weturn to more serious conversations about surveillance reform, Olivers jokes will keep Americans engaged and calling on their representatives to act on surveillance reform.
