In a letter sent Wedesdayto Google CEO Sundar Pichai, U.S. SenatorAl Franken (D-Minn.) sought to raise questions regarding Googles use of data gathered from their EdTech initiatives.While I commend Googles foray into education technology (EdTech), I am concerned about the extent to which Google may be collecting K-12 students personal data and using that information for non-educational purposes without parents knowledge or consent.A report from the Electronic Foundation Frontier (EFF)surfaced last month suggestedthat the data being gathered by Googles educational programs (used in schools by over 50 million students) was being used to track students.The EFF allegedthatGoogles Chromebook and Google Apps for Education (GAFE) had been deceptively tracking students and had been storing student activities taking place on all of Googles products and had been doing all of this by default. More so, the EFF alleged that the companys actions had violated the Student Privacy Pledge, which Google has signed.Sen. Franken touched on these reports and expressed concerns that the company was violating the privacy of students in schools across the country.I understand that there may be a discrepancy in how Google treats student data obtained through its core Google Apps for Education (GAFE) services  products that are deemed educational  versus how Google treats student data obtained through other Google services that are not deemed educational, such as Google Search, Google Maps, or YouTube. As a result, Google may be tracking and storing students Internet browsing activity, passwords, and video viewing behavior when a student is logged in to their GAFE account or using a Google Chromebook but isnt actually using GAFE services. I am concerned that this collection of data may enable Google to create detailed profiles of the students and ultimately target advertising to them or use the profiles for other non-educational purposes without the students knowledge. Furthermore, I understand that unless a school administrator bars students from accessing non-GAFE services, users may have limited ability to consent to this collection of data or its possible use for non-educational purposes.Google responded to the claims of misuse of student data in a post fromJonathan Rochelle, Director of Google Apps for Education, who wrote that, While we appreciate the EFFs focus on student data privacy, we are confident that our tools comply with both the law and our promises, including theStudent Privacy Pledge, which we signed earlier this year.Still, Sen. Franken had a laundry list of questions for Google to answer, largely focused on the type of data being collected and whether that information was being shared with third-parties or being used to target ads at students.The full list of questions he asked in the letter is listed below:
