Google Calendar is having issues this morning, so if you dont know what meetings you have and where you are supposed to be, youre not alone.As far as we can see, the outage started sometime around 8:15am Pacific this morning and Google acknowledged it shortly after that. It seems like Calendar is down completely for quite a large number of users, but in my own experience, the issue is intermittent.Update: Google says service has now been restored for some users. The company expects the service to be back up for everybody by 10:30am Pacific Time.Its pretty unusual for Calendar to have a major outage, but theCalendar team also had to wrestle with some notifications issues last month.For the time being, enjoy your mimosa and know that whoever you were supposed to meetis probably wrestling with the same issues.We will update this post once we hear more.
