Microsoft kicked off June with news that Windows 10 will ship on July 29, just a little under two months from now. The next big update for MS is designed as a unifying platform that will offer continuity across mobile, desktop, tablets and even the Xbox One gaming console, and it will be a free upgrade for Windows 7 and 8 users for the first year. To help ensure easy updates (and probably as a way to try to get a large installed base of Windows 10 users right away), Microsoft is also using a reservation system that allows users to sign up to be notified when the update is available, and to schedule it to install when you want.A big new feature addition for Windows 10 is Cortana, so heres a message the company prepared from its virtual assistant ant announcing the news.What else do you get? Well Im glad you asked  heres a quick look at the highlights:Microsoft is doing everything it can to make the transition smooth, like ensuring itll work with your existing applications. Windows 8 was sort of an awkward generation, so heres hoping the skipped numeral results in something that suits everyones needs.
