Media management software Plex is making big strides after eking out a niche for itself as an app beloved by a dedicated but specialized audience for years. The app now has presence on two of the three major modern home consoles, and its debut on those platforms included a re-thinking of its approach to content discovery. A new version of the app coming today for Roku continues the work started with those apps, with a new user experience that not only does more to surface your own librarys best content and hidden gems, but also offers trailers, behind-the-scenes clips and more.Plexs app on Roku is generally ranked among the top five on the platform in terms of usage, and this should help it continue to find a place in the hearts of users. The redesign brings parity with the versions Plex has already debuted on Xbox and PlayStation, as well as some smart TVs, opting for a horizontal scrolling interface that gives you access to stuff youre already watching, or next episodes in series youre actively viewing, but also provides other kinds of collections that might let you locate some shows youve been leaving out of the mix. Extras also makes sure your collection more closely resembles boxed DVDs and Blu-rays in terms of extras, no matter where you source your content and allowing you to stay all-digital.The updated user interface should eventually roll out to other platforms beyond those where it currently appears, Plex has told me in the past, so keep an eye on your media PC, since it is indeed a vastly improved navigation experience more suited to lean-back viewing than the previous, arguably more early-adopter and tech enthusiast-friendly browsing paradigm.
