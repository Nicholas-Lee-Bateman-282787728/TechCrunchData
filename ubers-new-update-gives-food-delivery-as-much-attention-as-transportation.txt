Uber is quietly rolling out an update today where Uber Eats (Ubers prepared food delivery service available in NYC, Los Angeles, Toronto, Austin, Chicago, and Barcelona) is getting a major facelift.First noticed by analysts at Cowen, the update changes where Uber Eats is listed in the app.While previously bundled in withoptions like UberX and UberPOOL, Uber Eats is now a separate button at the top of the screen,completely independent of transportation.While the move doesnt change any of the actual functionality of Uber Eats, it definitely showsthat the company isgetting serious about food delivery.This move by Uber could beananother attempt toget more users to try Eats, especially those who may not have previously noticed the feature.Notably, thecompany is offering free delivery in NYC all month long (normally a $4 charge), which seems like it will help entice users to try the service.As weve written about before, a large part of Ubers future success (and valuation) depends on its ability to turn its driversinto a delivery fleet. The first step is naturally expanding its own in-house delivery product, even if it is just to show retailers that it can achieve fast and reliable delivery atscale.When asked for comment, an Uber spokesperson said the following about the new feature.The new interface is available in UberEats cities. The layout separates RIDES from EATS and creates a more seamless, intuitive experience across services. We are always experimenting to find new, creative ways to make the Uber app more user friendly.
