Fresh air is a concept most often associated with the great outdoors. Dyson is looking to make your home nature fresh by ridding it of indoor pollutants with the Pure Cool Link purifier fan.Hopefully, the engineering that went into James Dysons new gadget is better than the branding.Thecompanys proposed ingenuity is that the Pure Cool Link is a smart device, equipped with a360 Glass HEPA filter, with connectivity via the Dyson Link app for iOS or Android.Users will be able to monitor interior and exterior air quality (viaBreezoMeter data), while also adjusting the settings on the fan or keeping history on the environment.For those who lead busy lives (or just arent into constantly monitoring air quality), the Pure Cool Linkalso has an auto mode available, which activates the purifier at different times in order to combatfluctuatingoxygen quality.Dyson also claims their purifier removes99.97% of pollutants and allergens from the air  we would definitely need to test that.The bladeless fan and air purifier goes on sale today via direct and partner retailers for $499; indeed, clean interior air can now be considered the by-product of (working) technology.Its worth noting that similar offerings from competitors are considerably less expensive,like Coways air purifier($250), and is even vouched for by a formerNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist. So, there is that to consider.
