If youre a fan of craft beer, you might be tempted to try homebrewing  if only it wasnt (to quote my colleague Ryan Lawler) a pain in the ass.Startup PicoBew has built a machine called Zymatic that should make the process a lot easier, automating the brewing process and making it more consistent. PicoBrews Greg White even pitched it (half-jokingly, I think) as an Internet of Beer device: The Internet of Things was so last week.Its all cloud based, too, he said, adding, We actually have recipe crafters, recipes libraries online. You pull recipes from the cloud to your machine. Theres a little bit of AI in the crafter, too, so it can solve your taste preferences, filling in ingredients. Every 60 seconds its dialing home telling us the health of your brew.The initial steps, including mashing, takes about three hours, followed by days or weeks of fermenting, depending on the recipe.The Zymatic machine is currently available for preorder  its $1,699 for just the machine, or $1,799 with a keg. As for obtaining the ingredients, White said that many home brewers already have their favorite shops, though PicoBrew can also provide recommendations.And yes, when Ryan and I swung by the PicoBrew booth at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this week, they did have some beer behind the counter. Im not a connoisseur, so I cant give you a detailed description of the taste  but I certainly enjoyed sampling some good beer in the middle of all the CES madness.
