Dont tell my bosses, who much prefer me to write scoops, but my favorite part of my job is hosting the TechCrunch Meetups in various cities across the country. And dont tell all the people I work with who are from San Francisco, but my favorite city in the world is the one I live in, New York City.Normally Im pretty good at keeping secrets. My job depends on it. But this one is just too awesome to keep from blurting out:The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off in New York is going to be sick.Well be hanging out at Le Poisson Rouge, which is one of the coolest little venues in the city, on August 18. Doors open at 6pm, and the Pitch-off officially begins at 7 p.m.Well have a very special guest (who is a huge frickin deal) join us for some opening remarks about the state of the NYC tech scene, and some equally awesome judges join us on stage. All of them will be revealed in due time.Ten companies, who have yet to be determined, will hit up the stage to deliver a pitch in 60seconds or fewer, and the judges will weigh and measure them until theyve decided on a winner.First place gets a table in the Startup Alley at TC Disrupt SF in September. Second place receives two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner will get one ticket to the big show.Dont tell my mom, but Ill probably get a little tipsy. And so will all the brilliant folks who buy tickets to attend the show (so 21+ please).If you think you want to be in the pitch-off, applications are open until Friday, July 24.Tickets to attend the show are $25 and can be found here.
