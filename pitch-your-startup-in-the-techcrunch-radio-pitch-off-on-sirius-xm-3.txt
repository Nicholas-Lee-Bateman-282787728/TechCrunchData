If youre a reader of TechCrunch (which, at least right now, you are), then you might be interested to know that about the TechCrunch Radio show on Sirius XM. Each Tuesday at 6pm ET (3pm PT), John Biggs and I go live on Sirius XM Insight 121 for one hour to discuss the latest in tech news and startups, including a weekly TechCrunch Radio Pitch-off. Each week, we select five companies to participate in the contest, giving each exactly one minute to pitch their product live to a panel of judges. After each pitch well ask a few questions and then deliberate live to decide on the winner. Its always a lot of fun, but we cant get it done without amazing entrepreneurs. At the very least, we hope you listen in to the show weekly on Sirius XM either live or on-demand through the Sirius XM app, but if youre a startup looking to build awareness, you should definitely consider applying to be a part of the pitch-off. Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome.
3. You must be able to pitch your product with your words only.
4. You must be able to operate a telephone.Apply:Apply here.Its going to be a hoot!Each week, TechCrunch Radio will air Tuesdays at 6:00 pm ET with a replay at 6:00 pm PT, drive time for both coasts, on Sirius XM Insight, channel 121, and through the SiriusXM Internet Radio App on smartphones and other connected devices, as well as online at siriusxm.com.
