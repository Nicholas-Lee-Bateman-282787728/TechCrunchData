Quantum computing company D-Wave Systems announced today that it raised a $29 million (CAD) round of funding in late 2014.This followsthe $28.4 million it brought in last summer and ~$2.2 million raised in November.The round brought in cash from several previous investors and a large institutional investor that D-Wave declined to name in its release or in follow-up emails.The new funding gives D-Wave more room to expand its hardware and software efforts. On the processor side of things, the company is developing its next-gen 1,000 qubit system, which should have an easier time of demonstrating the benefits of using quantum computing than its 512 qubit predecessor.If it hopes to sell any more processors, D-Wave Systems also needs clients like Google and NASA to build software that takes advantage of quantum annealing. Thats uncharted territory for most software engineers, so D-Wave has to work with its customers to demonstrate that there is in fact an advantage to buying quantum hardware.While it holds the title of first-to-market, D-Wave is no longer the only quantum hardware company in town. Last summer, Y Combinator-backed Rigetti Computing raised $2.5 million for its own commercial quantum-computing platform.
