Intel announced overnightin a company blog postthat it has purchased Israeli company Replay Technologies. The company provides an unusual 3D video renderingcapability it callsfree dimensional or freeD video, according to Intel.While the technology could potentially have abroader usage than sports broadcasting, it has been used to-date to enablefans to get a 360 degree view of key plays and was particularly useful at the NBA All-Star Weekendrecently where it was on display for the popular Slam Dunk contest.One of the reasons that Intel is so interested in this company is that its not just cool technology, its compute-intensive. It takes a bunch of servers running Intel chips to make it work. In fact, to make the 3D broadcasting magic happen at the NBA All-Star Game,Replaycreated a seamless 3-D video rendering of the court using 28 ultrahigh-definition cameras positioned around the arena and connected to Intel-based servers, a lot of Intel servers.A freeD control room at a recent sporting event.

As weve seen with the NBA All-Star Weekend, Super Bowl 50 and other large high-profile sporting events recently, the networks and leagues are looking for new ways to engage fansand keepus interested in their events. Replay Technologies represents one way to ensure we continue watching, sharing and talking aboutwhat were seeing, regardless of the screen we are using.While there wasnt an official price, the Israeli Globes publicationcited sources who pegged the deal at $175 million.In an email, an Intel spokesperson indicated the company would not be revealing the price.If the price is anywhere close to true, it appears to represent a nice return for investors who poured $22.5 million into the company before the acquisition, according to CrunchBase.
