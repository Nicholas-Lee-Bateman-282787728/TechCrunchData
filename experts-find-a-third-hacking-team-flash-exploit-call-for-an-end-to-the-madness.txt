TrendMicro has posted yet another 0day AKA urgent Flash hole that could put your data at risk. The Hacking Team, a group of professional hackers who supplied governments with hacking tools and whose entire information database was recently leaked, used this exploit to attack computers without the users knowledge.The new vulnerability, CVE-2015-5123, follows two other 0day exploits. This exploit, according to Adobe, could cause a crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.There are currently calls to sunset Flash entirely, thereby destroying millions of badgers.Seriously: just disable Flash. You can delete it in Windows here and OS X here. Its not worth the risk.Dear Flash pic.twitter.com/lYnzOAvNF0 InfoSec Taylor (@SwiftOnSecurity) July 13, 2015
