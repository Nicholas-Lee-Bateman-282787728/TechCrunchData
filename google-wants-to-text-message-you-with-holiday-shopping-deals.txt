A number of startups emerged this year to offer consumers an easier way to shop: instead of immersive, e-commerce experiences, companies likeMagic, Operator,Fetch,GoButler, and others, including Facebook, are testing out messaging-based virtual assistants that help you buy nearly anything from airline tickets to dinner reservations, to great gifts, and more. Now Google is getting in on that action, too. The company is currently trialingits own SMS-based alertingservice, this time focusedon helping holiday shoppers find the best deals.The service was spotted in the wild earlier today by the unofficial Google-watching blog, Google Operating System, which saw the optionto subscribe to Black Friday phone deals pop up on their mobile phone after a related search query.However, the new deals servicewas quietly announced by Google earlier this month, by way of a Google+ post. It received a little press coverage at the time, but largely on blogs that only cover Google, search engines or SEO, as opposed to more mainstream attention. That may change as consumers turn to their phones to find Black Friday deals in the days ahead.While framed as something Google is testing during the holidays, the move indicates that even the search giantacknowledges that the way consumers will shop, browse, and transact on mobile devices in the future may end up being radically different from on the desktop web.With our phones, (and now our watches, too), our devices are turning intoalerting platforms that deliver us the information we need, when we need it. And instead of searching and comparing dozens of options, we may simply communicate with an assistant  part human, part AI  who helps narrow down our options, present us with the best choices, then fulfill the request. This is whats called the invisible app market, as weve referred to it here on TechCrunch, and it makes sense given the rise of mobile messaging, combined with the ability to integrate a virtual assistant-powered experience over familiar communication channels like SMS.Googles service today falls far short of a personalized assistant, but the company has already proven with its virtual assistant Google Now that it could expand in this direction, if it choose.But for now,the idea behind the new deal alerting service is to translate theshift in how consumers shop into a new ad format. These deal alerts are actually an AdWords option thats being trialed with a limited number of advertisers, the company explains.Google declined to provide information related to ad pricing, or a list of participating advertisers, given the service is considered to be only a test at this time.However, what we do know is that the alerts are only available on mobile, only in the U.S., and the text messages returned are powered by Google. In fact, Google is creating customized text for those who sign up directly, the company says.Heres how it works:If you search for a general term like black friday deals from your mobile phone, you may see an option that prompts you to subscribe to alerts from a Google ad at the top of your search results. If you choose to do so, your phone number will bekept private, says Google, and youll be able to opt out of the text messages at any time.However, while choosing to use the new alerts service, youll be sent relevant offers from participating retailers across a number of popular holiday shopping categories, like computers, phones, and gaming consoles.The Google Operating System blog happened to spot the text-messaging deal subscription service when they searched for moto x play  indicating that the ads arent only tied to black friday or cyber monday search queries, but to any matching products from participating advertisers.You dont have to wait to see an ad to try out the new service. Google says you can text the word JOIN to the following numbers, depending on what deals you want to see:For Black Friday  847-904-0608 For Cyber Monday  847-906-8958 For Holiday deals  847-904-0596We did experience a few bugs when doing so, though. For example, a link to learn more thats texted back after sign-up redirects you to a broken web page.Google saysthe ads began rolling out earlier this month, following the initial AdWords announcement, but its likely that they were still few and far between until Black Friday neared.If the test is successful, theres potential for Google to expand this service beyond just tracking holiday deals. If consumers opted in, the service could serve as an app-less counterpart to theGoogle Now virtual assistant, pinging you about other relevant e-commerce opportunities based on search history (if you could get pastthe creepy factor of something like that), or you could track product categories or brand names, then be alerted to sales.But its unclear at this time what Google will consider a successful test, or if it has any further plans, if thats the case. Its also unclear if consumers are even interested in a this sort of deals alerting service.After all, the benefit to the other messaging-based commercestartups is thathumantouch. Even when primarily automated, theres a conversational aspect to using therival services, and most will also adapt to your preferences over time. Googles service, for now at least, feels more like opting in to advertisements  as it is  and less like personal assistance.(h/t, image credits: Google+; Google Operating System)
