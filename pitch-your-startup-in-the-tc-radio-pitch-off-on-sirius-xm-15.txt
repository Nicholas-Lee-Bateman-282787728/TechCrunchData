Its Tuesday, which means that TechCrunch Radio is coming to you live this evening on Sirius XM Insight 121. Each week, TC Radio delivers the most exciting tech news to you direct via satellite radio. But thats not all!We also hold a weekly TC Radio pitch-off where five companies get exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product to a panel of judges. After each pitch, judges conduct a quick Q&A and once all the presentations are complete, we deliberate live on the air to determine a winner. If youre an entrepreneur, this is a great way to get some air time for your product and some feedback on your elevator pitch. If youre not an entrepreneur, tune in anyway. To apply to be in the pitch-off, follow the instructions below:Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
