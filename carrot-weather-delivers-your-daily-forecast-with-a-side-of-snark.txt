Carrot, the makers of a suite of sarcastic apps including a to-do list app that berates you for slacking and a weight loss app that shames you about your poor eating choices, has just introduced the latest addition to its lineup: a snarky weather application that delivers your daily forecast with a twist. Like its other apps, Carrot Weatherfeatures a talking bot with a ton of personality, but combines this with high-quality weather data powered by Forecast.io.Thats the same backend that powers the popular weather app Dark Sky, meaning Carrot Weather users have access to weather data like barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, visibility, sunrise and sunset times, the feels like temperature, moon phase, and more, in addition to the daily highs and lows as well as the 7-day forecast.You can also swipe up from the bottom of the app to see a more detailed view of the upcoming weather, including the weekly forecast and other conditions.The app is actually beautifully designed, too, so if youre a fan of minimalist weather apps with a clean presentation, you wont feel like youre missing out if you switch to Carrots more entertaining version.What makes thisnew app fun to use is that itsforecasts are delivered with biting commentary designed to make you laugh. Someones getting frostbite tonight!, it jokes in the dead of winter, for example. Or if youre having a warm, sunny day, the bot might tell you, its pretty nice out. But I promise to bring awful weather soon. Oh jeez, thanks.In addition, the weather forecasts are illustrated with characters and animations that arent entirely typical  like a tornado with sharks flying around it or angry penguins onsnowy days. There are over 100 of these animated scenes, the company says, as well as over 2,000 lines of dialogue.But whats even more clever is that the app includes dozens of secret locations that you can unlock just by using the app more, or by searching for specific cities to add. (For example, try Cupertino.)These locations include places like the moon or Apples R&D Labs, as well as pop culture references to things like House of Cards, Star Wars or Silence of the Lambs. The apps creator says that these were originally just going to be Easter eggs that appeared when the app experienced an error, but he later decided to turn them into a full feature because they were so much fun.Carrot Weather is currently a $2.99 download on iTunes.
