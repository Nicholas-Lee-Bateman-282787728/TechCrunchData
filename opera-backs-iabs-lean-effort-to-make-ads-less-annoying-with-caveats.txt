After adding a built-in ad-blocker to its desktop browser back in March, Opera stepped into and stepped up the debate about online ad-blocking.The company has argued killing ads makes for a better consumer browsing experience, flagging up faster speeds and lower data consumption gleaned once ads are stripped away, and arguing generally that ads have become one of the major annoyances of web browsing.It has also just now started the rollout of its ad-blocker to its suite of mobile browsers, beginning with Opera Mini for Android. So its stuckto its guns thus far, despite taking some flak from publishers and, inevitably, the ad industry, for its decision to default switch on ad-blocking for its users.But as my TC colleague Frederic Lardinois has pointed out, there are a few odd notes here  not least that Opera itself owns an online advertising firm (Opera Mediaworks). It is also in the process of, albeit perhapsunwillingly, being acquired by a consortium of Chinese companies thatincludes severaladcompanies.Whatever Operas multi-threaded motivations, it has now thrown the ad industry a bit of a bone  with the promise of juicier meat, should itshow it can trulyreform its wayswhen it comes to key consumer issues such aspage load speeds, pagebloat, privacy and general ad trickery/annoyance.Ina blog postyesterday, Operas SVP of global engineering, Krystian Kolondra, asserted the companydoes not hate ads but rather wantsthe industry to adaptto meet consumers expectations, pointing to how browsers helped curtail annoying pop-ups ads in the past as an example of how ad makers have adapted to browser-enforced changes before.And bringing up the concept of ad whitelists by noting that Opera provides a tool where users can test how heavy a webpages ads are in order to make an informed choice about whether or not they want to block ads or add a page to their own whitelist.Kolondra thensays Opera considered building its own whitelist of acceptable ads  to borrow the phrasingused by desktop ad-block company Adblock Plus (whose business model involvesad giantspaying it to have their ads whitelisted, provided those ads also conform to its set of guidelines about contextual relevance, low intrusivenessand so on).He writes:We think browser-level or server-side native ad blocking is faster and better than extensions or other third-party tools. Opera currently only features a very small whitelist of websites, but were aware we need to provide a better solution for the future. The big question is: which ads are good, which are bad for the users, and who is responsible for making it better?However at this point it looks likeOperais not going to seek to replicatea whitelist-style ad business model of its own. Rather Kolondra saysit intends to work with anad industry standardization effort to drive change  albeit, with an implicit threat that if thisinitiative doesnt live up to consumer expectations, Opera may have to have a rethink.We first considered implementing our own solution, but after discussing with industry bodies like Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), we think we can influence the ad industry to change by working together with them on their existing standardization efforts, writes Kolondra, adding that Opera is nowtalking with IAB to see how a browser can implement support for their LEAN initiative, once this is ready, if it truly manages to serve the end user needs for speed.(Emphasis his.)The Lean initiative  which stands for Light, Encrypted, Ad choice supported, Non-invasive ads  was launched by the IAB in October last year, in direct response to the rise in popularity of ad-blocking technologies. Although it is not aimed at overhauling ad standards entirely. But rather anattemptto create an alternative set of standards to, in the words of the IAB, provide choice for marketers, content providers, and consumers.Whether the ad industry has the ability to reform its practices wholesale seems doubtful. But the prospect of a sub-set of so-called Lean ads being whitelisted by browsers like Opera in future  thereby providing an incentive for more ad companies to adhere to these alternative standards  seems to be the thinkinghere.Its not entirely clear what Lean ads means in practice at this point, either, although the IAB specifically references two of the many necessary areas of concentration, as it puts it, as:So, for Opera, as a company with its own ad subsidiary and potentially also soon the subsidiary of a bunch of ad companies, acompromise strategy on ad-blocking that involveswhitelisting a subset of better ads appears to be a little more coherent than an out-and-out anti-ad stance.Albeit, as TCs Frederic Lardinois has previously noted, the companyhas been going through a period of uncertainty in recent times  withCEO Lars Boilesentelling TechCrunch earlier this year that the in-trainacquisition wasnt really his decisionandthat the company would be just fine if the deal never closed. Onesuggestion thereforebeing that Operas ad-blocking push might in fact be an attempt toprovoke its potential acquirers and perhapssabotage thedeal.
