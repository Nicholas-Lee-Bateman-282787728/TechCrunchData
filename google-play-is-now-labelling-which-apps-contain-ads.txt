Google has justmade a change to its mobile application storefront, Google Play, which will help customers make better decisions about the apps they want to download: its now displaying if an app contains advertisements. This label will now appear alongside the existing designation which indicates if an app offers in-app purchases, the company has confirmed to TechCrunch.The change could impact existing developers who monetize with ads, as it will help customers avoid apps that use ad-supported business models.The new label was first spotted by the blog Android Police, citing a Reddit posting.In-app advertisements can help developers generate revenue, but theyre often seen by consumers as an annoyance  or even a spammy way to make money from an app. Ads can mar the experience of using an app as their banners flash and cause accidental clicks, or they pop up in the middle of usage andinterrupt gameplay, for example.For these reasons and more, many consumers actively avoid apps with ads when they can.However, it hasnt been easy to figure out which apps are ad-supported until now.Google hasworking towards this change sincelast year. It first began to label ad-supported apps and those with in-app purchases as a part ofits Designated for Families program. Apps willing to undergo an additional review wereadded to a special family section of the Google Play store last May.Then, later in 2015 Google began asking all Android developers to go to their Google Play Developer Console and submit a response as towhether their apps contain ads or not, ahead of Googlesplan to label ad-supported apps outside of itsfamily section.The company said its goal with the effort has been to provide more transparency, and help consumers make more informed decisions.The change also comes at a time when Google has been working topromotethe higher quality apps on its app store. Itassigned content ratings and family star badges to kidsapps and games last year, beganvetting apps through a manual review process, and, more recently, it launchedits first-everapp awards to call out some of Google Plays topthird-party developers and their creations.Its interesting also to compare this change with similartransparency efforts from rival Apple. In April 2014, Apple began to better highlightwhich apps and games included in-app purchases in the iOS App Store and iTunes. This practice continues today.However, while some of those in-app purchases will allow iOS usersto remove the ads from anapp (e.g., see The Weather Channel example below), the App Store doesnt specifically indicate via a label that the app in question is ad-supported.Google, meanwhile, has offered a similar label on its apps to help consumers make decisions about which they wanted to buy.However, in both cases, this app labeling was largelyfocused on helping parents avoid buying apps for kids that used this sort of business model,following settlements with the FTC over unauthorized in-app purchases that cost the companies millions.Calling out apps with ads, however, is more about letting consumers pick higher-quality apps easily, and less about thwarting regulators.Google confirms that the change was introduceda few days ago and is rolling out globally over the next two weeks. It will impact all app categories.(Image credits: Imgur via Reddit usercgutman; Apple iTunes)
