In what could be one of the most interesting and important uses of 3D scanning to come along in a long while, the Initial Training Network for Digital Cultural Heritage is working to collect photographs of the destroyed statues that can be used to piece together 3D models of the destroyed artifacts. With enough visual data, the group should be able to recreate the objects to scale and undo, in some way, the damage wrought by ISIS at the Mosul Museum.The plea is simple: We are looking for volunteers to help virtually restore the Mosul Museum, write the volunteers. This includes finding photos, processing data, contributing to the website and generally helping out with organising the effort to identify the museum artefacts. You can email them here.The project is being organized by Matthew Vincent, Marinos Ioannides, and Chance M. Coughenour and is looking for folks to help with 3D modeling and even website maintenance. They write:This use of 3D printing, scanning, and digital archeology is actually quite stirring: it can resurrect history that has been destroyed by ignorance in ways unheard of even a few years ago. Ive reached out to the team and hopefully they can share some of the work over the next few months  like this recreation of the Lion of Mosul, nearly ready for its 3D printed debut.The Lion of Mosul
