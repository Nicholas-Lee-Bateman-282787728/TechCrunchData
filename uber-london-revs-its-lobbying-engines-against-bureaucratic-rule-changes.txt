Transport for London, the local body responsible for transport regulations in the U.K. capital, has published a set of proposals for changes to regulations pertaining to the operation of private hire vehicles (PHVs) in the city  with the stated aim of improving passenger safety.Anyrule changes would of course affect the operation of Ubers on-demand business in London, so the company has mobilized its U.K. users, urging them to sign a petition againstthe proposed new rules which it dubsbureaucratic, arguing they would signal the end of the Uber you know and love.TfLs new PHV consultation runs till late December, with any new rules set to be implementedearly next year  based on the feedback it receives on theproposals. Its the second consultation TfL has kicked off this year. The earlier March consultation garnered some 4,000 responses, and hasbeen used to shape the proposals in the latest consultation, according toa TfL spokesman.The regulations on PHV in London date back to 1998. The spokesman noted there has been a big increase in PHVs in the city in recent years  which is why its consulting on changes now.Recent stats from the U.K. governments Department for Transportrecorded a25.9 percent hikein PHVs operating in London between 2013 and 2015. Over the same period London taxi numbers increased by just 1.5 percent.Writing in the consultation documents, TfL states:After careful consideration of the responses to our initial consultation, we are bringing forward a package of proposals for further consultation that we consider will strengthen the regulation of private hire services in London. Our overriding concern in developing these proposals is to improve passenger safety. We are also committed to maintaining a clear distinction between the taxi and private hire trades and further improving the quality, safety, accessibility and overall standard of private hire vehicle provision in London. We believe that the proposed measures will contribute to this aim and invite comments and views before making any changes.Theproposals run to some25 points  and include severalchangesthat would havean obvious impact onUbers operations. Uber is of course able to participate in the consultation, by submitting its feedback to TfL, along with all the other PHV firms in London.Among proposals TfLis consideringare that:Uber does not offer a pre-booking facility so thats one proposed change that would cause an obvious operational headache for the business.The Uber app also displays bookable carsin the users vicinity in real-time  which is pretty much the killer feature of the app, from a UX point of view, so being forced to ditch that would likely make Uber a whole lot less sticky. Add to that, the proposed requirement to have a five-minute pre-pick-up wait time would also erode Ubersconvenience  near real-time pick-ups from a customers location are a keyreason the apphas been able to poach customers from existing PHV businesses, and steal a march on traditional taxi businesses.Responding to the TfL consultation, Uber provided the following statement to TechCrunch  attributed toJo Bertram, its Regional General Manager, UK, Ireland and Nordics  in which it claims the changes are aimed at protecting Londons black cabs, rather than improving passenger safety:These bureaucratic new rules will not improve your ride. Theyre designed to address the concerns of black cab drivers, who feel under pressure from increased competition. But the answer is to reduce the onerous regulations cabbies face today  not increase them for everyone else.Ubernow has more than 1 million users in the U.K., along with 18,000 drivers in London alone.The company has used that platform to mobilize a lobbying effort to fight the proposed changes, messaging U.K. users to ask them to sign a petition  and following similar lobbying tactics to those it deployed in New York recently to steer off regulatory changesthere.At the time of writing,Ubers petitionhas gained just under 80,000 signatures (or around 8percent of its U.K. user base)  with the company touting that its getting a signature per minute.In the consultation document, TfL adds that it already intends to take forward certain other measures  including a requirement for disability awareness training, noting that groups representing disabled passengers have told of many issues with availability and more general attitude to those with disabilities.TfLwrites:We will include a requirement that introduces training for private hire drivers, to include disability awareness. This will be developed from autumn 2015 and all new licence applicants will be expected to undertake the training prior to becoming licensed. Renewal applicants will also be required to undertake this training ahead of the renewal of their licence.Update:Uber is not the only taxi app complaining about TfLs proposed rule changes. London based Kabbee, a minicab booking and price comparison app, said in its view mostof the new rules are ultimately designed to benefit black taxi drivers, over the 78K+ private hire drivers in London.In a statement, CEO and founder Justin Peters said: We strongly urge TfL to consider making a set of requirements that are applicable and fair to both parties, as each one plays an essential role in providing a safe and reliable transport service for Londoners.We disagree with a five minute delay for bookings, as GPS technology enables operators to provide a better customer experience and reduce waiting times.Reduced waiting times benefit drivers and Londoners alike so TfL should be careful putting forward legislation that means everyone waits longer, he added.
