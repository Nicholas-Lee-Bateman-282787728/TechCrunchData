Yahoo Kids died a quiet death two years ago, but to BJ Heinley (who worked on the product from 1996 to 2000) the shutdown was a travesty, depriving kids and parents of a valuable place to find fun, safe content.Hes aiming to fill that hole with a new search engine called Thinga.Heinleys been building Thinga for the past year under the umbrella of The Bear James Company, his startup for child and family-oriented projects. Its not the first kid-focused search engine out there (others include GoGooligans and KidRex), but the idea is to create a site that appeals to contemporary kids.Heinley described Thinga as a walled garden. Like any search engine, kids can type in the terms that theyre interested in, but all the Thinga results come from the companyscontent library, without ads, either hand-selected by Heinleysteam or pulled from whitelisted, kid-friendly sites. Its not a complete walled garden though  the internal results are followed by search resultsfrom DuckDuckGo.(Update:Some usersspotted some inappropriate results sneaking in this way, but Heinley said that was because a database of blacklisted words hadnt been properly syncd. The issue should be resolved now.)Or userscan just browse the latest Thinga content without searching at all  the homepage offers selections divided into areaslike Video, Cool and Animals. And its all COPPA-compliant.As for making money, Thinga is focused on a freemium model  the site is free, but Heinley will be launching a related, subscription kids magazine called Boom. The sites also selling T-shirts, postersand more through the Thinga store.And eventhough there are concerns around advertising to kids, that doesnt mean outside brands will be shut out entirely. Heinley said hes exploring options like a private ad network, and Thinga has already collaborated with the Cirque du Soleil show Kooza on a promotion combining a kid reporter interview and ticket giveaway. (Kid reporters are the best.)
