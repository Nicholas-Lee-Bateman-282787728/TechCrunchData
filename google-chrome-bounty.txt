After shelling out $2 million in rewards to security bounty hunters in 2015, Google announced today it is doubling the reward for reporting serioussecurity flaws, raising the top bounty from $50,000 to $100,000.Google has been pretty serious about its security on Chrome; it has had a bug-hunting bounty in place since 2010, eligible to hackers who find vulnerabilities on Chromebooks, the Chrome browser and Chrome OS.Google distributed more than $2 million in security rewards to hackers last year.The increase in the top-level reward program is aimed at persistent compromise of a Chromebook in guest mode. In other words: A Chromebook that is hacked in guest mode, and remains hacked after a reboot.Google never had an opportunity to pay out the bounty when it stood at $50,000, but the wording of the target hints at why Google is making this type of exploit a priority: The company wants to get ahead of zero-day exploits. By increasing the bounty to $100,000 for the most egregious exploits, the company no doubt hopes itwill be able to lure hackers itsway so the Chrome teamcan resolve the issues, rather than letting more sinister forces buy access to the vulnerabilities.
