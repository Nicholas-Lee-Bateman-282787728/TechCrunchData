MobileIron is introducing a new Content Security Service (CSS) today that providesIT with a cloud security umbrella to set document protections across a variety of services, even when employees save documentsto a personal account.In todays BYOD (bring-your-own-device) world, IT knows all too well that people savecompany content topersonal cloud storage accounts, even if there are rules prohibiting it.Depending on the service, the companycould lose control of the content when it leaves their sphere of influence.Somecloud storage services such as Syncplicity and Box provide document-level protection that lets you expire documents or decide who can edit, copy or share.MobileIron VPof Strategy Ojas Rege says, while these services work fine, and both companies are actually partners, these controlsonly work within their given services.What MobileIron brings is a level of control at the document level where IT administrators can set whatever document security they wish, regardless of the service, thereby separating security controls from the storage service.IT sets security levelsin a control panel and decides which services to include. Out of the box (so to speak), it will support Dropbox and Box.The security works on a number of levels. First of all, it offers encryption and key management. Next, it providesbasic data loss prevention(DLP) with remote wiping, document expiration, controls for saving and sharing and so forth. It also offers an audit trail for compliance purposes. Finally, it lets you share encrypted files in-house with teams and other employees.Rege says customers will be ableto share MobileIron encrypted files outside the companyin a future update.For todays release, Rege explained the mobile front end for these tools is MobileIronsown Docs at Work mobile app, but over the coming months they plan to offer support for a number of options.While it doesnt offer everything today, Rege explained the companyalways planned aphasedapproach. In the first phase, they developed Docs at Work. In this phase, they introduce the content securityand in the last phase coming at a later date, they will provide access to a broader set of tools through an application programming interface (API).He says the idea is not to restrict end users, but to give them as many options as possible. In the next release, IT shouldbe able tolink to any services that have an API and provide that encryption and security across services, even ones that arent necessarily officially sanctioned in-house.The content security product also links with MobileIron device security solutionswhich offer services like remote wipe if a device is lost or stolen. The company sees the document security as logical extension of the device securityOverall, this product is meant to provide some level of confidence for customers that as theymove deeper into a BYOD world where employees are using their own mobile devices, and transferring content to their own services outside of ITs purview, IT can still maintain control of companycontent.Given that the device doubles as a personal and work tool, it makes sense to try to protect the documents. While MobileIron would surely argue you should be protecting the device too, protecting the content is what truly matters here, and if you can expire documents on the fly or provide meaningful encryption, thats a big step.For now, with this phases constraints, its not a security panacea by any means, but at least its a start for organizations looking for some semblance of control over content without having to restrictthe services their employees are using.
