Dear readers,Im writing to inform you that the TC Meetup + Pitch-off in NYC is in less than a week, and tickets are selling out fast. I dont want you to miss out. You dont want you to miss out. So lets not tarry. The TC Meetup + Pitch-off is a very special event, hosted by yours truly, that gives 10 new startups from the New York ecosystem an opportunity to pitch their product in sixty seconds or less to a panel of kick-ass judges. Those judges include Greycrofts Alan Patricof, Foursquares J Crowley, FirstMarks Amish Jani, Quires Erin Glenn, and TC East Coast Editor John Biggs. After each pitch, judges will conduct a quick Q&A session and after all the pitches have concluded, will deliberate to determine a winner. First place gets a table in the Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in September. Second place will receive two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner will receive one ticket to the big show. Companies selected to participate will be announced very shortly. In the meantime, if you just want to hang out with cool people, throw back a few drinks (21+ only, please) and watch some entrepreneurs turn what is usually a 30-minute presentation into a sixty-second elevator pitch, buy tickets. The whole thing is going down on August 18 at Le Poisson Rouge, with doors opening at 6pm. You can purchase tickets to the event right here.Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
