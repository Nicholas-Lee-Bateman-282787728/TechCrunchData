Andrew Keen is the author of three books: Cult of the Amateur, Digital Vertigo and The Internet Is Not The Answer. He produces Futurecast, and is the host of Keen On. The Canadian tech futurist and writer Don Tapscott has always had a nose for the next big thing. His best-selling book, Wikinomics, for example, introduced many people to the radical idea of a wiki.And now Don and his son Alex are back with another big book and big idea. Their Blockchain Revolution introduces blockchain as the new Internet  a technology that will once again change everything.The Tapscotts argue that the fundamentally transparent nature of blockchain technology  with its unalterable public ledger  will force politicians to be more honest about themselves and their intentions. Blockchain, they promise, will eventually disinfect the American political system  exposing dishonesty and triggering a more accountable political conversation.So what about the 2016 election? Here, the Tapscotts are less optimistic. By 2020 or 2024, they suggest, things will have changed. But the Blockchain revolution, they regret, will play a minimal role in this years election.As always, many thanks to the folks at CALinnovatesfor their help in the production of this interview.
