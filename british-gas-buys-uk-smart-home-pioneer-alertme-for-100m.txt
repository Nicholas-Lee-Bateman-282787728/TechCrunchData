The connected home may still be a distant miragefor mostaverage consumers, but in the meantime the technology is becoming big business. Today, British Gas announced it will buyAlertMe, a developer of platforms for running various domestic smart devices, in a deal worth 65 million ($100 million), lining up the energy company to provide smart services coveringheating, lighting and more. The net cost to British Gas and its owner Centrica will be44 million ($68 million), after accounting for anexisting 21% investment in the company.In addition to being an investor, British Gas wasa user of its services, specifically in its Hive product, which lets you control your heating and hot water remotely. Hive is in use by 150,000 customers today.Smart home technology may sound like a novelty to some, but it is more than that. Itis a way of improving the efficiency and cost associated withenergy use, andin many cases it can make everyday lifesimpler andeasier for people.Founded in 2006, Cambridge, UK-based AlertMewas an early mover in connected home technology  the idea of giving dumb services like your heating a network connection that helps calibrate and control them in a more efficient way. (And heres an interesting fact: AlertMewas a partner of Googles in one of the search giantsearliest attempts to tackle the smart home, the now-defunct Powermeter.)AlertMe provides an end-to-end service in the form of a platform that lets differentdevices and applications communicate with each other and provide a complete picture to customers of theirenergy use. The company had raised a total of $36.8 million from backers that also included Index Ventures,VantagePoint Capital Partners,SET Venture PartnersandGood Energies.AlertMe has been the pioneer in establishing and growing the Internet of Things commercially in the UK and USA, saidMary Turner, CEO of AlertMe, in a statement. We have created a market-leading Internet of Things platform and a highly experienced team of technologists and operational capability, which together have given us proven ability to serve mass market customers.We are excited to move forward with British Gas, with an opportunity to roll out service for tens of millions of homes, and to realise our ambition for further global distribution.But even as an early mover, AlertMe didnt really have much in the way of critical mass. The company says its technology was in use in200,000 homes, with personalized energy data servicesin500,000 homes, with many of those in the form of smart meters. (In terms of data points the numbers are much higher: there are1 billion smart reader readings taken each month and 10 billioninternet of things data pointsoverall.)With its new asset, British Gas, which is owned by energy conglomerate Centrica, will potentially be turbo charging AlertMes business, including rolling out new smart home products that control other aspects of the homebeyond just heating.In an email to existing Hive customers, British Gas says the acquisition of AlertMe means the company now has all the technical parts in place to launch a family of smart home products. This move means well bring you truly magical products which can help you to reimagine the way you live in your home much more quickly, it adds.Interestingly, the smart hub that comes as part of a Hive installation uses the Zigbee smart home wireless standard. Its firmware is upgradable to enable it to become smarter and support additional devices.In this context  and with the acquisition of AlertMe  the Hive thermostat can be seen as a Trojan horse into the smart home, and sets up British Gas to become a much broader player in the burgeoning smart home space.Our understanding is that, in addition to other heating-related products (such as multi-room zones and radiator control valves), the utility company is eyeing up smart lighting as an additional Hive product or at least something that could be controlled and supported by the core Hive offering, perhaps via support for an existing third-party smart lightbulb product.We are very excited at the potential weve now got through technology, to help people manage their homes and lives more easily, saidNina Bhatia, commercial director for British Gas, in a statement. With access to new technology and skills were strengthening our capability at British Gas to develop a family of products that will put people in control of their homes in a way thats simply never been possible before.The utility company currently has 11 million customers  and potentially more in its geographic footprint. With the acquisition, British Gas saysthat it will become the UKs largest connected homes provider  although tobe honest that isnt really saying much. The market is nascent, to say the least, which is part of the reason why its significant that British Gas is making an early move.Not too early, though, when you consider what its competition is doing. A number of other utility companies in the UK have recently signed partnerships with smart thermostat companies/startups, in a backdrop of new energy efficiency targets set by the UK regulator Ofgem. Google-owned Nest is being offered to Npowers customers, Berlin-based startup Tado has teamed up with SSE, and French startup Netatmo has recently partnered with EDF Energy.Meanwhile, todays acquisition of AlertMe by British Gas comes at a time when we are seeing some significant interest and investment into connected come technologies, both in the form of infrastructureand also hardware.That includes Sigfox just earlier this week raising $115million to build out its Internet-of-Things-exclusive cellular data network; Apples efforts forits HomeKit SDK, and companies like Google paying billions to acquire companies like Nest and Dropcam to make sure it also has a place at the connected home table.
