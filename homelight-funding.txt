HomeLight, a startup to help thosetrying to buy or sell their homes find the right real estate agent, has raised $3 million in new funding.The startup, whichlaunched in November 2012,analyzes home sales data to determine an agents strengths and weaknesses. It then uses that information to deliver recommendations when you search based on things like city, neighborhood, property type and price range.Co-founder and CEO Drew Uher has said that he created the service after he and his wife tried to find a real estate agent when buying their first home. It was a painful process, because there was no good place to research agents.The service covers 38 U.S. markets, with records for over 2 million agents. Uher told me via email that more than $160 million in real estate deals have been set up through the platform.The new funding was led by Bullpen Ventures, with participation from Montage Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Krillion Ventures, 500 Startups and Western Technology Investment. (Google Ventures also participated in the companys previous funding.) HomeLight has now raised a total of $4.85 million, and among other things, its going spend that money on a big marketing push.Before the end of 2015, we would love for HomeLight to start to become a household name  the first thing consumers think of when starting the buying or selling process, Uher said.
