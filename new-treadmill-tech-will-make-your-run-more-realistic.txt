A new technology from researchers at Ohio State allows runners to feel as if they are speeding up or slowing down naturally. The treadmill-based tech takes sonar readings of the users position on the belt and can tell when to crank things up or slow things down.Created by Steven T. Devor, associate professor of kinesiology, and former graduate student Cory Scheadler, the system simulates outside running.If youre running outside and you want to speed up or slow down, there is no button to push. It is the same with this new automated treadmill, said Devor.The system uses off-the-shelf components and the team has patented the method. They expect to commercialize it soon.From the release:So many people call it the dreadmill. It is boring and monotonous. An automated treadmill makes the experience much more natural and you can just run without thinking of what pace you want to set, said Devor.
