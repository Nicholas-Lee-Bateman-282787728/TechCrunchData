We hope you accomplishedenough this week. If not, you wont be saving your productivity this Friday afternoon, so were here to CrunchWeek with you.This time around Sarah Buhr, Colleen Taylorand Alex Wilhelm riff through the latest Yahoo and Foursquare rumors, Etsys mind-bending initial public offering, and Slacks massive new capital raise.Some numbers for context: If Yahoo does pick up Foursquare for $900 million, that will be a steep $1.9 billionless than the dollar sum at which Slack recently raised. Foursquare, of course, is a bit older than the new productivity service. Scale matters.Hit play, and then find something chilled and a roof to sit on. Its a lovely day after all.
