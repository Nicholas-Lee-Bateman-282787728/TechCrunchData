Sony announced its latest corporate reshuffle whichwill see itfocus onits PlayStation and its entertainmentbusinesses, as well as itsCMOS image sensor unit,as it bids to return to healthy profit levels by 2018.The company hasreported six net loses over the last seven years, but it said that this new three-year strategy is aimed at delivering a500 billion yen ($4.2 billion) consolidated operating profit for its fiscal 2017. Sony recorded a $1.2 billion loss for its lastfull year of business (fiscal 2013) last March, and it is expected to post another loss  albeit a slimmer one  for FY2014.PlayStation and entertainment (Sony Pictures and Sony Music) aside, itsother business interests will be managed intwo ways  as units that can provide stable profit levels, orhigher risk business where Sony will focus onvolatility management. ItsImaging Products & Solutions and Video & Sound business, for example, falls into the former category  because Sony doesnt see the general market for these products changing massively. Meanwhile, its mobile phone and TV businesses are in the latter basket because both markets are experiencing intense cost competition and commoditization.The new focus will see Sonys video and sound business spun into its own organization  as itdid with its TV business last year. The Japanese firm said that it will also move forward with preparations for splitting out other business units, although it hasnt specifiedwhich ones at this point.Sony is giving these units more freedom and autonomy in order to give each one a clearer focus on its business and profits, and the ability to make faster decisions. Those ingredients will help bring the best out of the more struggling areas of the company,Sony said.Reuters early reported that analysts are tipping the Japanese giant to eventually pull out of its loss-makingmobile business altogether. Thats not entirely clear from todays announcement, although theas-yet-unnamed businesses that will be spun out could include mobile and those units couldfollow the pathas Sonys Vaio PC business, which was sold last year as part of a reorganization.
