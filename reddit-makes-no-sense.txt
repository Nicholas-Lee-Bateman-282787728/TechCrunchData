Why does reddit exist? How does reddit exist? Who are all of these people who participate? Who knows? Theyre anonymous. How does something like reddit attract $50 million in funding? I have no idea, and a lot of the people Ive been speaking to in tech circles over the past week dont know, either.Its justyou knowreddit. It makes no sense.A VC I spoke with yesterday told me that if a reddit clone with even pretty decent trjaction was brought to her as a potential investment, she would close down the meeting before it even got started. But yet, theres reddit, raising $50 million at a $500 million valuation.Just to get you up to speed with the latest drama from reddit land (remember, this is a fully funded company, not just a community of anonymous people who like to chat): CEO quits
 Interim CEO brought in
 Everythings great!
 Interim CEO changes things to make the site safer
 Community freaks out
 Company fires popular employee
 Community freaks out
 Interim CEO quits
 Everythings great!
 New CEO, who was the first CEO, re-hired and introduced by board member
 Everythings great!
 Chief engineer quits after two months, says Interim CEO was set up to fail
 ?????And that was just the past, like, few months (mostly in the past week).First off, how does an interim CEO quit? Arent they just in place until the new CEO is selected? In this case, Steve Huffman was brought in as reddits permanent CEO. Why not wait a few days and communicate that the interim is no longer needed and the permanent has been brought in?Weird.Second, why is Sam Altman, member of the board and lead investor, bringing team news to the community. They dont know him, probably shouldnt know him and probably dont care to know him. The players that are important for the community to interface with are the founders and executive team. Bringing in yet another character giving lip service to the core (trust me, its not as big as you think it is) community.Odd.Reddit mostly exists, or still exists, because it competed with a site called Digg that completely imploded. How bad was that implosion? Recently, Diggs former CEO Jay Adelson told Fast Company:Ultimately, there was a feeling that users had lost their influence over the site. It just couldnt surviveand I think it took one weekend for most of the user base to leave Digg and go to Reddit.Can you imagine watching your core community  the most passionate people on your site, the one that created so much interest that you almost sold yourself to Google  disappear? Goodbye. Outta here. Cya never?Reddit flirts with that type of revolt every week, it seems, but there doesnt seem to be a candidate to suck up its core angry mob. Voat is one that people mention, but that site goes down anytime a thread goes over a thousand comments.Its obvious that there are two main layers to any site like reddit or Digg: core community members and the rest of the users. A core community member tells you that they want this bell or whistle in your app, while another user uses whatever you give them. Both can be loyal, but users are generally more passive aboutcore issues around a site.For example, reddits recent Oprah act (Youre the CEO, Youre the CEO, Youre CEO!) didnt even affect the direction of the site.Traffic? Fine.Content on front page? Normal for reddit standards.All is well in bizarro reddit land. Except its lead engineer quit today after just two months on the job. But thats cool, right? Totally normal.Its business model isnt rocket science. The company sells ads that look like components of the site to companies who arent aware where their content actually sits. If you were, say, Hulu, would you pay actual dollars to be a few clicks away from a forum where people are talking about how to get away with raping a woman? Probably not.Its former CEO joked around about whats been happening at reddit, and its so far-fetched that its probably true.I know, its all as weird as reddit is. Doesnt make sense. Probably never will.
