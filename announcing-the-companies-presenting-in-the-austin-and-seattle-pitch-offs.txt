Next week, the TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off is coming to Austin and Seattle, and we have some amazing companies prepping to hop on stage and show their stuff.If you dont know about the Pitch-Offs, heres a quick run-down:Around ten startups from the area will have exactly sixty seconds to present their products on stage to a live audience and a panel of expert VC judges and TC editorial staff. The judges will run a quick Q&A after each pitch, and at the end of presentations, deliberate backstage to determine a winner.First place gets a Startup Alley table at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco. Second place gets two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner takes home one ticket to the big show.If youd like to join us for the events, you can buy tickets below:Buy tickets for the Austin Meetup on June 23.
