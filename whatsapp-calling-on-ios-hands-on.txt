WhatsApps new voice calling feature for iOS is decent quality and easy to use, but the experience doesntbeat dedicated VoIP apps for clarity. At this point, at least.Thats our early take on the free calls feature that the Facebook-owned service began introducingto its iOS app this week. Already live to all users on Android, free calls are slowly rolling out to Apple device owners  but TechCrunch managed to sneak in early and road-test the feature today.WhatsApps new feature has the potential to cause serious headaches for operators in markets where the messaging app is popular, such India and chunks of the Middle East, Europe and Latin America. (The service may have 800 million monthly users, but that doesnt mean global domination, as I explained earlier this week.) WhatsApp is one of a number of messaging apps toravage telcos SMS revenues after collecting hundreds of millions of downloads worldwide. Indeed, the number ofmessages sent on WhatsApp alone each day is 50 per higher than global SMS volumes.Despite all that potential, we  and the people we spoke to  found the quality of calls to be fine, but not on the same level asdedicated calling apps like Viber. Personally I found it to load faster than Skype, which is a real bonus. However, thecallsfelt like free international phone calls, which is exactly what they were. Thats unlikely to bother most people though.WhatsApp is slowly rolling the feature out  as it stresstests the additional load that its hundreds millions of userswill add to its network  so callclarity and qualitymay yet improveover time.The actual process of calling viaWhatsApp is easy.Theres a prominent icon at the top of your ongoing chats, while you can hunt that person down in your contact list, where youll find a call icon next to the chat button.As with other VoIP calling services, making a call takes over your phone screen with a WhatsApp call label in the top left corner.Receiving a call is just like a normal call too it even uses your phones default ringtone.Interestingly, calls from people who are not amongyour contactsshow up as unknown with no number displayed. Thats good from a privacy perspective for people making calls, but less than ideal for those who receive them.Free calling and texts have become commoditized by the large number of chat apps that offer them, but WhatsApp is still lacking in one obvious area: user IDs.Giving out your phone number is the only way to connect, and that is a riskybusiness. In the event that the person becomes a nuisance, merely blocking them on WhatsApp doesnt stop them from being able to reach you.Dedicated IDs would give WhatsApp users more control over their privacy. Now that calls are coming to iOS, Id expect to see this feature arrivesoon. That wouldbringWhatsApp on par with other messaging apps that have long offered user IDs, such as Telegram, Line, Kik and Kakao Talk.If youre an avid WhatsApp user who is desperate to get this feature, youll need to find a person who already has calls enabled and get them to phoneyou. Once your call with them is finished, simply restart WhatsApp and  hey presto  you should now have the feature.Thanks@abd_khfor hooking me up with calls!
