Y Combinator-backed Spoil is looking to take the pain out of gift-giving with the launch of its personalized gift concierge service.Its a pitch that either sounds amazing (if youre lazy) or kind of sad: give Spoil a description of a friend, acquaintance, or relatives interests and personality, and theyll send them a gift picked out by a dedicated shopper who knows a specific category of products very well.As a gift-giver, you dont know what your recipient will get until they do. All you know is which gift tier you paid for on the site, with prices currently ranging from $35 for the entry-level package to $500 for the Black tier. The feecovers the cost of the gift, curation, tax, and shipping, with higher prices mostly going to higher-end presents.Spoil co-founder Cristian Asenjo compares using the service to getting someone a gift card. You know how much youre putting on the card, and you know roughly where theyd like to spend that much money, but youre not picking out the exact gift theyll receive.If you head over to Spoils site, their entire home page is the interface for sending a gift. You give the high-level reason for sending a gift (I love you or Thank you, for example), the recipients gender, their interests, and where the gift will go. Its all one screen, with very little manual text entry  perfect for the eventual jump to mobile.So far, the team has processed 500 gift deliveries since launching four months ago with fewer than 10 returns. The team currently has just six curators processing orders, though theyre currently doing trials with several more so that they can find better gifts in more categories.Co-founderCharles-Eric Gascon says the team expects Valentines Day to be huge for Spoil, with approximately 70 percent of gifts already processed having been between couples. The most popular gift tiers in the United States (Spoil can ship to the US and Canada) are the $50-$100 brackets, though Spoil would like to move up-market with even higher-end packages as they gain traction.
