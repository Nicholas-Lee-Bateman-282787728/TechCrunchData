Were one short month away from TCs first regional Pitch-offs of the year, and I couldnt be more excited to be hitting up a coupleof my favorite cities, Boston and Atlanta.On February 23 and February 25, TechCrunch will be visiting Boston and Atlanta, respectively, to host our world-renowned Meetup + Pitch-off.Over the course of the evening,10companies will duke it out onstage with 60-second presentations. A judges panel, comprising local VCs and TechCrunch editors, will hold a quick Q&A after every pitch and eventually determine a winner.First place gets a table in Startup Alley at TC Disrupt NY in May. Second place gets two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner walks away with one ticket to the big show.Think youve got what it takes?Apply here to participate in the Pitch-Off. Applications close February 11.But the night is about so much more than a friendly startup competition. Folks will be able to network with their local tech community and have the chance to pitch their own startups and products to TC editors and writers.Tickets cost $20 and, since they include alcohol, we ask that you please be 21 and older.You can buy tickets for Boston here and tickets for Atlanta here.Cant wait to see you!Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
