The company posted 35 cents per share during holiday season, well above analyst estimates of 25 cents per share, and the 21 cents per share reported in the same period last year. Fitbit also brought in $712 million in revenue, which surpassed analyst estimates of $648 million, and nearly doubled the $370 million in sales seen in fourth quarter 2014.While the company has managed to excel in the fitness tech category, growing competition from smartwatches meant that some early adopters are making the switchfrom Fitbit to Apple Watch.Fitbit shares are down 44% since the beginning of the year because investors did not like Fitbits new smartwatch that was announced at CES.Others in the space include Misfit, which was recently acquired by Fossil, and Jawbone, which has struggled to retain significant market share. Jawbone has filed several lawsuits against Fitbit, including patent infringement.Fitbit went public on the New York Stock Exchange last June, pricing its shares at $20. The stock closed Monday at $16.48 and the company has a market cap of $3.4 billion.
