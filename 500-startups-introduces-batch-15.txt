It seems like only yesterday that we were introducing you to 500s Batch 14, but Summer is gone, the demos have been done, weve picked our favs and its time to introduce you to the next group going through 500s accelerator  500 Startups Batch 15.500 Startups has a thesis of investing in many startups, some that they consider unsexy, because they make money (most of the companies in this batch are already doing anywhere between $10k-$100k in revenue) *gasp*, and some that they know might not survive in the real worldbut its worth giving it a shot.This batch has everything.Theres on-demand snow plowing, a platform for students to find off-campus housing, a DIY Minecraft computer, sub-sea drones, toys and treats for your puppy, window treatments, freestyle raps, a Google for nature (huh?) and an easier way to manage all of your fines and parking tickets.Most of the companies are at a later-stage seed situation.Its also a diverse group: 43 percent of the companies in this batch are international (Canada, India, Hong Kong, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil, Vietnam, Japan, Denmark, Italy, Chile) and 33 percent have at least one female founder.While theres never really a formal theme going on over at 500 Startups, the team is looking at developer tools and platforms and unusual markets like crocheting and postpartum care to fill out its portfolio.Heres 500 Startups Batch 15 (and if your company is interested in applying for the next batch, applications are open):The A-Z doesnt end here. See something you dig and want to learn how to invest? Well, 500 is glad you asked. Theyre teaching a course on it. Its two weeks long and starts next February.
