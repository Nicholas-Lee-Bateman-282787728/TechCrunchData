Uber has introduced its carpooling program, Uber Pool, in India inits latest move to grow its presence inthe worlds second mostpopulous country.The service is initially being piloted inBengaluru, which becomes the sixth city worldwide for the Uber Pool service but the first in India. The move is indicative of Ubers aspirations for its role in the India, a market whereit claims to be experiencing 40 percent month-on-month growth.It looks like the company just beat rival Ola, the SoftBank-backed domestic ride-sharing firm which is currently raising $500 million, to the punch. TechCrunch understands from sources that Olas own carpooling service  Ola Pool update: the service will be called OlaShare  will launch next week. While Uber Pool is starting out in one city, Ola Pool will be in an initial five cities, allowing customers there to split fares and share cabs.Although its clear Uber hopes the introduction of the service in India will significantly increase its rider capacity, a spokesperson also said that Uber believesadoption of carpooling services in the countrycould dramatically reduce traffic congestion. The carpooling service allows commuters with collinear start and end points to share a vehicle, thus reducing the cost of their ride.With UberPoolwell aim to achieve this vision, one we share with policy makers, to make Bangalore a city of the future  one that looks a whole lot greener, cleaner, and more efficient thanks to fewer cars and more shared rides, Uber Bengalurusgeneral manager Bhavik Rathod said ina statement.Informal carpooling services are widespread in India at prices incredibly low by Ubers normal standards. Undercutting the rock-bottom prices that consumers already encounter for carpools in India may be the biggest challenge Uber will face with the introduction of UberPool.The induction of the service into Bengaluru was facilitated in part by a recent carpooling initiative by the citys Traffic Police, explained an Uber spokesperson. The campaign is centered on publicity initiatives to reduce vehicle numbers in congested areas.We desire to see around 40,000 vehicles of these off the streets on a daily basis through the carpooling initiative, said MA Saleem, Additional Commissioner of Police for Traffic, told the Bangalore Mirror earlier this month.Although the company has not yet released price estimates for rides in Bengaluru, it claims that Uber Pool commuters can reduce ride costs by up to 50 percent. Whether or not even this price cut can face up to the massive informal carpooling market in India is unclear, and with a similar service from Ola on the horizon, Ubers advantage is perhaps minimal. Its also worth noting that domestic competitor Meru Cabs already launched a similar feature at the beginning of the month, in a move that increasingly makes it look like Uber is following its competitors lead in Indias massive transportation market.The move also comes after Uber suffered a setback in Indias capital region, Delhi, where its application to run taxis in the area was rejected by the regions government. While no similar move has been made in Bengaluru, the companys decision to go ahead with a major launch a week later is indicative of Ubers historical indifference to government opinions.While Uber is predicting an increasingly rosy future in India, recent moves by the company show it has quite the challenge. The company is devotinga huge slice of resources to India where it has a tough battle against both rivals and the culture of the local market.
