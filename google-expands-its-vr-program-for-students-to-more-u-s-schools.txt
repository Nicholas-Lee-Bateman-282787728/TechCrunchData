Earlier this year, Google announced its so-called Expeditions Pioneer Program. This projectaims to bring Googles Cardboard VR viewer to students by bringing a full kit of gear forusing virtual reality in the classroom to schools.Google started rolling this program out to select schools in September and now its ready to expand this program to more schools in the U.S., with other countries to follow.Using these kits, students can then explore more than 120 locations that range from Antarcticato a rainforest. As Google announced today, more than 100,000 students have already used Expeditions in their classes. Now the program is coming to schools inAlexandria, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Detroit, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Washington DC.Google also plans to bring the program to Canada, Denmark and Singapore soon (thats on top of the previously announced schools for its pilot program in Australia, the UK and Brazil).The Expeditions kits include ASUS smartphones and a tablet for the teacher, as well as a router to connect all of the devices (and run the Expeditions app offline when theres no connectivity), as well as either Google Cardboard or Mattel View-Master VR viewers.Teachers who are interested in using the Expeditions kits in their classes can sign up here.
