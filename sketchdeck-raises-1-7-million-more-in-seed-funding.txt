SketchDeck, a two-year-old, on-demand design service for marketing and sales teams, has raised $1.7 million in new funding. The round comes 10 months after the startup raised $500,000 from investors. Backers include Matrix Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital, Blue Capital, Arnold Capital and Flight VC.The appeal of SketchDeckwhich passed through the Y Combinator program in the winter of 2014is easy to grasp.The now eight-person, Sunnyvale, Ca.-based outfit works with 100 freelance designers who create everything for customers from slide deck design (to save that last-minute presentation) to complete company rebrands.SketchDecks pricing is transparent, too. Right now, most clients payfor explicit tiers of services, shelling out $600 per project on average, says the company.SketchDeck is also trying to nudge more of its 600-plus customers into monthly subscriptions  with some apparent success. According to co-founder and CEO Chris Finneral, about 35 percent of the companys revenue now comes from clients who useto pay forindividual projects but now use SketchDeck as their owndesign service. (Subscriptions start at $2,500 per month and the company expects to begin charging larger clients up to $20,000 a month in 2016.)SketchDeck doesnt collect a percentage from each of those transactions or subscriptions, as do many other freelance marketplaces. It instead pays its freelance designers an agreed-upon hourly rate.Finneral says SketchDeckjuggles thesedesign projects through machine learning and suggests the technology has become one ofSketchDecksbiggest competitive advantages.How do you coordinate hundreds of concurrent projects and figure out who should work on what? Thats the real secret thats been enabling us to scale, he says. We dont need humans to figure out who to assign a project or how to get it done on time.A related advantage, he says: Unlike someonline marketplaces, where a customer has to find the designer, as well as totry resolvingissues with that personwhen expectations arent met, SketchDecks technology not only figures out the best designer for a job and how long it should take, but if anything goes awry,SketchDeck will bring on another designer to ensure aproject remains on track.Thebig question for the companys investors might bewhether SketchDeck continues improving on its currentservice, or if it has broader ambitions down the road to expand beyond the world of content design.Perhaps unsurprisingly, SketchDeck wants to do both.Design will be our focus for the next two years at least, says Finneral, a former McKinsey consultant. Its an enormous, multibillion dollarmarket. But long term, I think aboutthe various ways machine learning could apply to other types of virtual work. We do see ourselves as building a platform that canhandle everything from a piece of analysis to an email campaign.
