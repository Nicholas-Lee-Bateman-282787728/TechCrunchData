Mobile carriers want toplay a centralrole in the Internet of Things  as the glue that links up connected objects and lets them communicate with each other  andnow they are funding a startup out of Francethat is making IoT networks a reality.Sigfox  owner and operator of a low-energy, low-cost cellular network dedicated only to connected objects  today confirmed that it has raised a round of $115 million (100 million). It plans to use the funding to build out its network across Europe, the U.S. and Asia.Sigfox has already built out its network inFrance, Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and is working on deploying soon in the U.S.Tellingly, the Series D roundbrings together a number of strategic investors including the Spanish, Korean and Japanese carriers Telefonica, SK Telecom and NTT DOCOMO (whose Ventures arm did the investing), and Frenchindustrial giants GDF SUEZ, Air Liquide and Eutelsat. Also participating wasElliott Management Corporation.Previously, Sigfox had raised about 30 million from investors that include Intel Capital, Partech and several other French investors.This looks to be one of the highest-ever rounds of funding for a French startup  a position that is somewhat skewed given the capex needed to build out cellular networks.This record $115 million round is a significant step in the development of our networks coverage all around the world. The trust of our investors and the dynamism of SIGFOXs team allow us to strengthen our position as the world leader in IoT communications, said Anne Lauvergeon, SIGFOXs chairman.The move to invest a lot of money in Sigfox comes at an interesting moment for the company, and also for the IoT industry.Large tech titanslike Google have made no secret of their interest in developing more connected products for the home and beyond, and thats before you consider the large number of consumer and industrial electronics companies that are also investing into this area, building not just connected hardware but also services to help them run.While Google has (yet!) to make a play as the network provider for such services, carriers have long positioned themselves as the natural heirs to the job of running the network that would connect these objects  after all, they already have the data networks in place. In that context, Sigfox has beentaking a different approach that throws carriers entitlementinto some question.The companys network is built only to run data traffic for connected objects, and by architecting it this way, its calibrated to cover much larger geographies for much lower costs. Without the network strains of traditional cellular data traffic, Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) connectivity, as it is called, is significantly cheaper and easier to deploy and run than, for example, WCDMA deployments (theGSM-based3G network format).As a regular reminder of its purpose and superiority, onits homepage, Sigfox constantly updateshow much energy it conserves compared to traditional GSM, while also tallying up how many messages are sent across its network (now approaching 192 million).It looks like now, carriers and satellite companies are interested in joining Sigfox (or complementing it) rather than trying to beat it.As for the industrial investors, it looks like GDF Suez and Air Liquide will be contributing some of its latest developments in energy management. Like many oil companies, its making a major effort to invest in alternative energy use partly out of social responsibility, but also partly because they must consider how they might diversify their businesses in the longer term.Sigfoxs technology and network, thanks to its significant deployment, perfectly suits our needs for a part of our smart devices,especially in terms of energy efficiency for long-distance communication, said a spokesperson fromALIAD, the corporate venture capital arm of Air Liquide.
