Ford was one of the first major car manufacturers to bring connected car technology to its lineup with Sync in 2007, but while the first iterations of its Sync and  later  MyFord Touch infotainment systems were ahead of their time in the car world, they were also rather slow, cluttered and clunky.Sync 3, which is now available on the 2016 Ford Escape compact SUV and Fiesta subcompact, is a welcome departure fromall of that.Instead of trying to be innovative for the sake of it, Sync 3 goes back to the basics and provides drivers withan infotainment system that stays out of the way and simply works.Ford lent me a 2016 Escape earlier this month to get some hands-on experience with the new system.The last two iterations of Sync (the technology) and MyFord Touch (the touch-screen based interface to it) were based on Microsoft Auto.After reviewers and consumers panned the first version, the company decided that it wanted to give drivers the opportunity to update their cars to the next version. That, however, meant that Ford was able to make a lot of software changes that made the last version significantly better than the first (though still far from great), but stuck withthe same slow hardware to ensure compatibility.Ford switched to BlackBerrys QNX for Sync 3 and while switching screens and zooming around the built-in navigation system doesnt quite feel as smooth as on an iPad just yet, everything still feels plenty fast. In earlier versions, it sometimes felt like you were fighting against the system  now it works with you.Sync 3 is a complete redesign of the earlier versions. Its focuson large icons and easy to read text makes using the system about as easy as using an 8-inch touchscreen while driving gets.For the most part, all of the most often used features like climate and volume control still have physical counterparts on the center stack and wheel (at least in the Escape I drove).For changing the volume, those physical knobs will always remain easier to use than screens, but when it comes to navigation or interacting with apps, Fordsfocus on a utilitarian design over fanciful flourishes helps you to get things done fast and your eyes back on the road.Voice control, of course, is also always an option (and probably the safer one). Over the years, Ford has gotten better at this, but dont expect a Siri- or Google-like experience. You cant just start chatting with Sync. OK Sync, please set the temperature to 72 degrees wont get you very far (but Sync 3 integrates with Siris Eyes Free feature if you have an iPhone).Sync still needs you tostick to a small set of pre-programmed voice commands. Voice recognition works extremely well, butI tend to find using voicemore distracting than just changing the temperature by hand.Like the rest of the system, the navigation feature (which costs an extra $795) does exactly what it is meant to do (and you can get updates over WiFiwhen youre at home). It now features lane guidance, which wasnt all that useful on our trip to the Oregon coast, but makes a world of difference when youre driving through a new city.Unlike other car makers, Ford always bet that drivers would bring their own connectivity and apps to the car. Sync 3 is no exception. Like in previous versions, a small number of approved apps like Pandora, Spotify, Glympse and iHeartRadio can interact with Sync directly and let you interact with them using the touchscreen and physical controls. My trusty old Nexus 5 had some issues connecting over Bluetooth at first, but once it did, everything worked as advertised.With Sync 3, Ford has finally released an infotainment system that brings together all of thedisparate technologies it developed over the last few years (Sync  which actually debuted in 2007, MyFord Touch, and AppLink forconnecting the car to apps on your phone) into a single platform.While it was one of the first to offer these technologies, otherscar makers now offer similar functionality. Ford says Sync 3 may support Apples CarPlay and Android Car in the future, but its unclear when/if that will happen.For now, one thing is clear:Sync 3 isa reason to give Ford another look if youre in the market for a new car  and thats not something I wouldve said about its first iterations.
