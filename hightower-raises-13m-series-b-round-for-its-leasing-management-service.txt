While much of the recent startup action has focused on residential real estate thanks to startups like Porch andHouzz (as well as existing players like Zillow and Redfin), commercial real estate has remained under the radar.Hightower, which was founded in 2013, makes it easier for commercial brokers and owners to manage the leasing process from beginning to end.
