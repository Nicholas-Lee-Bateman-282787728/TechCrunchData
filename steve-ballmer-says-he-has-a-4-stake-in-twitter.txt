Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer now owns not only the Los Angeles Clippers, but a big chunk of Twitter as well.Ballmer earlier this morning disclosed that he owned 4% of Twitter in a Tweet. His share purchases apparently came over the course of the past few months. At Twitters current valuation of $20.76 billion, that stake is worth around $830 million.Good job @twitter,@twittermoments innovation, @jack Ceo, leaner, more focused. Glad I bought 4% past few months. Like @alwaleedbinT move too Steve Ballmer (@Steven_Ballmer) October 16, 2015There was a little bit of confusion around whether the Tweet was real, but Ballmer has apparently confirmed his ownership to Bloomberg directly. Shares of Twitter were up around 3% this morning after trading opened on the news.In particular, Ballmer pointed to Twitters new Moments product,which launched earlier this month. Moments is centered around bigstories on Twitter, such as the Mets advancing to the NationalLeague Championship Series, that users can flip through to see various Tweets that are relevant to those stories.Still, theres a tricky element coming up: Dorsey will continue to run Square, which filed its S-1 this week, signaling its intent to go public  in theory, sometime later this year. But earlier this month, Ballmer already signaled his faith in Dorsey in another Tweet (which were assuming is real, given Ballmers confirmation that the account is real to Bloomberg).I think @twitter is remarkable. There is amazing chance to innovate and grow. Excited to see progress with @jack as CEO  Impressive dude!
