The Bay Area is well-acquainted with boom and bust cycles, and while its too soon to declare that the tech economy has turned, recruiters see early indicators that its happening.Indeed, a handful ofjob placement executives confirmswhat recent headlines about layoffs already imply: The market is softening for numerous sectors of the startup world, as well as at publicly traded tech companies. (See chart below.)Ithasnt always been this way. Until recently, recruiters have been workingfast and furiously to place a whole range of executives.Numbers from Californias Employment Development Department illustrate part of the story. In October, for example, the Bay Area accounted for 40 percent of all job growth in California, even thoughit represents less than 20 percent of the states population.Data in December only hintsat a shift, with the overall number of employed Californians down just 10,000 from November, according to the same state agency.Still, recruiters largely believe the situation is starting to change, particularly for certain jobs.I think what were seeing is bigger than a small correction, says Paul Gomory, an executive recruiter whos been placing C-level professionals for more than 30 years and seen his share of cycles. Everyone thinks it will be different this time, but it never is.The resumes beginning to show up in recruiters inboxes vary, but they say agrowing number are from business development and corporate development executives. Teri McFadden, VP of recruiting at Norwest Venture Partners, believes a slowing funding environment is largelyto blame.I think companies that had planned to grow through acquisitions dont have the war chest they thought they would, she says; its leaving those professionals with a lot less to do.Ali Behnam, cofounder of the 15-year-old, San Francisco-based placement firm Riviera Partners, echoes McFaddensobservation, telling us that when it comes tobusiness development specifically, I think people are more cautious in terms of hiring for those specific roles because they cost money to make money.There are other roles whose outlook looks cloudier suddenly, too.Asthe public market cools, for instance, demand for executives with public market experience is abating. Though McFadden says shes not seeing the wholesale shutdowns or layoffs in Norwests portfolio, shes aware of some belt-tightening, including companies that are delaying hires like [bringing aboard] CFOs with public company experience and deciding instead to stick with their private companies VPs of finance for now. Youre seeing that decision get pushed out another 12 months.Recruiters themselves may face issues.Good recruiters will continue to have opportunities, saysMcFadden, who spentthe late 90s as a recruiter for Accel Partners. They wont be able to raisetheir fees as they have in the last couple of years, though, she says.Publicrelations firmswhich have been charging their mid-size tech clients anywhere from $15,000 to $50,000 a monthmay also feel the sting soon, says a separate source who asked not to be namedbut tells of atleast one name-brand PR firm that recently lowered its retainer.Thats saying nothing oflower performers who are being managed out, as notesMark Lonergan, founder ofhis own,14-year-old, Redwood City, Ca.-based executive search firm, which caters to both venture-backed and public company clients.Companies arent replacing staff when staff goes away, either.Fortunately,there are some bright spots.For his part, Behnam says he doesnt see anything slowing in the engineering world. Those guys are still in high demand. (Benham also says he has been through the 2001 and 2008 downturns, and that this doesnt feel like those  yet.)Top executives are also still highly desirable, unsurprisingly. Im looking for the topfivepercent, and those guys and gals have a job if they want one, says Gomory.Portfolio CEOs are still complaining about the war for talent, addsMcFadden. That may change, she notes, but well-qualified people wont be at a loss for a job.Benham also says employees of public companies that once had sky-high valuations are now more open to hearing about opportunities.He notes that employees at LinkedIn arent feeling as flush after the companys stock was recently hammered. (It fell more than 40percentearlier this month; the shares, trading currently at $117 apiece, have recovered only slightly.)Lonergan seems less certain how that trend will play out, however. The problem, hesays, is, Where are these people going to go that offers the same level of compensation?Public company employees dont have it so great right now, Lonerganacknowledges. Inaddition to plummeting share prices,pay packages at tech companies are shrinking by a somewhat surprising20 to25 percent from early 2015, he says.Even still, Lonergan sayshethinks itunlikely that many public company employees will jump into venture-backed outfitsunless forced out the door.With private valuations falling more quickly than public ones, its just hard to see where these companies are going.Chart:Datafox.
