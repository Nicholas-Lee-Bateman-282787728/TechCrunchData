Microsoft announced its Q2 2016 results yesterday, reporting strong performance for its cloud business and leading to a stock bump in the wake of the news.Its Surface tablet hardware business also performed well.Howeverits an entirely differentstory for theunloved phone-making business  that albatross around Steve Ballmer Satya Nadellas neck. Buried low down in the earnings report, Redmondnotes phone revenue declined 49% in constant currency  couching this as a reflection of our strategy change announced in July 2015.Microsoft can couch away all it wants, but the truth is itsphone business is dead. And no amount ofstrategic fiddling around the edges willchange that. Indeed, the platform hasbeen walking dead for multiple years now.To underline how muchthe Windows (ne Windows Phone) smartphone project has collapsed here are the year over year sales figuresA spot of comparative context: just this week Apple announced it sold 75 million iPhones in its Q1. (And that in a quarter without significantiPhonesales growth for Cupertino.)#WIndows smartphone Market share 2007 12%, 2008 11%, 2009 9%, 2010 5%, 2011 3%, 2012 3%, 2013 3%, 2014 3% and now 2015 down to 2% #Lumia Tomi Ahonen (@tomiahonen) January 29, 2016Sorry, Windows Phone. 110m lifetime sales  4.5bn iOS & Android phones sold in the same period pic.twitter.com/CO03XWhYJg Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) January 28, 2016Of course weve known that Windows Phone has beenwalking dead for years now, given its failure to achieve significant traction outside a handful of European markets. In the U.S. the platform never took off. And even in European markets like Italy where it saw some small gains Microsoft has been unable to turn regional glimmers of growth intoanything vaguely resembling sustained momentum.To paraphraseMonty Python, Windows Phone isan ex-platform.Sure,Microsoft might say the platform is just resting. But consumers know the truth: its a dead parrot.So #Microsoft #Lumia ex #Nokia #Windows Phone smartphone biz? DISASTER. Down 22% in just THREE months to 4.5M and 1.1% market share Tomi Ahonen (@tomiahonen) January 29, 2016I told you its this year or latest next when #Lumia #Windows Phone will be shut down. Its a dead phone walking #Microsoft #evilempire #ms Tomi Ahonen (@tomiahonen) January 29, 2016The question now is whether Microsoft will keep making smartphonesas a showcase/vanity project. Or just kill off the division entirely.Opinion is divided on that front, although given how many phone-related staff Microsoft has given the chopto alreadyit is already pretty far down that path oftotalfocusEither way, one thing is absolutelyclear: consumers arent going to be buyingsmartphones running Windows.Because peopleknow a dead parrot when they see one.
