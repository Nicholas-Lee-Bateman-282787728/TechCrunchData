If youre one of the tech professionals who has gotten an email fromBloomberg Betaidentifying you as a future founder and inviting you to dinner, dont worry, its not a hoax.The venture arm of the media and information servicesgiantBloomberg is just at it again;continuing its grand experiment in data-driven outreach to folks the firm thinks have the mettle to become the leaders of tomorrows startups.Last year, the firm sent emails to 350 people it identified as most likely to start a company, and invited them to an inaugural event  a tradition the firm is continuing.And their hit rate isnt so bad. At least one of their invitees (who, admittedly, had already been introduced to Bloomberg Betas chief, Roy Bahat) actually launched one of the most buzzed about companies of 2014.I met up with him in early 2014 and got some advice, says Product Huntchief executive Ryan Hoover. It was a really interesting approach to investing and at least looking at the market. Its an interesting trend in general how investors are trying to get earlier and earlier into the funnel.As competition increasesandmoney becomes a commodity,venture investors are looking for any and all ways to get in front of promising entrepreneurs.Bloomberg Betas approach yielded introductions to at least 8 entrepreneurs, including Hoover and one other company that the firm has backed(but remains undisclosed).Roughly three-quarters of the talent pool that the firm identified as potential entrepreneurs last year came from the West Coast while 25% were from New York. That bias reflects the firms focus and is also predicated on a key metric for entrepreneurial vim and vigor, according to Bahat  having worked at a startup previously.Yup, you read that correctly, apparently the main motivator for starting up a new company in the tech sector is workingat a new company in the tech sector, according to Bloombergs founder data.And even if Bloombergs potential future founders dont go on to start their own company, the firm found that theyre still players in the industry.Around half of the 350 people the firm identified switched jobs within the year, and another significant percentage received major promotions, Bloomberg partner Karin Klein told me.Another interesting tidbit from this years group of invitees (and one that both bodes well for the industry and echoes reporting from CrunchBase we published yesterday) is the rising number of women among the potential entrepreneurs.The big thing for this year thats different in the results is that we looked at the gender of the predicted group this year, says Bahat. The predicted rate of female founders is double the current rate.According to Bloomberg Betas data, around 20% of the potential founders the venture firm is contacting will be women.Out of the analysis the data actually speaks for itself and it will be an encouraging sign that enough women have the backgrounds that they are in the position to start companies.Now more women have a background which suggests that theyll start venture backed companies, says Klein.If youre one of the lucky few, or you just want to read what a form letter to a would-be founder looks like, heres the text from last years note below.
