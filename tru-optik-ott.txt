Andre Swanston, CEO of Tru Optik, argued that theres been one big obstacle to advertising on Internet-connected TVs  measurement.Naturally, Swanston is pitching Tru Optiks technology as the solution. The company started out by measuring how video content gets shared through peer-to-peer file sharing, but has since expanded into a broader measurement solution, with products like its own data management platform. Now its launching a new service to help media companies and advertisers measure the viewership on Internet-connected TV apps, with help from data provider Experian Marketing Services.Swanston said were going to be seeing more media companies launching their own connected TV apps, sincetheres no technological barrier to entry.The economics are changing such that youre going to be seeing a lot more people focusing their energy on that, he added.Tru Optik, on the other hand, has created what Swanston described as a household-level device graph. In other words, it has created a unique (but anonymized) identifier for each household, allowing it to see when multiple devices are used by one family, and then track content consumption across those devices.On top of that, its using Experian data to understand audience demographics and purchase behavior.Swanston added that Tru Optik isnt just for helping track ad impressions, but can also more broadly help media companies show the value of their videos for things like product placement and licensing. And for consumers, he suggested that this approach is better for privacy, as it lets you opt out of certain types of targeting at a household level.
