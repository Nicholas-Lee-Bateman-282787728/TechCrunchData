Yahoo bought Polyvore in what weve heard could be anywhere from a $25 million* to $60 million** deal today. Both Polyvore and Yahoo were mum on those details, but Polyvore co-founder Jess Lee did tell TechCrunch her company will continue to do the same thing as its been doing before  now on a larger scale and with more resources from the tech giant run by Marissa Mayer.We also think theres a lot of exciting opportunities to integrate and combine forces with the digital magazines, such as Yahoo Style and Yahoo Beauty, Lee said.Polyvore will remain a standalone product, according to Lee, but she will now report to Yahoo SVP of publisher products Simon Khalaf, who reiterated the community integration aspect of the deal.Every time weve seen an integrated community weve seen magical things happen, Khalaf said. Weve seen it in Yahoo Sports, weve seen it in Yahoo Finance and we definitely see that in Polyvore and the great product that the Polyvore team has built.This also gives Polyvore another avenue to monetize. By partnering with Yahoo we can roll out our ad platform across the Yahoo network by integrating with Yahoo Gemini, Lee said.Polyvore has partnered with Yahoo on a few other projects, and Lee told TechCrunch talks of the deal started from there. We should also note that three ex-Yahoo engineers  Jianing Hu, Guangwei Yuan and Pasha Sadri  started Polyvore back in 2007.When asked why this was the time to sell, Lee said it was the right time and the right amount and that she was very, very happy with the outcome.*A tip sent to us after we published suggested the deal was closer to $25 million. Another source told us the deal was for $25 million in cash, $20 million in RSUs to employees and a $15 million tranche set aside for senior execs.**According to other outlets the purchase price was anywhere from $200 million to $230 million.
