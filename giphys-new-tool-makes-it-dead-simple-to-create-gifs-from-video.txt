Earlier this month, Giphy COO Adam Leibsohn told me that Giphy has a bunch of new tools up its sleeves to help people make their own GIFsin a matter of seconds.Well, GIF Makermust be one of them. The tool, which launched today, gives you a super easy way to make GIFsfrom YouTube videos and other video files.Back in the day, I used to have to download a Mac-only app called GifGrabber to turn videos into GIFs. Its pretty easy to use, but Giphys new GIF MAKER is a lot easier and more accessible to the masses. Also, it turns out that GifGrabber Co-Founder Andy Hin is a senior engineer at Giphy, so it makes sense that Giphy integrated the best of GifGrabber into GIF Maker.Check it out.GIF Maker comes about a month after Giphy launched GiphyCam, a standalone mobile app for creating your own GIFs. Giphys big plan is to become a full-on media company, Leibsohn told me earlier this month.So, well essentially become this one-stop shop to find and distribute and host and create, he said at the time.Giphy launched out of betaworks in 2013, and has since raised $17 million at an $80 million valuation.
