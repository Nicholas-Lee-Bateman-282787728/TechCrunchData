Harry Stebbings is the founder and host of The Twenty Minute VC
, an independent podcast focused on venture capital. Last week I had the chance to speak with Jeff Seibert, Senior Director of Product at Twitter and Co-Founder of Crashlytics (acquired by Twitter for $259m) and one of the main individuals leading the new guard at Twitter.In what turned out to be a reflective interview we discussed a range of topics including what it was like raising VC money in 2009, why being overly transparent with your team can be a hindrance and why Jeff decided selling Crashlytics to Twitter was the best option, allowing them to be deployed on over 1 billion devices.Seibert also discussed the need for startups to negotiate for continued investment in their product by their acquirer in acquisition talks; at what stage runway startups should look to go and raise again;what life is like at Twitter following the acquisition of Crashlytics  and the next 5 years for him and the Twitter product?
