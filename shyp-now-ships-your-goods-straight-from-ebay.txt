Just in time for the high holy season ofgiving and getting packagesfrom far away, on-demand shipping startup Shyp is taking advantage of one of the biggestonlineoutfits in need of deliveryfor those packages eBay.Much like when PayPal first offered a third-party payment system for the the e-commerce site, Shyp hopesto be the third-party shipping provider, with a promise to sellers of no waiting in line at the post office and no assembling and stuffing boxes.Stamps.com tries to make the first part of that easy forsellers by offering a postage machine in the convenience of their home. eBay also started offering an international shipping program in 2012, but unless the seller uses a drop shipping service, they still have to packageand send it off themselves.eBay buyersrate sellers on the quality and timeliness of their shipments for goods won so Shyps new addition could potentially help out sellers, especially around the holiday season.Exact numbers for how many sellers are currently on the site are scant, butthe company reported itsmost recent gross merchandise volume at $19.6 billion. The potential for Shyp is nothing to sneeze at, should the startup even get a fraction of those sellers profiting fromthe service.Its not unfathomable the startupcould extend this service to other e-commerce platforms with individual sellers like Amazon, which doubled its individual merchant numbers last year,or Alibaba  which broke nearly $6 billion in sales during this years singles day.Shyps new service works in a similar fashion to the regular service on the app. According to a Shyp post:The eBay integration will continue after the holidays, but is free to sellers till January 31, 2016.
