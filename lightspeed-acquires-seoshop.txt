Lightspeed POS is announcing that it has acquired SEOshop, an Amsterdam-based maker of e-commerce software.As the name implies, Lightspeeds offerings for brick-and-mortar retailers and restaurants include a point-of-sale system, as well as inventory management, a customer database and more. It also offers tools for creating a web store, but founder and CEO Dax Dasilva said the acquisition will allow his company to expand significantly on that front.For starters, the SEOshop product is being rebranded as LightSpeed eCom, and there areplans to launch fuller integration with Lightspeeds platform early next year.Dasilva says this is the first timeLightspeed has offered products for online-only businesses, though he also suggested those businesses coulduse the webas a way to test the waters before opening a physical location.And for businesses that do operate aphysical location or locations, the e-commerce option could help them to sell everywhere even if you cant have retail stores everywhere.Over time, we dont see we see the retail and e-comm as different sales channels for the same retailer, but rather as different ways to reach the customer, Dasilva added.Lightspeed acquired Belgium-based point-of-sale company POSIOS last year, but Dasilva said this is the companys biggest acquisition so far, and with it, LightSpeed now has 34,000 customers.The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. SEOshop last raised a 1.1 million euro round from Henq.
