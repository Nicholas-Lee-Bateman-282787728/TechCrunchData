Youve probably heard of the social graph and the interest graph. Now a startup called ShuttleCloud says its trying to help developers with unlocking the email graph.By email graph, ShuttleCloud means the contacts and the relationships buried within your email, according to Bob Greenlees, the companys director of operations and business development. He told me that ShuttleCloud has already been working some big customers, including Google and Comcast, but now its makingthe technology available to a wider range of developers through its API.On a basic level, ShuttleCloud (which was incubated at TechStars) makes it easier to integrate online address books intoan appson-boarding and growth process. For example, if you build a social app and want users to invite their email contacts to join, you could try to build integrationswith all the likely email services  or you could just use the ShuttleCloud API, which the company says can currently import address books from 242 email providers. (I havent seen anything that competes directly with ShuttleCloud, but the pitch reminded me of other companies that are building integration tools fordevelopers  for example,mParticle aims to be the single integration point for mobile data.)These toolscould be helpful for an early-stage startup with limited resources, but Greenlees said that these integrations can still be a pain for larger companies, particularly when they want to expand internationally (which can involvesupporting a whole new list of email providers).And as I hinted above, the broader vision goes beyond importing contacts. Greenlees said ShuttleCloud wants to provide insights to help customers take advantage of the fact that email isa really rich source of data. So in the invite your friends example above, instead of just presenting you with a long list of contacts, ShuttleCloud might suggest the friends who are most likely to say yes to aninvite.Asked about the privacy implications, Greenlees responded, Its the users data.This is just enabling the user to take that data with them. Fair enough, but doesntinbox have data about other people, too?The type of insights thatwere able to draw are not something that would surprise the individual user or the recipient of the invite  like, how frequently theyre contacting each other, he said. He also argued that with this data, ShuttleCloud shouldenable smarter, more personal communication, rather than email blasts that go to everyone in your address book and feel spammy.
