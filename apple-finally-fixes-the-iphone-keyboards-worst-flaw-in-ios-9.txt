Its the little things in life.Like, you know, being able to tell if your keyboard is currently set to use capital letters or not.With iOS 9, Apple is finally fixing one of the platforms strangest quirks: the keyboard will no longer appear to be all caps, all the time.If youre an Android user, or someone who just doesnt think about stuff like this all that much, you might have no idea what Im talking about.You see, in all builds of iOS thus far, the keyboard always uses capital letters to represent each key  whether or not youve actually hit shift or have caps lock on.That works well enough on physical keyboards  for the most part, youre holding the shift key when you want shift turned on.On a touchscreen keyboard, where you tap shift instead of hold, its not so simple. Sometimes you tap shift and forget, or tap it on accident. Sometimes the keyboard rolls into view with shift on by default.To date, iOS has shown youre in shift/caps lock by changing the color of the shift key from grey to white. The end result: a whole lot of Wait. Crap. Shift is greyd out. Does that mean shift is on, or that shift is off? The letters are big so Oh well, better tap a key to test it.No more!iOS 9 is currently in beta, but its the first major iOS beta that is available for public (read: non-developer) consumption.[hat tip to BI for noticing this]
