One of the most frustratingthings about living inan urban high-rise buildingis the close quarters you are forced to share with neighbors. However, one startup is trying to turn this annoyance into a benefit by letting you utilize your network of neighbors to acquire services and goods.Founded in NYC, Tenant King believes that by connecting a user with neighbors in high-rise buildings, they can createa trusted network thatcanreplace standalone services like Airbnb or Craigslist.Currently operating in 400 buildings in New York, Tenant King employs a strict address verification process, which the company says helps maintain users trust in the service.While similar services like Nextdoor will simplylet another neighbor vouch for you, Tenant King requires a user to verify their address by either receiving a physical verification code in the mail, scanning a utility bill, or letting the company authorize a credit card that is linked to yourbilling address.Once being accepted into your buildings network, you canaccess classified adswhere neighbors offer anything from subletting to large furniture for sale.As the company explained to TechCrunch, Tenant Kings benefit comes from the fact that some transactions are better off being done within your own building.For example, furniture or other large items are more likely to actually be sold on Tenant King, as buyers dont have to worry about shipping ortransport. Patrik Misko, co-founder of the company, said thatin some buildings almost 50 percent of of listings end in successful transactions.While currently only available in New York, Tenant King will soon be available in high-rise buildings in other major U.S. cities.
