StarVR was undoubtedly overshadowed by larger names during its debut at E3 last year, but those who did manage to demo the high-end headset seemed to walk away impressed.Among other things, Starbreezes hardware device offers a wider field of view than either Oculus or HTC, at 210 degrees to those devices 110. Thats courtesy of two Quad HD panels, bringing an extremely impressive combined resolution 5,120 x 1,440 (here the Rift and Vive each clock in at 2,160 x 1,200).The game studio announced this week that its enlisting Acer as a hardware partner for the headset. The companies will collaborate on designing, manufacturing and promoting the tech, according to the deal, bringing StarVR to the professional- and location-based entertainment market, language that sounds as if the headset will be focused onmarkets outside the Rift and Vives livingroom demographic.Not a huge surprise, really, given the high-end specs and, likely, a price to match.Acers CEO Jason Chen added that the company has already been priming its line of PCs for the StarVR experience, explaining in a statement, We are devoting R&D resources across multiple aspects of the VR ecosystem for a coherent and high-quality experience, while just last month Acer announced powerful desktops and notebooks fully-ready for StarVR.
