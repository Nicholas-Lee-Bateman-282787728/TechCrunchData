Last year TechCrunch Disrupt London really blew the doors off with an incredible conference. London continues to be a fantastic bridge between Europe and Silicon Valley. So it was not a hard decision for us to bring TechCrunch Disrupt, our major conference, back for a third time running.Disrupt is unlike any other tech conference out there. It pits its journalists against major speakers and grills them for all they are worth. In fact, speakers love this engagement, and so do attendees. It also attracts major media outlets including The Financial Times, Bloomberg, CNBC and the BBC.Plus Startups win from all this attention, from being on our Battlefield stage, to exhibiting in the Startup Alley.So here are the details:TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016 will (once again) be held at the Copper Box Arena in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on December 5th to 6th.You can already get Extra Early Bird tickets here.It will be open to any startup from anywhere in the world.
