Gifs are a diverse bunch, theres onelike ten million for everything you could ever think of but theyre pretty hard to find and the process for posting them is a little harder than it should be.Thats why gif keyboards are so popular  they allow rapid access to the Internets library of moving images and you dont have to go far to find them. Unfortunately, most of them arent all that great, but Giffage just unveiled one that may be the best one out there.Instagram superstar Elliot Tebele, better known by his social media moniker Fuck Jerry, is a bit of a gif Jedi. Hesmade a career scouring the Internet and reposting gifsand hecurrently boasts 6.9 million followers on Instagram, with sizable presences on Twitter and Tumblr as well.Tebele collaborated on this 3.0 version of Giffage and was introduced to me as a co-founder, but followingthe new update, Tebele really has a chance to take the app mainstream as he utilizeshis massivefollowing and status as a memewizard to lend the app some Internet street cred.Thats highly necessary as the applooks to distinguish itself in a product field thats been growing increasingly crowded lately, with offerings from gif powerhouses like Giphy.Giffage founder Jack Shalom detailed thathe had wanted to build a gif app that did it all. Gif keyboards (that are just okay) have been steadily gaining popularity in the past fewmonths, but for the most part theyve been introduced through single-feature apps that allow you to enable them but dont give you much more functionality beyond that.Most of the public still doesnt really know how to use [all of these apps], and I dont think people aregoing to go out and download five different apps, said Shalom. Thats the issue.Doing it all meant introducing their own keyboard, and Shalom says his team has spent a lot of time putting all of their efforts towardbuilding out a gif keyboard thats really just the best one available.Luckily for Giffage this keyboard really is freaking awesome, allowing users to scour apps by categories, search specifically for their favorites (powered by Giphy), browse trending gifs or their own saved (called hearted) gifs, make theirown gifs through the app or easily type away on the keyboard without having to switch back to the standard iOS variety.What makes this gif keyboard so noteworthy is that everything flows so nicely, and youre allowed great access to find the gif you want in that exact moment effortlessly.Giffage also introduced a new feature called Wallet that allows you to save any gif you see directly to the hearted section of the keyboard for later use. To users rocking the latest iPhones, Giffage also enables users to convert their fancy new Live Photos into gif files and enable more effective sharing across devices.Speaking of new iPhones, this version of Giffage also adds in 3D Touch capabilities, allowing usersquick access to search and other key features right from the home screen.There are plenty of decent gif keyboards out there, but whenits really important that Ifind the best crying Kim Kardashian gif at a moments notice, Giffage is there for me.Check outversion 3.0 of Giffage now in the App Store.
