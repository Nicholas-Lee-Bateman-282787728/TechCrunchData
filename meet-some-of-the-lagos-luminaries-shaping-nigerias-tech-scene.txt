President Barack Obama may be the most famous citizen of the United States traveling around Africa this week, but hes not the only one.Its nearly 4:30 in the morning here in Lagos and Im too excited to sleep. Later today Im going to get a chance to sit on a stage with some ofthe best and brightest in Nigerias burgeoning tech scene for a pitch competition and the chance to give one lucky startup a spot in Startup Alley atTechCrunch Disrupt London 2015.Nigerias got a growing e-commerce market, powered by the countrys 173.6 million strong population and an expanding base of smart phone users and served by startups like Konga, the countrys answer to Amazon.But as one of Africas cultural hubs (the Nigerian film industry known as Nollywood is popular from Nairobi to New York) the countrys entrepreneurs are about more than just the art of the sale.As Jake Bright, one of our guest authors,wrotein a piece for Crunch Network:Countries such as Nigeria are in the midst startup booms. In Africas most populous nation and largest economy hundreds of online portals are popping up to provide just about every commercial service and solve any business problem.There are rst-time dotcoms for fashion (Fashpa), digital payments (Paga), shipping (ACE  AfricaCourier Express), employment (Jobberman), airline bookings, and digital movies and music (SOLO).Ive already been affected by the crazy energy that comes from spending time in what has to be one of Africas most populous (and most frenetically paced) cities.Im only two days into my trip here, but Ican pretty safely say that theres nothing anywhere that can compare to Lagos (or match its feverish entrepreneurial energy).Its all so overwhelming that Imjust feeling lucky tobe sharing the stage with a star-studded group of Nigerian entrepreneurial talent who can help me make sense of it all.Heres a rundown of my fellow judges:Bola Akindeleis theFounder and Group Managing Director of Technology companyCourteville Business Solutions, which was founded in 2004 as Courteville Investment Ltd.
