Heres an intriguing move: crowdfunding platformKickstarter has commissioned a freelance journalist to investigate and ultimately (it hopes)explain  the collapseof a high profile drone project which wasalso themost funded European project to date.The immediate audience for the article isthe more than 12,000veryirate backers who collectively pledged more than 2.3 million in the hopes of being shippedan autonomousmicro drone called Zanothis summer.But it will also be made publicly availableso anyone can read the lessons contained therein.The Zano drone was billed asintelligent enough to fly all by itself when it launched on Kickstarter in November 2014, with the team toutingon-board sensors for obstacle detection and avoidance  which they claimed would also enable other advanced features such asthe ability for multiple Zanos to fly together in a swarm. Given that micro drones have been in the market for years, theautonomous element wasZanos primarydifferentiator.The company was still claiming it was on target with its development schedule at the end of May. In an email to TechCrunch on May 31, Zanos marketing and business development director Reece Crowther wrote: The good news, were on target with our development schedule and expect to be in a position to supply production ZANOs by June-end/Early-July.Crowther also offered to give a full demo of the drone, and sent links to two videos apparently showing the Zanos obstacle avoidance tech in action, and detailing how the latest stage of development was progressing (both videos are no longer availableas the companys YouTube account has been closed).The problem was their tech claims never panned out and the drone never shipped. The hardware was still clearly far from readywhen the BBC visited the firm in Wales to get a demo in August 2015. The news organization reported that it watched thedrone fail to function outdoors and found it could only fly indoorsfor around five minutes before running out ofbattery.Nevertheless, the company is determined to start shipping the Zano to backers at the end of this week, wrote the BBCs Rory Cellan-Jones at the end of August.Zanodid not ship the following week. AndtheCEO of the business resigned in November, citing personal health issues and irreconcilable differences. The companycollapsed into voluntary liquidation shortly afterwards  leaving Kickstarter with a PR disaster on its hands.If youre in the storytelling business, as Kickstarter is by proxy  given its a platform for storytellers to sell their ideas  then figuring out a way to create satisfying narratives when things go wrong is a smart move. Although there still remains arisk that some critical analysismight end up being directed at Kickstarter itself. But if its seen to be tryingto learn from itsmistakes thats at least a better look than silence and the perception offailures being swept under the carpet.Explaining the commission in a Medium post, the journalist in question  Mark Harris  says Kickstarter is paying him for his services, and will be seeing the article before its published (likely in mid-January). However he claimsthe company wont have any editorial control or input intothe content of what he writes.Looking into Kickstarters role in the project is a specific part of the commission, according to Harris.He writes:Kickstarter has asked me to lay out the progress of the project, from start to finish; to discover what happened to the over 2m in funds pledged; and to answer the questions of whether Zanos creators could have done anything differently, or made mistakes that future Kickstarter projects might avoid.I will also be looking into Kickstarters role in the project, and whether it could have served Zanos creators or backers better throughout. Crucially, although Kickstarter is paying me (up front) to research and write this story, and will be able to see it before it is sent to the backers or published, the company has no right to make any suggestions or changes to my copy. I have no other connection to the company, nor to anyone on the Zano team, and have no particular axe to grind.While Kickstarter may haveno legal right to make any suggestions or changes to Harris report, there are potentially some blurred lines here given it is funding the article. Weve reached out to Harris with questions about the commissionand will update this story with any response.Update:Harris has now responded to our queries, confirming that the article will be a one-off, and saying he has no intention of working for Kickstarter again.I accepted this commission only after considering it for some time, and because it aligned closely with my journalistic interest and experience (drones, robotics, innovation, crowdfunding). I have no intention of this becoming a regular gig, or even happening again, and Kickstarter did not suggest this at any point, he tells TechCrunch.Harris does havea contract with Kickstarter for the article but says the companys legal team has advised him not to share the full contract, although he confirmsthere is an editorial freedom clause which states he can explore avenues of inquiry at his discretion  i.e. above and beyond trying to find out what happened with the project and to the money raised, and what (if anything) the project creators could have done to avoid failure.Quoting directly from this contractualclause he says it states: Writer shall present the Article to Kickstarter for review upon completion and prior to publication. Kickstarter shall have no right to make suggestions or request changes to the Article.Harris adds hewill retain copyright for the article, including reproduction rights.As for payment, he confirms the rate is generous although he characterizesit as by no means excessive for a feature of this size and complexity.Its a flat fee so hard to compare to the word rate I generally get for my stories. But if I waffle on a bit, as I am likely to, it will be equivalent to (or possibly even less than) the word rate I receive from several traditional editorial clients, he adds.Harrisis asking any Zano backers, creators or employeeswhod like toget in touch as he researches the story to email him atzano@meharris.com.The move by Kickstarter to commission an outsider to investigate a hardware failure comes hard on the heels of itlaunching a report on the proportion of projects that fail to ship on its platform  a reportwhich claims that justnine per cent of Kickstarter projects fail to deliver rewards.The so-called Fulfillment Report  well they werent going to call it the Failure Report  is billed as an independent analysis of failure rates on the platform.Another outsider, Professor Ethan Mollick, a scholar from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, was involved in helping to compile thisstudy (but not paid for his work). Although it appears that Kickstarter controlled theselection of random backer data the study is based on, and also co-developed the questions used to survey backers with Wharton, so Kickstartersinput into this independent report actually looks pretty involved.It will certainly be interesting to read whatHarris investigation turns up in the Zano case. High profile failures are undoubtedly a huge headache for crowdfunding platforms as they call intoquestion the sustainabilityof the entire category. So anything Kickstartercan do to reduce the perception of risk from using its platform  NB: there will always be actual risk when you pre-order a product that does not yet exist will be money well spent.Unlike, in this instance, themoney spent on the Zano Kickstarter campaign. As ever with crowdfunding the advice remains: caveat emptor.Update:In an email to TechCrunch, a Kickstarter spokesman said it decided to help backers get more information on why the Zano project failed after manyexpressed dissatisfaction about the amount of info they had beenfurnished with to explain what went wrong with the project.Healso pointed to Kickstartersterms of use, noting they set out a path for project creators to follow if a project is failing, and said theterms require creators of failed projects to come forward and explain what happened and how the money was used.Its up to the backers to determine whether the creator has handled this well. But in this case we heard from many backers who were not satisfied with the information they got about the projects failure. So we decided to help the backers get more information, headded.As well as providing Zano backers with some closure, the spokesmansaidKickstarterhopes Harris report will have additional utility to us at Kickstarter, to backers and creators in our community, and to anyone who wants to know more about how projects like this can run into trouble.
