Jay Vijayan,who spent four years as the Chief Information Officer of Tesla Motors, and who served as its VP of IT and business applications for a year before that, left the company in January to form his own Bay Area startup.Vijayan isnt talking yet about that company. (This reporter reached out to him last Monday and he hasnt responded.)But his departure comes at an interesting time, given the almost unprecedented excitement surrounding the Model 3 car that Tesla unveiled to the public last Thursday night.As you may have already read, the company had booked more than 253,000 orders in the first 36 hours after CEO Elon Musk revealed several prototypes in a showy display reminiscent of Apple product releases.That kind of demand is surely putting to the test a proprietary software system called Warp that Vijayan and his team of engineers at Tesla designed tosupport the companysdirect sales efforts in the U.S. (In 2014, the WSJ had taken a long look at the platform here.)Vijayan also appears to be doing some angel investing, which may or may not be relatedto his new startup. Last Monday, numerous India-basedoutlets reportedthatFixNix, a Bangalore-based governance, risk management, and compliance platform, hadraised $500,000 in seed funding led by Vijayan, along with other, unnamed, Silicon Valley-based angel investors.Certainly, Vijayan looks likely to be creatingenterprise software. Before joining Tesla, he spent five years at VMWare and seven years at Oracle.As noted by the outlet Electrek, Vijayans departure marks the second C-level change at Tesla within a few months time. The companyslongtime CFO Deepak Ahuja left the company late last year, saying heplanned to retire.
