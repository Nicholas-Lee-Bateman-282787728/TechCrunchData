TechCrunch Radio cant stop, wont stop. So you should just accept your fate and apply to be in the pitch-off. Or at the very least, tune in on Tuesday evenings to hang out with us. For those of you who dont yet know, TechCrunch Radio is an hour-long weekly radio show hosted by myself and East Coast Editor John Biggs that airs on Sirius XM 102 Indie and 103 Insight. We discuss the latest news of the week and then dive into our TechCrunch Radio Pitch-off, where five companies have the chance to pitch their startup to the world in sixty seconds or less. We usually invite a VC to guest judge, and even allow a wild-card company to call in on the fly to pitch their product. Its a lot of fun, but you have to apply to the pitch-off or follow along during the show (or on Twitter) to be involved. Deets below. Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome.
3. You must be able to pitch your product with your words only.
4. You must be able to operate a telephone.Apply:Apply here.Its going to be a hoot!Each week, TechCrunch Radio will air Tuesdays at 6:00 pm ET with a replay at 6:00 pm PT, drive time for both coasts, on Indie, channel 102, and through the SiriusXM Internet Radio App on smartphones and other connected devices, as well as online at siriusxm.com.
