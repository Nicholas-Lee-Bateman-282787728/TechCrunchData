Winter is slowly turning to spring here in New York City, which makes our trip up to the Sirius XM studios each Tuesday far more attractive. So naturally, were more excited than ever to catch up with you fine entrepreneurs in next weeks episode of TechCrunch Radio.As per usual, well start out the show by talking about the latest in tech and startup news, and then transition into our weekly TC Radio Pitch-Off, where five companies will have exactly 60 seconds to pitch their product live to a panel of judges, including John Biggs, myself, and an expert VC.Well take a couple of minutes after each pitch to ask questions and get our thoughts sorted, and at the end of the show well announce our winner live.Its always a good time, but it doesnt work without the participation of brilliant entrepreneurs. Which is my way of passive-aggressively asking you to apply to be a part of our pitch-off. Or just listen to the show. Whatever works for you.Here are all the deets:Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome.
3. You must be able to pitch your product with your words only.
4. You must be able to operate a telephone.Apply:Apply here.Its going to be a hoot!Each week, TechCrunch Radio will air Tuesdays at 6:00 pm ET with a replay at 6:00 pm PT, drive time for both coasts, on Insight, channel 121, and through the SiriusXM Internet Radio App on smartphones and other connected devices, as well as online at siriusxm.com.
