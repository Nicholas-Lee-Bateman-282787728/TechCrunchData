AHHHHHHHH.I feel like Ive been waiting years for this. The first real footage of  Star Wars Battlefront   an EA-made sequel to the wonderful first person shooter of the same name that LucasArts (RIP) made back in 2004  just dropped at E3.Unlike previously released footage (which was made with the games engine but all pre-rendered) this clip is said to be ripped straight from actual gameplay running on a PS4.Im perhaps more excited about this than I am about The Force Awakens. Okay, probably not  but its close.For anyone who never played it, Battlefront is what happens when you take the Star Wars universe and smash it into a first person shooter with epic, 40-person multiplayer battles.Hoth! Flyable TIE fighters versus flyable X-Wings! AT-ATs versus snowspeeders! Lasers! THE LAAASEEEERS.Fans have been begging for a new Battlefront game for over a decade now  but, despite a number of attempts, LucasArts just couldnt get one out the door. After LucasArts got shuttered by Disney back in 2013, EA DICE  creators of the popular Battlefield series and the Frostbite game engine that powers most of them  got their hands on the license and ran with it.Ive been burned by putting my faith in EA once or twice before  Ive come to more or less expect their wares to have game-breaking bugs on launch day. But with a brand like Star Wars at play (under the watch of Disney, no less), we can assume/hope that the good enough bar is set sky high.The new Battlefront will ship November 17th, 2015. I cant friggin wait.
