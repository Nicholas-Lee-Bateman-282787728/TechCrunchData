Kapor Capital wants its portfolio companies to progress in the areas of diversity and inclusion, which is why its launchingtheFounders Commitment, a four-part roadmap for startups to foster diverse and inclusive cultures early on.Baking diversity and inclusion into a companys culture early can provide the foundation to build a much more representative workforce in later stages of growth, Kapor Capital Partner Freada Kapor Klein said in a statement. We look forward to the day when one of these diverse startups takes off to become the next tech giant.The commitment will be a standard term in all of Kapor Capitals new investment agreements, but existing companies in Kapor Capitals portfolio are able to opt-in to the pledge.Heres what the companies have to commit to:The goal is to make the tech industry look more like the world we live in  a diverse one. Kapor Capital also recognizes that diversity can lead to better ideas, new revenue streams and bigger profits. In fact, ethnically diverse companies are 35% more likely to financially outperform those that are not, according to research firmMcKinsey.The idea forthe Founders Commitmentcame from Kapor Capitals portfolio companies last summer, and the firm hopes that it will inspire similarinitiatives in Silicon Valley and in tech as a whole. If other VC firms follow suit by requiring this fromtheir new portfolio startups, the overall impact on diversity and inclusion could be huge.So far,52 companiesin Kapor Capitals portfoliohave signed on to the pledge. That includes companies like Jopwell, PreK12Plaza, Honor, Birdi, Clever and Bitly.By building a diverse workforce, we are not only doing the right thing, but were doing the right thing for our business, Bitly VP of Human Resources Susan Riskin said in a statement. We truly believe that Kapor Capital Founders Commitment will raise awareness across the tech industry and will provide a path for underrepresented entrepreneurs to succeed and create technologies that are useful to all populations.
