VCs have been watching with great interest as mutual funds mark down the value of some of their privately held, illiquid investments, including shares of Dropbox, Zenefits, and Snapchat. Turns out the SEC is watching, too. A new Wall Street Journal report says the agency has been asking more questions of large fund firms about how they value startups and whether their process ensures an accurate estimate of a companys worth.According to the WSJ, examiners from the agencys enforcement division are not yet involved in the inquiries. And asked yesterday if the SEC is investigating mutual funds pricing of private companies, a spokeswoman responded to us this morning, saying the agency isnt commenting on its plans.But some think its only a matter of time before a full-fledged investigation is launched into possible violations of federal securities laws, given the difference in prices that some funds have assigned their holdings, how theyve timed their markdowns, and the opaqueness around both. The whole matter may give pause to other investors whove been looking to access the private markets, too.Lowering PricesMuch of the recent handwringing over markdowns ties specifically to Fidelity, the mutual fund giant that  as Fortune reported last week  recently slashed the valuations of a surprising number of its illiquid holdings in high-flying companies that include Zenefits, Snapchat, and Dropbox.Based on Fortunes review of Fidelitys holdings, Fidelity marked down Snapchats valuation by roughly 25 percent between the end of July and the end of Septemberbased on an investment it had made just this past spring. Fidelity also marked down its investment in Blue Bottle Coffee by 43.4 percent as of late September just five months after Fidelity had invested in the company.The markdowns seemed to catch the venture community by surprise, partly because of their breathtaking scopebut also because venture capitalists tend to hold their investments at cost. What that means: They tend to value companies at what they paid for them, unless urged by their auditors to mark up deals based on outside data points like the acquisition of a company in a similar space, or what other investorshave decided aparticular portfolio company is worth.Put another way, the same company can be valued very differently by its backers, who neednt move in lockstep. Fidelitys numbers are an interesting data point but they have no bearing on how we might think about valuations, says one VC from a top five venture firm who asked not to be identified for the story. Everyone looks at market conditions and performance, but everyone has different policies regarding how to get to the right valuation.Its not that different than one analyst of a public stock issuing a buy rating, two issuing a hold rating, and five issuing a sell rating, adds a third-partyvaluation expert who also askednot to be named in this story.Worth noting: Valuations dont tend to differ all that much in the early stages of a companys life. Smaller companies with smaller boards typically [peg a companys valuation] at a similar [number], says Bob Raynard, the managing director of thefund administration services company Standish Management in San Francisco.Its when investors invest in later-stage companies with much bigger cap tables and more investors that thing change, says Raynard. Then you have different people with different objectives, and some are much more aggressive when it comes to valuations.Another Shoe to Drop?Which brings us back to Fidelity. One of its markdowns involves Blue Bottle Coffee. As it happens,Fidelity marked down its investment in the company nearly three months after Blue Bottle decided to shut down its wholesale business.That decisionmight or might not have factored into Fidelitys decision to value the company differently. (The firm doesnt publicly discuss its valuation methodologies.)But if it did,thats notable, suggests Raynard. Though a mutual fund cant exactly re-evaluate its private companies value daily as it does with its liquid holdings, Fidelity may have let the lofty valuations it had set for certain private companies grow stale, suggests Raynard, meaning newer shareholders in Fidelitys mutual funds may have overpaid for those assets.Its a very real issue, says Jacob Frenkel, a former senior counsel in the SECs Division of Enforcement who today works at a white shoe law firm in Potomac, Md. Where you have inconsistencies and disparities in valuation process and the perception of staleness in pricing, those are the types of issue that the SEC would examine. Its certainly would be of interest to them.Stale prices are considered a red flag for a flawed valuation process, Frenkelsays.Theres much that we still dont know, of course. For example, as Frenkel notes, itsalmost certainthatFidelity regularly prepares whats called a stale price report that lists those of its securities whose price hasnt changed for a defined period, and Fidelitysurely hasextensive procedures to determine when and whether those assigned prices are still valid.The big question for investors like Fidelity, for the SEC, and for other mutual funds that may be interested in getting more involved in privately held companies  is whether those procedures are sufficientlyeffective and, if not, where they are failing the individual investors who park some of their savings in mutual funds.Raynard, who was formerly a senior manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers, suggests its something the SEC might have taken an interest in even sooner. I used to audit mutual funds [at PWC] and I dont think the mutual fund boards have a good process.In their race to compete with index funds and [asset managers like] BlackRock, its very possible that certain mutual fund companies have been subjecting mom and pop investors to risks that they shouldnt, he adds.
