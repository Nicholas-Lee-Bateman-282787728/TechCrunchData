GoPro today announced the acquisition of two startups to address one of the companys sore spots: Video editing. Stupeflix and Vemory are the companies behind the mobile apps Replay and Splice, respectively. GoPro tells TechCrunch the company spent $105 million on the two companies combined and that all the employees from these companies will join GoPros ranks but work from their current locations of Paris and Austin, Texas.The two apps should bring new tricks to GoPros mobile offering. Replay, by Stupeflix, lets uses select video clips and combine them into a single film complete with transitions and music  clearly something GoPro users would want. Splice, from Vemory, is a more robust mobile video application that provides a lot of tools not found in GoPros mobile editing app.Most GoPro users can agree, its a pain to edit and share captured content from GoPros own mobile app. Its desktop app isnt that much better, either. The company thrives at building hardware and developing a brand, but its clearly not great at building software  and with that the complete user experience thats needed in todays ecosystem. So $474 million cash in the bank, the company went out and spent a chunk of its cash and equity two companies that can hopefully fix the problem.
