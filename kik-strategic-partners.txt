Kik, the mobile messaging app company based in Waterloo, Canada,is assessing opportunities to advance itsservice throughpartnerships and strategic investment with established tech firms. Contrary to media reports, however, it is not shopping around for a sale.Bloomberg today reported that Kik, which developed a mobile messaging app with over 200 million registered users,is exploring a sale and/or new financing after contracting in Qatalyst. That comes just weeks after Facebook turned its Messenger service into a platform, and against a backdrop of news that has raised the profile of messaging over the past year includingFacebooks $19 billion acquisition of WhatsAppand rise ofSnapchat, which was valued at$15 billion following a recent investment from Alibaba.Reports that Kik is pursuing a sale make sense within that context  except that the company isnt.TechCrunch understands from a source within Kik that, while the company has hiredQatalyst, it did soto expand its network of contacts inside the tech industry with a view to future fundraising opportunities, partnerships and other benefits.As our source put it: it can be hard to build a tech company all the way up in Canada,Qatalyst is the first bank which Kik hasliked and it has alreadyhelped open doors.Kik provided TechCrunch with a statement that explained that, after getting a lot of approaches, it is now talking to pretty much every company to see what a partnership might look like[but remains] absolutely committed to staying independent.That might sound like an oxymoron, but we understand that Kik is seekingstrategic investments that can bring value to itsplatform, for example integrating another company or service into its chat messenger.Since it is talking to a range of companies, some potential partners might not be well suited for investments perhaps due to their scale or demands  andan acquisition might sit better.In those circumstances, Kik isreluctant to do a deal but is having discussions because it is keen to scope out all opportunities available.Stepping back for a second and looking at the company, an exit doesnt make sense for Kik at this time either.The platformization of Facebook Messenger validated the concept of mobile messagingthat thecompany hasworked onsince 2009. Kik CEO Ted Livingston has spoken on numerous occasions about his belief that Kik can grow into a The Next Internet, ora U.S. version of hit Chinese chat app WeChat, whileothers in the industry are beginning to see the potential of messaging as a platform for services in the U.S., it is still early days and there is vast potential to grow.Kiks revenue generationis also still embryonic.It finally began monetizing late last year, when it introduced branded accounts and advertising, and it has plans to adda payments service this year and, in time,other types of commerce-related services.Added to that, Kik doesnt have a pressing need to exit. Bloomberg reports that it has two years of runaway left.Ithas kept expenditure modest  being in Canada has no doubt helped  and has raised a total of $70 million, including its most recent $38.3 million Series C round in November.Its clear from talking to Livingston over the past couple ofyears that his vision of where the messaging market is heading is coming alive now. If heand his teamwant an exit,it could be far more lucrative in a few years if Kikcan execute on its plan.Of course, WhatsApps founders are equally as evangelistic about messaging, yet they sold to Facebookand retained their independence too.So it can be done, though opportunities like Facebook are rare and the company has made its move in messaging already.
