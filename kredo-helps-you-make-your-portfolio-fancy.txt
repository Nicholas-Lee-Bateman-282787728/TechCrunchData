You may be fancy and everybody already knows this, but does your portfolio reflect that? Kredo, a new portfolio app, will help you and those around you find out just how fancy you are.Created by Lukas Dryja and Tyler Rooney, Kredo was built after the pair realized their artist friends had no online portfolios. A good, custom website cost money so they decided to bootstrap a cheap solution. It is an easy-to-use iPad app that lets you upload and share portfolio items right on your mobile device.The product is funded by the Canada Media Fund to the tune of about $600,000. It was part of the CMFs Experimental Stream of juried projects and is gaining traction. It is available for free today on the App Store.Creative professionals want to be able to control the quality of the work they are presenting. The iPad is the perfect technology to do just that. A portfolio review is an important step in landing a great job, and with the iPad app, creatives can be assured that the image will look identical on another current iPad. Plus, its mobile  you can take and edit your portfolio anywhere, even without an internet connection, said Dryja.The app can be used in one-on-one interviews or in presentations. Its a sort of one-stop-shop for your entire portfolio and is surprisingly usable. You can also share your portfolio publicly or privately.Our users were frustrated with the current offering and needed a product that would allow them to replace their traditional portfolio with something they can update quickly and not sacrifice the image quality of the works they need to present on a daily basis, said Dryja.The app launches today and is available for download now.
