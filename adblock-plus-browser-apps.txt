Popular desktop ad-blocking software Adblock Plus, which has some 50 million+ monthly active users worldwide,has finally launched an iOS app. Its also managed to convince Google to allow its ad-blocking browser for Android back in the Play Store, noting that this is the first time since March 2013 its been allowed inthe Google-controlledAndroidapp store.Speaking to TechCrunch back in July, ABPs head of ops, Ben Williams, said the company was planning to launch an Adblock Plus browser for iOS in early fall/late summer. So theyre spot on in their timing.Clearly the company waseager to get its app live before the widespread availability of iOS 9  which introducesa content blocking feature to the platformthat will enable developers to more easilycreatead blockers and other content blockers for the platform, spawning more competition for Adblock Plus. (But arguably also raising mobile users awareness about ad-blockers as a general category  ABP dubsthe move a big step for this industry in a statement today.)While ABP has built a successful business on the desktop, the switch to mobile computing is more of an implementation challenge. In the case of its approach with these browser apps, its having to rely on users downloading and using a dedicated browser for ad-blocking  rather than being able to workas an extension on the native browsers(a route thats blocked to it for now).APBs Android browser app has been in beta since May, and it says more than 300,000 people have downloaded it since then to kick the tyres. Having the app in the Play Store will of course enhanceits visibility and discoverability.(ABP has previously describedits software as practically invisible to the vast majority of mobile usersthanks tobeing ejected from Googles app playground.)Itsan interesting shift on Googles part  but likely Mountain Views hand is being forced here by Apples own move to clear a path for iOSusersto more easily choose what types of content they do and dont want to see by giving developers a web content blocking tool.The wider point here is that mobile data can be costly, so sites larded with ads arenot only annoying users by slowing down page loads times, but may also actively be costing them money by gobbling uptheir data allowance. Not to mention the other big issue here: hugelyinvasive tracking and ad-targeting technologies that are being increasingly deployed by advertisers.Adblock Plus is very excited and grateful to have our app, Adblock Browser for Android, available in the Google Play Store, notedTill Faida, co-founder of Adblock Plus, in a statement, without elaborating on exactly how that feat was achieved.ABP claimsits Android and iOS browsers offer safer, more private, faster and more efficient browsing. It also toutsreduced battery drain as an added benefit of blocking ads while browsing, along with claims ofa reduced risk of malware infection.But what about online publishers business models if everyone starts blocking ads? ABP notes thatits browsers let users supportwebsites by whitelisting them (and thus their ads). Sopublishers can appeal to their users to whitelist their ads, and/or improve the quality of their ads to make themless irritating.Other controls offered to users of the ABP browsers include the ability to add additional filter lists, to customizethe content thats blocked, and change the default setting to block all ads  i.e. opting out of ABPs own whitelisted ads (which it calls acceptable ads).On iOS the companyis also touting an intuitive tab functionality (vs Safaris accordion style) and easier bookmarking, as well asclaiming scrolling is smoother. Plus itstweaked the keyboard layout with an eye on browsing convenience, such as putting a .com button inpride of place.A quick roadtest of the browser on iOS appears to confirm smallspeed enhancements when loading websites via the ABP browser vs standard Safari (and of course no annoying pop-ups), however the app also crashed during this testso it looks like there area few teething stability issues for ABP to iron out.
