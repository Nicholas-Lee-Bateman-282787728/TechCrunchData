During the Abaco Holdings portion of its earnings call, Yahoo briefly traded higher than its end-of-day price. The company initially fell a few points after reporting a profit, and revenue miss during its third quarter.That was initially tempered by quietly announced news in its release that Google is now a search partnerfor Yahoo. The Yahoo-Microsoft deal has long been financially rocky. That fact, coupled withMayers prior tenure at Google itself make the new partnership roughly as surprising as a sunrise.The executives fielded a number of questions concerning the Abaco Holdings spin out. The inquiries mostly focused on the potential tax implicationsof the deal, which remains in some doubt. Which company would pay any potential tax bill was surfaced, for example.
