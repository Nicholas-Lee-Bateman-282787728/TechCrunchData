Messaging app Tango has made further layoffs as new CEO Eric Setton continues to orchestratechanges in a bid to transform the struggling companys fortunes.Setton, who moved from CTO to CEO last month, split the Tango app into two  a back-to-basics messaging service and a social networking app  earlier this month. On Friday,he announced that 20 percent of Tangos team would exit the company as part of a new phase for the U.S. company, which was values at over $1 billion following a $280 million Series D led by Alibaba in March 2014.Today were taking additional steps to set up Tango for long-term success by making the tough, but necessary decision to restructure the team. A recent review of our operations and finances made it clear to me that we need to align better our expenses with our revenue, Setton said in a statement.This restructuring is in line with planned layoffs that we reported on in January, but with one change. Tango was initially planning to shutter its office in Beijing, China, but instead it made these latest reductions from its HQ in Mountain View, includingstaff working on its mobile games division. Forbes reported that 50 of Tangos 250 staff will exit, but one source told TechCrunch that the number is actually 70 andthere will be reductions from the China office, too, but not right now.The layoffs today were in Mountain View. I dont have anything to share about our other offices at this time, Setton told TechCrunch when we asked whether the Beijing office would be closed.We reported last November that Tango quietly let nearly 9 percent of its workforce go after it closed down its e-commerce service, which was launched in partnership with Walmart and Alibaba barely six months earlier.Tangos company culture reached a toxic crescendo last year that wasone factor that led to then CEO Uri Raz being replaced by Setton, alongside mismanagement and question marks around previous funding rounds  and theres concern that these layoffs could trigger problems again.A long-timeTechCrunch source inside Tango told us that, with Mondaya national holiday, many of the staff affected by the layoffs took a long holiday and werent present in the office to hear the announcementfirst-hand.In a company blog post, Setton acknowledged that Tango needs to be nimbleto take on its much larger rivals, and with the messaging industry now dominated by a handful of powerful players, he has his work cut out re-establishing Tango and its service, which enjoyed a meteoric rise when it burst on the scene as one of the first cross-platform video calling apps.Tango claims 350 million registered users, of which 48.5 million wereactive each month as of October 2015, according to internal documents reviewed by TechCrunch. Thats compared to one billion active WhatsApp users, 800 million active Facebook Messenger users, 650 million WeChat active users, 215 million active Line users, to name but a few competing apps. Theres also Apples iMessage and the humble SMS, which compete with all chat apps.Setton told Forbes that Tango still has half of the money from its Series D in the bank, so, with these new cost reductions, it seems like Tango isnt about to go out of business any time soon. Setton and his team will no doubt be back to the drawing board for new ideas to spur a turnaround.
