One of the startups incubated at startup studio Expa is today taking its next step in developing as a standalone company. Kit, a social network where people can share their favorite products  think Pinterest or Product Hunt, but here assembling your kits  is appointing its first CEO, Camille Hearst.Hearst has been with Expa and Kit since March 2015, after an impressive runat Google, Apple iTunes and transport app Hailo.Kit itself  which launched publicly in November 2015  was built on a concept and design from both Hearst and Naveen Selvadurai, one of the co-founders of Foursquare who is Expas New York-based partner. The move to add the CEO role and put Hearst into it is a signal that Kit is now fully operational, the company tells me.Other startups that have been conceived and incubated in Expa include Operator, Current and Spot.New Yorks startup landscapemay often becompared to that of Silicon Valley,but one of the big differentiators has been the role of the startup studio in New York, which not only helpsconceive and cultivateideas buthelps grow them into startups.Why do so many of themthrive in New York versus SF? Some think it has to do with the relative lack of maturity in the startup ecosystem, where the landscape is less diverse and a lot less populated than on the West Coast.Today at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York, leaders of three of these  Betaworks John Borthwick, Human Ventures Heather Hartnett and Expas Naveen Selvadurai sat down with Mike Butcher to chat about what they are doing differently when they turnideas into businesses.A lot of the products that we create at Betaworks, were co-founders in those products, noted Borthwick.We fashion ourselves builders and the studio lets us do that, addedSelvadurai.Manufacturing Serendipity in Startup Factories (full panel) #TCDisrupt https://t.co/v9lA6dzJc5 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) May 10, 2016Unsurprisingly, the studios think their way of doing things, and the smaller scale, makes for a more quality process. Things are getting funded that maybe shouldnt be, Hartnett noted about the state of affairs in Silicon Valley.
