Microsoft dropped an interesting piece of information today amid its confirmation that Windows 10 will go on sale this summer.Near the end of its announcement, the Redmond-based company casually revealed that it is testing Windows 10 with power users of Xiaomis flagship Mi 4Android smartphone. The initiative, which Xiaomi stressedis not a partnership but merely assistance with the trial, is an interesting one because itagain shows Microsofts new platform agnostic approach.Neither Microsoft nor Xiaomi provided specific details of the Windows 10 software being trialled,but TechCrunch understands from sourcesthat it effectively overrides Android, turning the Xiaomi phone into a Windows 10device complete withMicrosoft services. (Which the company hopes will dazzle Android owners into making the switch.)Thats to say that the software doesnt offera dual boot option, which Microsoft has pushedin the past in India. This is a ROM, based on Windows, that operates much like software from Cyanogen  a company Microsoft was incorrectlylinked with an investment in  and othercustom ROMsdeveloped by the likes of Tencent and Baidu in China.The ROM is thus designed to gobeyond Microsofts Android apps andoffer a native-like Windows experience on Android phones.Thats a pretty powerful concept, and it is no surprise to see Microsoft testing it in China, where consumers are more inclined to install ROMs. Theres a greater spirit of customization in China, particularly for Android userssincethird-party app stores are the norm asGoogle Play is severely restricted there.Microsoft, of course, has big plans to make this software available on more devices in time. The company told The Next Web that full availability will be announced soon (update: full statement below),but it is starting out with Xiaomi  almost certainly because ithas a strong community of users who provide feedback on the companys weekly software updates.Xiaomis receptive audience is ideal for such a pilot.A good idea though it may be, getting adoption foran Android ROM in China is no easy thing. Just ask Baidu, which recently shuttered its Android software efforts due to low interest thats despite the companys vast reach and distribution potential as Chinas Google.As for Xiaomi, people are often quick to rush to the idea that itis at odds with Google since it doesnt offer the U.S. companys services onits MIUI platform in China.Xiaomis emphatic comment that its involvement in Windows 10is not a partnership  coupled with Hugo Barras recent explanation that itis not pushing its suite of services to users outside of China suggests that this is not tactical; Xiaomi is just giving it users another ROM to tinker with.The news could be taken in a cynical way in the U.S.  where whats good for the users is often convenient because its good for the business too  but Xiaomi really has cultivated a sizable and trusted community, so were inclined to believe its rhetoric on this occasion.Update: Here are more details from Microsoft.Update 2: Microsoft has rewordedits original statement to keep things concise so weve switched the quote below. (Two things worth noting about its initial comment though:it confirmed Mi 4 owners canflash their phones with the new Windows 10 OS and that availability will be announced in the months to come.)Through a new program with Xiaomi Inc., one of the top smartphone distributors in the world, a select group of Xiaomi Mi 4 power users will be invited to help test Windows 10 and contribute to its future release later this year. They will have the opportunity to download the Windows 10 Technical Preview, install it and provide their feedback to Microsoft.
