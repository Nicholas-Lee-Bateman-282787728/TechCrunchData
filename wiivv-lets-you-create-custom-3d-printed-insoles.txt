After closing a $3.5M seed round last month, Wiivv is officially launching today at TechCrunchs CES Hardware Battlefield.The startups first product, BASE, is a custom, 3D-printed insole, that just launched for preorder on Kickstarter.BASE uses your smartphones camera to capture 5 photos of your feet, and turn those into a 3D printable model. And, before sending it off to be printed, users can customize their colors and even have their name engraved on the bottom of the orthotic.Of course custom orthotics are nothing new. But Wiivv hascombined a 2D-to-3D customization engine with an adaptive manufacturing system to seriously cut down the cost of custom insoles.BASE will retail for $75, hundreds of dollarsless than traditional prescribedorthotics that you would get from a podiatrists office.The company was founded by Shamil Hargovan and Louis-Victor Jadavji, both of whom came from jobs in the 3D printing industry, withHargovan coming fromHPs 3D printing division.While there are a few other startupsthat are 3D-printing custom orthotics, Wiivv is quick to note that their printing technology will eventually be used to custom build virtually anything for the body.As the company explains, their Adaptive Manufacturing System will allow them tomake any device for the human body customizable with disruptive levels of convenience and affordability for the end user.And though BASE is currently the only product the company is selling, the company promises to release their secondproduct once their campaign hits 5,000 backers.BASE can be preordered now on Kickstarter, and the company hopes to ship the soles to their earliest backers as soon as February.
