Yesterday U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron was dubbing a Fox News commenter who had made ludicrous claims on a topic on which he was entirelymis-informed clearly an idiot.Today Cameron has been brandeda dunceof similarproportions after making a speech calling forencryption to be banned on national security grounds.From #FoxNewsFacts to WebCameronClangers (or #CameronCryptoBollox as one tweeter put it)How long is a day in politics!The back story here, as Iwrote yesterday, is that European politicians have been calling for increasedsurveillance of online activity to combat terrorism,in the wake oflast weeks terror attacks in Paris. This is the usual trigger response of Western politicians strivingto look tough on terrorism.However the U.K. PM, who is notably on the re-election trail right now  with a General Election coming up in May  singled himselfoutfor the most hawkish pronouncements on this front, effectively calling for a ban on end-to-end encryption.Are we going to allow a means of communication between people which even in extremis, with a signed warrant from the Home Secretary personally, that we cannot read? said Cameron in a speech yesterday attacking encryption. No we must not. The first duty of any government is to keep our country and our people safe.So  presumably  Cameron is calling for a ban on mainstream messaging services which use encryption, such as Apples iMessage or FaceTime. Not to mention PGP. Hes likely also not comfortable with consumer services that deliberatelydelete messages after the intended recipient has viewed them, such as Snapchat unless they offerbackdoors toU.K. security services. And what about the entirebanking industry, which clearlyrelies on strong encryption to function? Is that going to be banned or not?Helpfully the EFF did a security reviewof messaging services last year. And gave gold stars toChatSecure, Cryptocat, Signal/Redphone, Silent Phone &Silent Text(pictured at the top of this post running on the security-focused BlackPhone smartphone) and TextSecure.Such strongly secured commsservices would presumably be first up against the wall in aCameron-led Tory Britain.The alternative is that Cameron isnot actually sostupid as to think its possible  or desirable  to erect a great encryption-banning firewall around the U.K. that somehow outlaws all sorts of essential technologies and sandboxes the countryfrom the rest of the connected world. (For some granular detail on what might be required to deliver aCameronencryption banread this excellent Boing Boingdebunking.)Rather he just thinks the British public is sostupid  sois making absurdclaims inthe hopes people vote for him. That, folks, is politics.Whatever the truth  whetherhes just blowing hot air and indulging ina spot of totalitarianposturing because he thinks being ablowhard will play well with voters in the wake of a terror attack, or whether he genuinelythinks he canoutlaw maths and that that would somehow be a good thinghappily theTwittersphere did not disappoint in its mockeryof hislatestdigital policy proposals.Heck, even Marc Andreessen calledCamerons plan lunacy.And the U.K.s Information Commissioner isnt exactly over the moon about the consumer services havoc the PM is proposing ushering in if he gets back into Number 10Information Commissioner: "In particular, I am concerned about any compromising of effective encryption for consumers of online services." Chris Williams (@cg_williams) January 13, 2015Far for me to suggest Cameronscomments have made him a laughing stock online  Ill let the below tweets speaking for themselves.(NB: Dave, theres noneed to ban encryption to read these unvarnished truths.)Politicians: The kind of people who think they can ban math.

InfoSec Taylor Swift (@SwiftOnSecurity) January 13, 2015Not that he's got a snowball in hell's chance of preventing end-to-end encryption, anyway. Dave's tech advisers are smoking the good stuff.
