App data and insights platform App Annie continues a shopping spree with the acquisition of AppScotch, an app marketing datacompany. Terms of the deal arent being announced, but theroughly 10 employees of AppScotch which launchedtwo years ago and raised roughly $1 million in seed funding from Eastern European angel investors  have already joined App Annie at its downtown San Francisco headquarters.The deal marks the third small startup that App Annie has brought into the fold. In 2014, it acquired a bootstrapped competitor, Distimo, for undisclosed terms. Last year, the company paid an undisclosed amount to buy the mobile measurement service Mobidia, which had raised just more than $16 million from investors.On a call last week, cofounder and CEO Bertrand Schmitt saidAppScotchs technology will be integrated into new products thatenhanceApp Annies paid-forintelligence offerings. With this, well be able to provide new metrics and more visibility into the advertising side, helping app developersbetter understand the efficiency of different marketing channels.In January, App Annie, which is oftenafirst stop for developers, investors, and journalists looking tobetter understand app rankings and trends, raised $63 million in Series E funding in mostly equity and debt, Schmitt told us at the time.The round was led by Greenspring Associates, with participation from earlier backers e.Ventures, Greycroft Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, and Sequoia Capital.The debt was provided to the company by Silicon Valley Bank.Last week, Schmitt said that in addition to buying AppScotch, the company is always taking an active look at whats happening,including because a lot of companies reach out to us on a regular basis to have us take a look at their business.But he added that App Annie isvery careful. Weve already acquired three companies in two years; we want to make sure of an extremely good match [before buying a fourth company].Schmitt also suggested not reading too much into the move, including plans for an IPO. Were definitely not looking at going public in 2016, and we were never looking at that, he said.
