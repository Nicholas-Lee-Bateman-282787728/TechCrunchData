The MLBs streaming arm, MLB Advanced Media, was founded in 2000 and has been streaming live video to the web longer than anyone. MLBAM got so good at live that its been tapped by HBO, Sony, ESPNand many others to handle their streaming efforts.Thats why were happy to announce that Bob Bowman, president of Business & Media for MLB, will be coming to Disrupt NY to talk about the streaming business with us. Bowman isthe first and only CEO ofMLBAM and has been with it since its inception.MLBAM currently employs 850 people withheadquarters in NY in the Chelsea Market neighborhood  and recently opened an office in San Francisco. In 2014 it streamed 400,000 hours of video consisting of over 390 petabytes of information. Over the next 30 days MLBAM is serving video for Sony, Turner, ESPN, Wrestlemania, HBOs Game of Thrones and, of course, baseballs opening day.Well be talking to Bowman  who got a nice promotion at the end of last year during the league chief shuffle  right as they come off of that record season, so it should be interesting to see how that worked out.Of course, MLB business, including the running of MLB.com, the At Bat apps for various platforms and streaming live baseball, is still a massive portion of what MLBAM does. So well be sure to talk some baseball as well.Additionally, well discuss MLBAMs spin-off opportunity, something that new league commissioner Rob Manfred has been openly talking about in recent months.
