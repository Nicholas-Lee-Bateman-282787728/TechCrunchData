Atlanta was one of the first cities in which we held a TechCrunch Meetup. Back then, we didnt have quite as much structure. It was called the Southeast Mini Meetup Tour. There was no pitch-off. No program. Back then, Matt looked like this:But, despite the odds, the fine folks of Atlanta pulled together to give us one of the best events weve ever had. We held it at SweetWater Brewery, with food trucks lining the parking lot and a folk band playing at an outdoor stage. The local radio showed up and did a show around the event, and startups set up tables around the edges to show off their stuff. Over 500 folks showed up. And even though it rained unexpectedly that night, forcing all of us to huddle together indoors, it was one of the greatest nights in TC Meetup history. This year, were coming back for our fourth meetup in the ATL, and were hoping to make it the best yet. Were counting on you guys to help make that happen once again, four years straight. Weve already got ten amazing companies who are participating in the pitch-off, listed below, and now its all about making time in your busy schedules and simply showing up. We want to hear from you, learn about what youre working on, and see what we can do to become a more involved part of your community, even if we cant stay forever. And beyond all the mushy gushy stuff, we want you to have a fun night with the tech community of Atlanta. There will be beer. There will be competition. And there will be blood. Just kidding.Here are the deets:The Atlanta Meetup and Pitch-Off is going down on Tuesday, February 24, at 6pm, at Prive (960 Spring St. NW)Tickets cost $10 and can be found here.Oh, and were headed to Boston in the latter half of the week (Thursday) for the Boston Meetup and Pitch-off, so if you want to learn more about that, head over here.
