Matt is huddled in Vail, Colorado. Why? To hang out with GoPro, as they throw stuff into pools and dogs chase after it. But more seriously, GoPro is reportedly unveiling a service that allows you to record something on your GoPro and instantly view/share it on the cloud. Big deal.Meanwhile, we discuss the Pebble Time (Darrell just finished his review), which Mr. Etherington highly recommends for the Android users out there.Then we move into the new Amazon Fire TV announcement, complete with streaming games.But thats not all. Even though Matt exits early, we go through a full WWDC preview via Darrell.We discuss all this and more on this weeks episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast featuring Jordan Crook,Darrell Etherington and Matt Burns.Editorial Note: Matt just bounces out about 20 minutes into this episode. Darrell and I continue to talk about Apple, with a focus on Spotify vs. iTunes Radio vs. Rdio vs. Beats Music. Were all over the place. Roll with it.We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific.
