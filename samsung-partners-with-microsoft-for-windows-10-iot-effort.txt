Samsung has made its name in mobile as the worlds biggest maker of Android devices. But it looks like it has different plans in mind when it comes to connected devices and the Internetof Things.Today, the company announced that it will be working with Microsoft to develop IoT devices based on Windows 10, where the companies will work together to develop products that will run on the platform, as well as integrate with other companies developing hardware and services on Microsofts OS.Samsung and Microsoft working together is not completely new: the two have already been working together for some 30 years on Windows devices, Myerson noted on stage today. But this latest development is new and underscores a couple of things.For one, Microsoft has not exactly been a winner in the last hugeinnovation in computing, smartphones: that honor has really gone to Googles Android and Apple, who dominate the smartphone space in terms of device penetration, financials and mindshare.On the other hand, weve heard a lot about tensions between Samsung and Google over Android and perhaps this news is one way of Samsung indicating that its ready to dance with others if the occasion calls for it.The news of the IoT partnershipmade public ata keynote at the CES show in Las Vegas from Samsungs president of its business solutions unit, WP Hong, who also outlinedSamsungs ambitions across all aspects of the IoT spectrum: as chip maker, device maker and service provider, part of the companys IoTivity strategy.But not, it seems, as a platform maker. This is where Microsoft comes into play.Platform is integral to Samsungs IoT strategy, said Terry Myerson, VP of Microsofts Windows devices.For now there doesnt appear to be a lot of details of what shape this partnership will take but it looks like it will be part of what looks like a bigger relationship with the two and Microsofts own ambition to develop more universal windows apps that work across different devices and with a single unified security system in place across them.Myerson took the opportunity of being on stage to highlight anewWindows 10-based tablet, theGalaxy TabPro S, also announced here at CES, and drawing a link between it and the IoT news.With Windows 10, both companies wanted to do something great together, and we showcased the new Samsung Galaxy TabPro S, along with our shared vision for future innovation together across the entire Internet of Things, Myerson noted in a Microsoft blog post about the new IoT deal.Interestingly, though, Myerson did not use his stage time to talk about Windows 10 IoT Core, Microsoftsslimmed-down version of Windows 10 specifically geared toward IoT devices. The reason for that could be that it is currently only available on non-Samsung devices like the Raspberry Pi 2, but today wouldve been a good day to talk a bit more about a joint effort involving Windows 10 IoT core. Instead, Myerson only talked about Windows 10 on the new TabPro S.That leaves us with the question how deep this cooperation really is. If its only about using Windows 10 on some devices and occasionally integratingthem with Cortana, its really not much of a partnership.We asked Microsoft for more details about the extent of this partnership and will update the post once we hear back.The IoT theme this morning follows on from yesterdays keynote from IBMs CEO Ginny Rometty, who also used her stage time to tout the companys development of its Watson artificial intelligence platform. As part of that, she alsohighlighted how its data platform will rely heavily on the growth of IoT, both to gather data points and also to help control devices and services in the connected world.
