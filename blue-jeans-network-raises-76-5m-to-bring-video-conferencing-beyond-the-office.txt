Blue Jeans Network, a company that provides cloud-based video conferencing services, has raised $76.5 million in its fifth round of financing.NEA led the Series E round, joined by Accel Partners, Battery Ventures, Glynn Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, and Quadrille Capital. Jeter Ventures, anew fund launched byMLB all-star Derek Jeter,also participated.WhenBlue Jeans launched in 2011, the entire videoconferencing market was sized at 200 million minutes per year, according to co-founder and CEO KrishRamakrishnan, because companiesrelied primarilyon audio-only conference calls.Today,Blue Jeans alone facilitatesover one billion minutes of video conferences each year for over 25 million users across 5,000 companies.For work-related conference calls, Blue Jeans provides a single platform for audio, video, and document sharing, and its compatible with nearly every majorhardware and software platform. So you can choose to dial in to that all-hands meeting fromanywhere, whether youre on the go with your iPhone, at home on your laptop, or usingthe existing hardware system in theconference room.If youre not that excited about video conferencing, take a minute toconsider how this techcould be useful outside of anoffice setting. Primetime, a service thatBlue Jeansrolled out earlier this year, represents the companys first attempt to extendreal-time video conferencing capabilities beyond the enterprise.With Primetime, any live-streamed eventor broadcast can become interactive. By making it possible to quickly switch from one-way streaming mode to two-way interactive mode, hostscan engage with remote viewers as if they were at the event, whether thats a college lecture, a celebrity talk show, or a tech conference.This is where Derek Jeter fits in. Earlier this year, Jeter launched The Players Tribune, a media outletthat lets athletes tell their own stories. Using Primetime, the site will be able to provide viewers the opportunity to interact face-to-face with celebrities or athletes during interviews thatwere previously broadcasted to a passive audience.Other early Primetime partners include the Sundance Film Festival, TED, and the Wharton School of Business.Think about companies like Uber, they started out as a taxi replacement service, and today theyre more like a transportation replacement, Ramakrishnan says. When we started out, we were solving a very big problem in the video conferencing market, and now were changing the way that people perceive video and communication.
