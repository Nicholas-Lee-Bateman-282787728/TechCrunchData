This follows Alibabas $215 million investment in Tangolast year. Rakuten recently snapped up Viber for $900 million with an eye towardsintegrating mobile commerce into the messaging app.Asian investors were the drivers of this trend for the simple reason that Asia isahead of America in harnessing mobile messagings true potential.Chinas WeChat,for example, generates over $1.1 billion in revenue by offering its 440 million usersan all-in-one approach, letting them pay their bills, hail taxis, and order productswith a text. Line, a Japanese messaging app with 200 million users, has rolled outLinePay, allowing its users to make mobile payments, order groceries, book taxis,and more.The Conversational Commerce trend is also being boosted by a number of newconcierge messaging services that employ a combination of human and artificialintelligence. Magic became the talk of the town by enabling users to send a text toorder food, send flowers, or get laundry detergent delivered within the hour.Other start-ups in the conversational commerce space include Scratch andBRANDiD, which provide curated shopping recommendations; and Native, whosepersonal travel assistant service allows you to book flights and hotels by sending atext. Path Talk was the first messaging app to allow users to message directly withbusinesses, making restaurant reservations as easy as sending an SMS.These innovations point us in an exciting direction, liberating us from the traditionallimitations of the mobile interface such as small screen sizes and unwieldyshopping cart forms. You no longer need to download and launch separate apps foreach on-demand service. Over time, the use of natural language processing willautomate these concierge services, while retaining a human-in-the-loop to ensureaccuracy and handle the long tail of requests that cannot be automated.The inevitable evolution of messaging apps like Facebook Messenger and SnapChatinto commerce platforms will change the way we think about mobile commerce. Itwont be long until youll be texting your food order to DoorDash, paying bills bySMS, or firing off a quick Facebook Message to send flowers to your loved one.Magic may not be able to be deliver on their promise of bringinga tiger to yourfront door, but its clear that mobile messaging is about to get a whole lot morepowerful.
