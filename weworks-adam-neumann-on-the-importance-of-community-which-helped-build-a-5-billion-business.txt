For example, as one of its many measures to see if its building a strong community in its spaces, WeWork putcameras in its buildings totrack whether people are using common areas, like conference rooms. Its community managers are also incentivized to solve problems quickly and facilitate meetings between community members.The one thingwe learned about community, you cant force community, he said on stage. [Everything]has been organic, weve given it five years, weve perfected how we throw events, those things that let our members communicate betweenthemselves. We have a group of community managers, and we bonus them based on how many connections they made that month, that year.Another example, Neumann said backstage, is that community managers deliver mail in person and will talk to members personally if they are having issues. Every employee at WeWork gets equity  even those community managers, Neumann said, which are increasingly a key part of the companys strategy to promote a strong community in its co-working spaces.Every WeWork building has its own online network that anyone can use to communicate. Its often a place where people organize events or seek advice from other companies. But the goal is to eventually make sure all those connections end up offline, rather than just on an online network.Alot of times they are comfortable connecting virtually, and becauseof that you need to foster [offline connections], he said. Once that happens thats a whole differentstory. When [Hurricane Sandy]hit, our members were helping each other, some people had power and some people didnt, that was the first time I saw our community really alive.Today, the company also said it was giving away a month free of WeWork commons, a $45 per-month subscription that gives people access to the benefits and common areas of the companys buildings  of which Neumann said there would be around 50 by the end of the year.WeWork is also aggressively looking at Germany as a new area for WeWork buildings, and that he wanted to add an extra 50 buildings next year.
