Two words: supply constraints.Shipping timeframes for theApple Watch, which went up for online pre-ordera few hours ago with the promise of in-store pick up or home delivery starting on April 24, have quickly slipped to June for some models as buyers snapped up the undisclosed numbers of units Apple had ready for them.There are a total of 38 different models of the Apple Watch up for pre-order today via Apples online stores in nine countries: Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.Even the most expensive Edition line of Apple Watches is listed as shipping in June on the Apple US and Apple UK webstores. Although its still possible to find some models that are listed as shipping within 4-6 weeks  mostly from the mid-level priced Watch range, rather than the cheaper Sport or premium Edition line:Various models on Apples Chinese web store are also listed with June shipping  withsome of the Edition models just sayingnot in stock.None of this tells us very much, given theres no way to quantify Apple Watchdemand without being able to put a concrete figure on Apple Watchsupply. And therein lies the rub.That thereis some demandis evident. How much there is will have to wait for an official sales missive from Apple to find out.But if you were hoping to get your hands on Apples expensive wristwear this spring, chances are youll now bewaiting til summer  unless you opt for a less popular model.Apple confirmed it was makinga smartwatch in a September 2014 event, saying the wearablewould be available early next year.
