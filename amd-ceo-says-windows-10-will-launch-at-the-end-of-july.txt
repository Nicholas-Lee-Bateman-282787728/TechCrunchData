Buried in the question-and-answer section of AMDs earnings call this past Friday was an interesting note on the release timing of Windows 10. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, Windows 10 should be released in late July.In response to a question regarding its channel inventory, Su said the following:What we also are factoring in is, you know, with the Windows 10 launch at the end of July, we are watching sort of the impact of that on the back-to-school season, and expect that it might have a bit of a delay to the normal back-to-school season inventory build-up.TechCrunch reached out to Microsoft for comment on the supposed release date.The company has yet to respond. Its worth noting, as GeekWire pointed out this morning, Microsoft has saidthat Windows 10 will be released this summer. Now we have a firmer release date to expect.Microsoft has been coy on a public, hard release date for Windows 10 as there is little upside in providing one. It likely doesnt drive demand to have a public final date set so far in advance, and having any such benchmark would create another trip point for the software company to miss. And if you miss what amounts to little more than a synthetic deadline, you dont gain much other than a news cycle that frets about what has gone wrong.Windows 10 is Microsofts attempt to build a single operating system that can function across all computing form factors, from embedded chips, to smartphones and tablets, all the way through to PCs and even larger screens.If Windows 10 fails to attract a large cadre of users quickly, it could miss its chance to attract developers, crippling its application store. To combat that, Microsoft is providing free upgrades to Windows 10 for Windows 7, 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 users.The end of July is about 102 days away. Thats just over three months. Can Microsoft pull it off?
