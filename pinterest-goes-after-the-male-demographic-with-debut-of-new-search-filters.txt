Pinterest this afternoon announced a change to its sites search settings, which will now introduce search results that are personalized to your interests, based on whether youre interested in products for men or for women. This setting is based on the gender you previously selected foryour account when signing up for the service, the company tells us.The change is likely meant to make thelargely female-favored site more popular among men. Today, 71 percent of the sites 72.5 million visitors in the U.S. were women, comScore data indicates, though the demographics are less skewed in emerging markets, the company has said previously.Men arePinterests fastest-growing demographic, the service reported in November, citing internaldata that pointed to one-third of all sign-ups now coming from men, and closer to a 50/50 split between genders in signups from outside the U.S.Now, Pinterest reveals that its U.S. male user base grew 73 percent year-over-year in 2014.Men on Pinterest are favoring searches related to categories like apparel, technology, travel, gardening, recipes, gadgets, design, luxury cars, tattoos, and camping, says the company.With the change, Pinterest is trying to maximize its usefulness to its male users. The company tells TechCrunch that the change is meant to basically serve as a filter that lets you quickly see the most relevant results so you dont need to dig through irrelevant Pins when searching for things likeshoes, sunglasses, workouts, hair, and tattoos, for example.The filter, like others that appear in Pinterests guided search feature, can be toggled on or off at will. In other words, its not meant to hide content from you, its more about allowing you to narrow down your search results. It can also be enabled when youre looking for gifts, for example, like if youre a woman researching mens watches for a birthday present.Says Pinterest, the larger goal with the change is to make its site more of a discovery engine that uses technology to better match people to the best results for them, and the change is about making that even faster than before.The newfiltering will be available on thousands of searches on the site going forward, including things like watches, health, fashion, and tattoos. The company had previously been testing this feature, apparently, as Pinterest notesithas already seen this change bring about a double-digit lift in engagement, similar to the new user experience that shows trending interests for each gender to choose from as they get started, were told.While the change may prove to increase the sites usefulness to Pinterestssought-aftermale demographic, its worth pointing out also that broadly painting items as being for men or for women bumps up against the effortssociety has made thus farto distance itself from abinary gender system. Other social networks, like Facebook, for example, have allowed users to select from dozens of gender options.However, this could be a technical challenge, especially for a site like Pinterest, which is focused on returning product results already marketed to men or women by their manufacturers.But in the long run, Pinterest may do better to work to improve its true personalization capabilities by learning what style of shoes or watch one prefers regardless of a gender-based label  rather than categorizing some items as being for one sex or another.Correction: Pinterest is largely female (women). The typo has been fixed.
