The robots mightone day rise up and take over, but a Mountain View startup called Knightscope has developed a fleet of crime-fighting machinery it hopes to keep us safe.Knightscopes K5 security bots resemble a mix between R2D2 and a Dalek from Doctor Who  and the system behind these bots isa bit Orwellian. The K5shave broadcasting and sophisticated monitoring capabilities to keep public spaces in check as they rove through open areas, halls and corridorsfor suspicious activity.The units upload what they see to a backend security network using 360-degree high-definition and low-light infrared cameras and abuilt-in microphone can be used to communicate with passersby. An audio event detection system can also pick up on activities like breaking glass and send an alert to the system as well.Malls and office buildings are also starting to employ the K5 units as security assistants. Knightscope couldnt name names, but tells TechCrunch the robots are being used at a number of tech companies and a mall in Silicon Valley at the moment.Co-founder Stacey Dean Stephens, a former law enforcement agent, came up with the idea to build a predictive network to prevent crime using robots. He and his co-founder William Li have raised close to $12 million in funding so far from Konica Minolta and others to build on the idea.While Knightscope doesnt think its robots willreplace mall cops or security guards in the near future, the company does see them as assistants to human security teams. The startup currently rents each five-foot, 300-pound K5 unit out for $6.25 per hour (or less than minimum wage).However, teenagers or others tempted to kick or push the robots over may be shocked to find the robots can talk back to them, capture their behavior on film and alert authorities behind the scenes as well.Take a look at the video at the top for the behind the scenes interview with Stephens and to get a better sense of what these robots are capable of.
