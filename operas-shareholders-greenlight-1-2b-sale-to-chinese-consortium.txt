Browser maker Operas proposed $1.2 billion acquisitionby a consortium of Chinese companies just took a major step towards completion after its shareholders voted in favor of the deal.Opera announced today that90.6 percent of the outstanding share capital and 90.9 percent of the votes in the company have approved the acquisition. Thats a preliminary result that the firm will confirm for sure soon, but, if the numberstays as it is or is higher, that will be enough toenable the sale to proceed. Approval from relevant authorities in Norway and China will be required further down the line.Todays approval isnotable because there have been murmurs of discontent about the proposed saletoGolden Brick, a group comprised of Qihoo 360, one of Chinas most visible (and controversial) Internet companies which recently went private in a $9.3 billion deal, listed games firm Kunlun, which owns a60 percent share in gay dating service Grindr, and investment firm Yonglian.Weeks after the proposed offer was announced, Opera CEOLars Boilesen and CTO Hkon Wium Lietold TechCrunch that decision to sell wasnt made by them.I have been working for Opera since 99, Hkon 98, Boilesen said. Hes No. 8; Im No. 16. Weve been with Opera for many years. We got listed on the Stockholm stock exchange in 2004. So basically, the shareholders  they decided to initiate this process. It was kind of their decision. It wasnt our decision.Thats hardly a ringing endorsement.The proposed deal hasnt stopped Opera from introducing a busy slate of product updates, including a built-in VPN for its desktop browser and mobile apps, and an ad-blocker, too.
