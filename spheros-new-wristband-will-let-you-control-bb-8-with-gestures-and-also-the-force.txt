Were giving every Star Wars fan the power of the Force, said Sphero CEO Paul Berberian.He stopped by the TechCrunch stage at the Consumer Electronics Show today to show off the companys Force Band, which will allow people to control the companys BB-8 robotic toy with gestures. When pressed on how it worked, Berberian first said that the Force works in mysterious ways, but he eventually offered a little more detail.Whats really happening is, were detecting all the motions in [the users] body and were syncing those motions up to the sensors inside BB-8  theyre completely aligned, he said.We also talked about how the robotics startup first started working with Disney to create a smartphone app-controlled toy based on BB-8 from the new Star Wars film. He wouldnt reveal how many BB-8s have been purchased, but he said Sphero sold well over 1 million robots across all its product lines in 2015  the emphasis is on over. And of course BB-8 was the top seller.
