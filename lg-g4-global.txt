LG revealed the G4, its newest flagship device, in April, and now the 5.5-inch screen device is rolling out for sale across the world.Already on sale in its native Korea first, of course, the G4 will land in Hong Kong, before coming toTurkey, Russia and Singapore. Thereafter, LG said the phone will hit most of Europe, North America, CIS, Southeast Asia, Middle East/Africa and South/Central America over the next month  although it didnt provide more specific timing for those releases.President and CEO of LG Mobile, Juno Cho, said in a statement that the G4 is unlike any other flagship mobile phone on the market today. While todays smartphones are becoming fairly commoditized in terms of features, theres plenty to be optimistic about with LGs latest offering.The screen uses newquantum display tech, which apparently makes for better color reproduction, theres a redesigned camera which now sports a larger sensor  a 16-megapixel rear camera and eight-megapixel front camera  anda 64-bit hexacore CPUSnapdragon 808 processor to power the show.Added to that, the G4 includes a hand-crafted leather back, and subtle curve for improved feel in the hand. On the software side,there are some nicetweaks for serial Androidowners  Googles productivity apps come pre-installed, Chrome is the default browser, and theres Chromecast support baked right in.All of that leaves just one more question: what price?The pricewill vary worldwide, LG said, but early reports suggest it will retail for around $600 without a contract, or near $200 as part ofa U.S. carrier deal.That comes in around the same price as Samsungs Galaxy S6, while the Galaxy S6 Edge is around $100 more expensive. These three are certainly the Android phones to watch this year, so far (considering Xiaomi continues to operate in Asia only)  however Apples larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+ are increasingly appealing to new audiences and have won the U.S. firmadditional marketshare, particularly in China and other parts of Asia.
