Perhaps you missed the excitement in amongst the deluge of gadget news that is the International Consumer Electronics Show, butback in January Chinese handset maker Huawei introduced this pair of strange specimens.The incredibly unsubtly named Elegant and Jewel are the companys shot at appealing directly to female smartwatch owners. That said, the wearablesarent too large a departure from the standard Huawei Watch, save for thinner watch straps and the titular shiny aesthetics.The Elegant (real name, I double and triple checked) features a rose-gold plated body (not unlike a certain new laptop) and the Jewel has a bunch of Swarovski Zirconia crystals running around its face.It complements outfits for any occasion, whether its an important business meeting or gala of the season, according to Huawei. Sadly, their availability just missed the Mets technology-themed Gala. Theres always next year, I guess.Beneath all of the heirloom-worthy flash is a standard Android Wear smartwatch  albeit one that costs $500 to $600, depending on your preference for zirconia. The watches are available now through Amazon, Best Buy, and other retail locations, just in time for Mothers Day.
