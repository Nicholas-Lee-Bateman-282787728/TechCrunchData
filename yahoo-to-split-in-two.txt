Yahoo has today confirmed rumorsit is scrappinga plan to spin off itsstake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba. Itsshares areup in pre-market trading on thenews.The Yahoo board had been reportedto be considering its options on this front this month. An earlier rumor of this plan caused Yahoo shares to spike 7 percent.CEO Marissa Mayersaid in June the company would move forward with the spinoff of its stake in e-commerce giant Alibaba, havingrevealed a plan to do this at the start of this year.However, in recent weeks there hasbeen uncertainty about whether or not a spin-off of the stake, worth some $32 billion, would be taxed  with investors fearing a high tax billand activist Yahoo shareholders threatening a fight.Today, after what the company said was careful review and consideration of how to best drive long-term value for shareholders, the Yahoo board has unanimously voted to suspend the plan to spin off theAlibaba stake.It said itwill instead work on the reverse option for separating the stake  which means its planning to transfer all of Yahoos assets and liabilities other than the Alibaba stake (i.e. itscoreInternet business) to a newly formed company, thereby creating two separate, publicly traded companies.The thinkingbeing this reverse spin-off route is less likely to spook investors and the markets with fears of Yahoo incurring a big tax bill.The bifurcation will still requirevarious third party consents  including shareholder approval and SEC filings and clearance. And even with all that, Yahoosaid itmay take more than a year for the transaction tobe completed.Commenting in a statement, Mayer reiterated her view that the ultimate separation of our Alibaba stake will be important to our continued business transformation pushing the perception thatits not the overallstrategy thats being rethought here, just the route to get there.In 2016, we will tighten our focus and prioritize investments to drive profitability and long-term growth. A separation from our Alibaba stake, via the reverse spin, will provide more transparency into the value of Yahoos business, she said.However, a Yahoo separated from itshigh-value Alibaba stake could be a target for acquisition, given how little worth is attached to the rest of the companys assets and business.According to the FT, several private equity firms and media/Internet advertising firms are interesting in looking at an acquisition of Yahoo. While on Monday telco Verizon* said the group would explore a possible acquisition ofthe company if it were up for sale.Without its core Internet businessYahoo would be a very different business: a company with a 15 per cent stake in another ecommerce giant, but no longer an activeweb player itself  unless Mayers planfor Yahoostransformation really is a much tighter focus. Somore a total reboot than a turnaround of a struggling,veteran webcompany.Mayerwas hiredfrom Google to be Yahoos CEO back inJuly 2012with the companysaying at the time that she would lead a renewed focus on product innovation to drive user experience and advertising revenue.Three years later the companys products still struggle to stand out and keep pace, especiallywithapp innovation in the mobile industry. While it faces continued stiff competition on thead revenue front from the likes of Google and Facebook, although Mayer did ink a new three-year search ad dealwith Google this fall.Commenting on Yahoos plans, Andrew Frank, research VP analyst at Gartner, told TechCrunch:I think theres still a possibility that Yahoos core business could continue to evolve independently into a successful diversified digital media company, but it seems clear there will be a lot of investor pressure if it takes this road.I take Marissa Mayer at her word when she says the separation will provide more transparency into the value of Yahoos business. Optimistically, this could give Yahoo more maneuverability in M&A activities beyond a fire sale scenario.Ive long held the view that Yahoo is better positioned as a media company than a technology innovator, and that success in media requires overseeing a portfolio of content brands. If Yahoo cant do this itself then it will be better off joining an organization that allows it to focus on delivering content and advertising and cultivating audiences.*Verizon is the parent company of TechCrunchs parent company, AOL.
