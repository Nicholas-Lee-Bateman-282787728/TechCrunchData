Have a free Google Lunch you dont take advantage of because youre eating only local blueberries this week? Does your company have a masseuse you dont use because youre touch-phobic? WellDeserved is for you.The app allows you to sell the things you get for free. Pass your health insurance on, temporarily, to someone with a compound fracture. Give someone else the free doughnuts your vendors sent you  for a price. Have your HandyCleanerOnDemand stop off at someone elses house before they stop at yours. In the assisted living community for the young that is San Francisco, no privilege is too small to sell!WellDeserved is actually the brainchild of Kasima Tharnpipitchai, Larisa Berger, and Margaux Poupard who launched it at Comedy Hack Day, an event that brings together comedians and programmers to build hilarious apps. Sadly, for a certain type of person, WellDeserved hits quite close to home and says a lot more about the culture that spawned it than SF as a locus of comedy. But who doesnt love some yucks! And, as an added bonus, you get to see VC heartthrob Dave McClure!You can buy privilege  a harassment-free walk or a dental cleaning  at the WellDeserved website now but sadly the service is still in beta. However, if you throw your business card and close relationship to Dani Zuckerberg around a little maybe you can get early access?
