We are back, friends, in San Francisco for the years biggest Disrupt conference.The hackathon is currently in full swing, swarming with nerds, cars, technology, a Surface Pro 3, what I counted to be 897 Macbook Airs, and, of course, tamales.My good friend and colleague Megan Rose Dickey and I hung about aboot the venue until midnight, shot a host of nerf guns, and then doodledabout the place interviewing the hacking crews. Happily this was, in my experience, the most diverse hackathon that we have hosted.TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015 kicks off tomorrow. Your humble servant, and the whole TC crew will be presentin full force. If you arent going to be there, you arent square. You are a dodecahedron.For now, enjoy the teams.
