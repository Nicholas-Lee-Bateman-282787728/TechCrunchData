DataGravity announced version 2.0 of its storage appliance today, which focuses on data security, particularly knowing what files you have and whos been accessing them.When DataGravity emerged last summer with a new concept of data aware storage, it announceda number of key features, butit found that customers were gravitating most around security at the point of storage, DataGravity CEO, Paula Long told TechCrunch.The company concentrated on four main areas in the original release including security and governance, quick restore, search and discover and (of course) storage.Unlike most storage tools,DataGravity is intelligent, meaning it understands what its storing, and that customers can get insight about whatslurking inside their hard drives. Everyone found something in their data that they wish they hadnt, she said.That could include personal information like credit cards or social security numbers or people copying files they shouldnt have. In onecase, a lawyer copied all of his files to an external drivebefore leaving the company, which resulted in the firm suing him. We were amused by that, suingsomeone who is already a lawyer, she joked.The update enables administrators to subscribe to alerts, so they can be proactive about activity going on inside their storage appliance instead of explicitly having to go to the appliance to learn about security risks. They can receive an email or register the information in a system log, where the informationcould tie into a toollike Splunkor other logging tool.It also includes role-based file access to limit who can viewsensitive files, tagging to enable administrators to tag files withroles associatedwith them, the ability to create governance profiles that enable administrators to schedule compliance checks and a special plug-in for VMware to give companies insight into storage inside virtual machines created with VMware.Long wouldnt identify exactly how many customers the company has at this point, butshe didsay that itwasmore than 20 and less than 100.For now, the company is focusing onsmall to medium sized business (SMBs)with between 50 and 2,000 employees. Early customers include higher education, law firms, accounting firms and state and local governments. She hasnt ruled out larger enterprise customers, but she says thats down the road at this pointWe provide storage and add to that the ability to understand the storage and visualize it. We probably wont find our way to data centers at the high end for a few years, she explained.DataGravity has raised $92 million with the most recent, $50 million coming last December.Iinterviewed Long at TechCrunch Disrupt New Yorklast springwhere she talked about starting DataGravity and the sale of her previous company EqualLogic to Dell for $1.4 billion in November, 2007.
