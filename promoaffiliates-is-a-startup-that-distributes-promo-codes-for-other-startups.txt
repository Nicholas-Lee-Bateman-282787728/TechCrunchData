Getting users to sign up for your startup is really hard. Thats why young companies often create promo codes to entice users to recruit friends in return forfree cash or credits.While weve all heard stories ofthat one personracking up thousands of dollars in referral credits forstartups like Uber and Lyft, there havent been many businesses focused on generating revenue solelyby sharing other startups promo codes.Meet PromoAffiliates, a company that runs in-person and online marketing campaigns for startuplike Postmates, Lyft, and a tonof other on-demand startups. The LA-based company has acquired over 100,000 users for Uber and Lyft, with over 30,000 users for Lyft in one month alone.The company started when founder and CEO Aaron Leupp was trying to transport people to a nightlifeevent he was promoting for. He gave guests his personal Uber promo code, and soon realized that he could make more money promoting for startups thanfor bars and clubs.After a few months of using his personal referral codes to sign up users, Leupp decided to reach out directly tothe startups, asking ifthey would pay himin cash instead of credits. The rest is history, and today PromoAffiliates has used its network of a few thousand recruiters (whomit takes a ~20 percent cut from) to sendhundreds of thousands of users to over dozens ofdifferent startups.Interestingly, the companyworks with startups to adjust promotional bonuses in times of severe demand/supply imbalance. For example, Lyft recently offered Leupps company a 48 hour window during which they would pay $1000 for every new driver referral, with the new driver also receiving $1000.When asked what Leupp thinks about the stigma traditionally associated with sharing promo codes, he admitted that while some look down on the act, at the end of the day everyone is happy  the startup gets a new user, the user gets a great first-time promo code, and Leupp and his recruiters get paid.
