According to a Forbes report published last night, billionaire investor Peter Thiel has been quietly funding the casethat Hulk Hogan (whose real name isTerry Bollea) has brought against the online news organization Gawker.Bollea has won for now.AFlorida jury awarded Bollea $140 million in March over a sex tape that Gawker published in 2012. And today, Judge Pamela Campbell denied a motion byGawker thatcalled for a retrial, as well as denied a motion to reduce the penalties awarded by thejury.Still, asABC News notes, now that Gawkers motions to strike have failed, the companycan continue with the appeals process. (First Amendment specialists think its possible Gawker will win or else see Bolleas reward reduced.)The race to out Thiel seemed to begin earlier in the day yesterday, when theNew York Times quotedGawker founder Nick Denton as saying he believed Bolleas case was being bankrolled by someone in Silicon Valley. Dentonexplained that Bolleaslawyerhad removed a claim that wouldhave caused Gawkers insurance company to cover Gawkers legal costs andpayout in the event of a loss; theimplication was thatmoney wasnt the only or primary factor in Bolleas suit.Denton didnt hint at Thiel in the text of the piece, but the Times seems to have confirmed Forbess account subsequently.Assuming Thiel has been paying Bolleas attorney (Thiel hasnt responded to our request for comment), it is news that shoulddisturb everyone, writesJosh Marshall of Talking Points Memo. [B]eing able to give massive political contributions actually pales in comparison to the impact of being able to destroy a publication you dont like by combining the machinery of the courts with anonymity and unlimited funds to bleed a publication dry.The chilling effects are obvious,though its not exactly news that theentire legal system is up for sale. Even Denton, speaking to the Times before Thiels involvement was discovered, noted that: If youre a billionaire and you dont like the coverage of you, and you dont particularly want to embroil yourself any further in a public scandal, its a pretty smart, rational thing to fund other legal cases.And, no matter what the moral and strategic implications of this kind of thing, its still legal.Indeed, ifThiel wanted to attack Gawker, its hard to conjureup as cleveraway to get revenge on the outlet, whosenow-shuttered gossip site Valleywag regularly published posts about Thiel during its heyday nearly a decade ago.This reporter spoke with Thiel numerous times about how he was portrayed by Valleywags then-editor, Owen Thomas, a sharp journalist who didnt miss an opportunity to offer his takeon Thiels essays, ties to other organizations, tax strategies, and sexual orientation.As Thieltold me of the attention back in 2009, I actually think its sort of the psychology of a terrorist, where its purely destructive and that Valleywag is the Silicon Valley equivalent of Al Qaeda . . . Its terrible for the Valley, which is supposed to be about people who are willing to think out loud and be different. I think they should be described as terrorists, not as writers or reporters. I dont understand the psychology of people who would kill themselves and blow up buildings, and I dont understand people who would spend their lives being angry; it just seems unhealthy.Gawker was far from alone in its interest in Thiel, a PayPal cofounder and Facebooks earliest investor, whose public profilehas risen over the years alongwith his bank balance.In 2010, for example, Slate wrote a highly negative piece about Thiel, calling hisbelief system rooted in unapologetic selfishness and economic Darwinism. Thiel and I discussed it afterward, andI remember him being very measured in his response.Itwouldnt surprise meto think that these pieces had a lingering impact on him, though, and thathewanted to correct what he felt was an injustice.Photo: Getty Images
