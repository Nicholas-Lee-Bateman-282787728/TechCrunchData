Payments company PayPal is inching closer to spinning off from its marketplace parent eBay. Today its designated CEO, Dan Schulman,announced that it plans to list on Nasdaq and use PYPL as its ticker  theoriginal ticker it used before eBay acquired it in 2002.The company plans to spin off eBay in the second half of this year. To date, some 18 billion transactionsand over$1 trillion in payments have passed through its platform, and it now has 165 million consumers in 200 countries.While PayPal blazed a trail for online payments when it first launched in 1998, today thecompany faces a lot of competition, from traditional payment providers like banks and credit companies through to other large new entrants like Apple and newer startups like Stripe. Unsurprisingly, Schulman is therefore highlighting his companys legacy in the space.This is a meaningful symbol for the company because it represents our unbroken commitment to the spirit of the original vision that the sparked the launch of PayPal 17 years ago, he writes.Ithad already been carving out a position for itself as a payments provider outside of eBay, touching both online merchants and others who need to take payments as well as consumers and businesses that need to make payments, but its current owner still accounts for a very large portion of the business that passes through PayPal (and will continue to do so even after the spinoff).
