Xiaomi teased its new smart TV earlier this week. Rather than thethird-generationproduct many expected, it todayunveiled a smaller and cheaper version of its (already reasonably priced) Mi TV 2.The new Mi TV 2  which confusingly has the same name as its predecessor  is smaller at 40 inches wide and 14.5mm thick thin. For reference,last years modelis 49 inches and15.5mm. A quad-core MStar 6A908 Cortex-A9 CPU and Mali0450 MP4 GPU are under the hood this time, alongside 1.5 GB of RAM and 8GBmemory.The bigdifference here is that the new model has a1080p display, as opposed to last years 4K screen. Given that step down,the new Mi TV 2 comes in at a cheaper $322 (RMB1,999). Those preferring a higher resolution can pay $670 for the original, 49-inch Mi TV 2.Xiaomi has againintegrated an Android (well, MIUI)-based entertainment system. It runs Android 4.4 out of the box, but is upgradable to Android 5.0, the company said. Thats useful for playing games, watching videos and movies(Xiaomi reminded us it is investing $1 billion on content), and getting on to the web.The TV goes on sale in Chinaon March 31.
