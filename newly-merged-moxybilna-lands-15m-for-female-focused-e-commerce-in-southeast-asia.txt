Moxy and Bilna, the two female-focused e-commerce sites in Southeast Asia which merged last month, now have a new name and $15 million in funding to build out their game.The company, which has close to 400 employees, is now known as Orami, and today it announced that it has closed $15 million led by IndonesiasSMDV, and with participation fromGobi Partners, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, ArdentCapital and Saverins firm Velos Partners.The deal propels the companyforward in a major way, as itbattles to become the go-to destination for women shopping online in Indonesia, a country of over 250 million people, and the wider Southeast Asia region, which has a cumulative population of 620 million.Orami CEOJrmy Fichet and CMOShannon Kalayanamitr told TechCrunch that their website sees around three million visits per month, with three-quarters of its customers women. They claim that, on peak days, the service does 12,000 orders and that the average basket size is 25 percent higher than the average for e-commerce in Southeast Asia.Theres plenty of competition for online sales in Indonesia, with Rocket Internet-backed Lazada, which has raised hundreds of millions, and Matarhari Mall, a service from offline retail giant Lippo, among the larger fish.Kalayanamitr, though, believes that Orami is the only one that is focused on serving women in the country.Idont think we have direct competition, but [there are other players] in some verticals. We are really the only one doing it across the board, she said, suggesting that fast-growing Matarhari could be the biggestrival to Orami.Arguably offline commerce, or lack of awareness of online solutions among consumers, is the maincompetitor since online represents less than five percent of retail sales across Southeast Asia. But the rise in smartphone sales, which brings millions of people online for the first time, is changing things, and Indonesia, as Southeast Asias largest country, has the greatest potential in that respect.Fichet told TechCrunch that the new money raised will be put to work building out Oramis product selection, increasing its technology team  which currently stands at 40 employees  and improving the end-to-end experience with customers, so investing in better logistics, order management, etc. Beyond that,Kalayanamitr is working to unlock the potential of social commerce for Orami. Thats the idea thatsocial media is intertwined with the service  so, for example, customers can easily share new purchases, wishlists, etc with friends.Orami is focused on Indonesia and Thailand, the market where Moxy started out, and it may expand to one more market in Southeast Asia this year. Initially though, the Oram founderssaid, the company needs to focus on Indonesia and build its position there.Just Indonesia alone is going to be crazy for us, wevetapped a fraction of it so far,Kalayanamitr told TechCrunch.When Orami does look to expand, it is possible that it might look for an acquisition to hit the ground running. Thats not a huge surprise since Orami is the result of a merger, and Moxy itself acquired Thai startup WhatsNew when it first started out. Indonesia is the focus today, but Orami clearly harbors ambitions to be the e-commerce site of choice for women in Southeast Asia.
