FacebooksFree Basics  the companys zero-rated mobile service  has been under fire in India over net neutrality violations for months, and now the countrys regulator has weighed in hard on the issue: FreeBasics and services like it have been banned, according to an announcement from TRAI.Facebook has issued a statement in response to the ruling that looks like it will continue to work on ways of growing its service, despite this obvious setback.Our goal with Free Basics is to bring more people online with an open, non-exclusive and free platform, a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. While disappointed with the outcome, we will continue our efforts to eliminate barriers and give the unconnected an easier path to the internet and the opportunities it brings.TRAI notes that theregulations will be in place for two years but may be open for review  which could see Facebook tweak FreeBasics and try to get the service turned on again.Companies thatviolate the rules will be fined 50,000 rupees per day (around $740/day), according to the ruling, up to a maxiumum of 5 million rupees.Those numbers are negligible for Facebook, which has invested millions in this program, but its a crucial public opinion victory against the company that is at stake here.FreeBasics is Facebooksstrategy to build up its user base in developing parts of the world by teaming up with carriers in local markets to give free access to specific sites (like Facebook) by way of a group it founded called Internet.org. In India, Facebook had been working with Reliance Telecom to offer the service.The ban todaycomes after TRAI temporarily banned the service in December.To be clear, theannouncement and the wider reportthat lay out the conclusion in greater detail do not single outFacebook or FreeBasics by name, but it was the emergence of this program that caused outcry and prompted the investigation by the regulator. The new rules, furthermore, outlinethe essentials of FreeBasics as the kind of service that will no longer be allowed:Facebook is possibly the most high-profile advocate of unmetered selective service, but there have been others like Flipkart that have tried to team up with carriers like Airtel to provide unmetered service around their specific mobile apps.Its not clear how specific carriers versus content providers are being impacted by todays rules.The ruling comes after TRAI opened a consultationwith key stakeholders in December and an open house forum to discuss the rules in January.While this may bea victory for net neutrality supporters, others mightsee it as a step backfor the wider growth of smartphone usage in the country, where a large part of the population cannot afford services without subsidies.But as a solution to that problem, FreeBasicshas been something of a PR disaster for Facebook, with even the companys attempt to start a Save FreeBasics campaign backfiring after it sparkedcontroversy.Those trying to get the regulator to weigh in unsurprisingly celebrated todays news:We applaud TRAIs finding against differentially priced data services, and are delighted by the regulators recognition of the irreversible damage that stands to be done to the open Internet by allowing differential pricing, saidMishi Choudhary, executive director, SFLC.in, in a statement. The Internet is no more and no less than a dumb pipe delivering data to and from its users. Differential pricing runs counter to this fundamental premise, which has had no small role to play in the Internets explosive growth. In this context, TRAIs latest Regulations are a big step in the right direction, and secure India a position amongst the select few nations to have accorded legislative respect for the principle of network neutrality. Further, we specially appreciate the fact that TRAIs decision has come in the form of immediately enforceable Regulations as we had requested, and not recommendations that require legislative or executive sanction.
