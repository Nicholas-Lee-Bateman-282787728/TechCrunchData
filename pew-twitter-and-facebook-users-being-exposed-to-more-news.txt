U.S. users of Twitter and Facebookareincreasingly gettingexternalnews via the twoservices, accordingto anew study by the PewResearch Center.The share of Americans for whom Twitter andFacebook serve as a source of news is continuingto rise. This rise comes primarily from morecurrent users encountering news there ratherthan large increases in the user base overall, the report notes.The researchers report substantial growth in the proportion of adult web users saying each platform serves as a source for news about events and issues outside of friends and family  with 63 per cent of Facebook users and the same proportion of Twitter users now saying that, up from a majority (52 per cent) of Twitter users and 47 per cent of Facebook users back in 2013.Pews data shows thisbehavioral increasecutting across almost alldemographic groups  includingusers under 35 (growing from 55% to 67%), and those 35 and older (rising from 47% to59%). While onFacebook, news usegrew among both men (44% to 61%) and women (49% to 65%) over the two years. Younger users remain more likely to get their news via Facebook than Twitter, according to the study.Both tech platforms preferto couch themselves ascontent distributionplatforms, rather than content publishers  typically denying theyhave a role ineditorially shaping what their userssee, despite making what some might term editorial judgements to, for instance, remove certain types of content from their platforms. Add to that,theiralgorithms continually make judgementsto curate or personalize the content their users see.Whats clear is that as social medias role in the distribution and sourcing of news becomes more dominant, and the role of techalgorithms in foregrounding and disseminating certain content/content types (and vice versa)becomes more apparent, questions about how digital platforms areinfluencing public opinion will continue to grow.As social networking sites recognize and adapt to their role in the news environment, each will offerunique features. These different ways of connecting with news have implications for how Americanslearn about the world and their communities, and for how they take part in the democratic process, notesAmy Mitchell, Pew Research Centers director ofjournalism research, in a statement.Facebook also recently launched a program to natively host publishers content  called Facebook Instant Articles  with the aim ofreducing article load times in the hopes ofkeeping users sticking around on its platform for longer. Partnering with media firmsdirectly positions Facebook even closer to the already rather fuzzy dividing-line between publisher and platform.As you might expect, Pews study also highlights some significant differences in news distribution strengths between Facebook and Twitter,with Twitter  unsurprisingly, given its sharpening focus on live events  being used far more by people wanting tofollowbreaking news vsFacebook (59 per cent vs 31 per cent).The researchers also found that different habits and topics are more suited to different platforms  such as people on Twitter being more likely to follow news organizations, reporters or commentators (46% vs 28%); while Facebook users are more likely to post and respond to news content about government and politics:About a third (32%) of Facebook users say they post aboutgovernment and politics on Facebook and 28% comment on these types of posts. In comparison, 25% ofTwitter users tweet about this news topic and 13% reply to tweets on this topic posted by others.The study also found four topics were seen at a higher rate on Twitter vs Facebook  namely: national government and politics (72% vs. 61%);international affairs (63% vs. 51%); business (55% vs. 42%); and sports (70% vs. 55%).The notion that Facebook users aresitting within a personalized filter bubble has been long discussed  culminating, in anotable instance last summer, in users pointing outthe stark contrast inwhat they saw on their Facebook vs Twitter feeds during the Ferguson protests.Pews results appear to bear out that Twitter news users are more likely to be regularly exposed to newspostsacross a more diverse range oftopics than those sourcing news viaFacebook:The researchers note some gender differences in news consumption habits on the two platforms too.On Facebook, Pew foundwomen are more likely to regularly see posts about health, entertainment, and people and events inyour community; while posts about weather, entertainment, crime, and health are more commonlyseen by women on Twitter.When it comes to news users of the platformscommenting onnews, the proportion acrossboth platforms was about the roughly same, according to Pew with around aquarter of both Facebook (28%) and Twitter (23%) news users at least sometimesposting or tweeting about news.The studyis based on a survey ofmore than 2,000 U.S. adults, including 331 Twitter users and 1,315Facebook users  a proportion which Pew notes reflects the representative differences inthe number of Americans who use each platform.
