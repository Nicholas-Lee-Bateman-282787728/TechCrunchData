Xiaomis much-speculated second wearable device is now official, after the Chinese company unveiled the Mi Band Pulse.A report from Canalys earlier this year speculated that theMi Band, the companys debut wearable,made Xiaomi the worlds second largest seller of wearablesbehind only Fitbit. That was before the Apple Watch went on sale, of course,butthis follow-up builds on that potential.Beyond tracking your steps and sleep, alarms and some notifications, the Mi Band Pulseincludes a heart rate tracker, as previouslyspeculated. That addition  the device uses PPG to measure your heart rate  has made it slightly larger than its predecessor. The original Mi Band took a little time to add iPhone support, butXiaomis website confirms that the wearable will work with both Android (4.4 or later) and iOS (iPhone 4S / iOS 7.0 upwards) from the get-go.Most importantly, the device has retained a low price tag. Thats 99 CNY, or around $15, this time around. The original Mi Band will still be available for those seeking something more basic, with a slightly lower price of 69 CNY,or around $11.Fans of Xiaomi and its low-priced tech gadgets may be disappointed to hear that the wearable will go on sale in China only initially, as part of the countrys massive 11/11 Singles Day online shopping festival.Xiaomi told us that it doesnt yethave anything to sayaboutinternational sales.However, we expect the Mi Band Pulse to be available outside of China soon,since the Mi Band itself retails in India, Europe and the U.S. too via Xiaomis global Mi.com store.I bought a Mi Band recently as an inexpensive way to test whether fitness tracking is something that I want to take seriously. With the addition of a heart rate tracker, Xiaomijust made dabbling in this areamore compelling  although wehavent tested theMi Band Pulse outyet.Hat tip 9to5Google
