With all of the revelations of data snooping and privacy violationsat the hands of government agencies and clandestine hacker groups, a new report suggests young people are having buyers remorse regardingthe amount of social media accounts theyvepoured their life details into.In a report released this week (oddly) by USA Network, survey data shows that 55 percent of young people would eschew social media entirely if they could start fresh. Additionally, if major breaches of their privacy were to continue, 75 percent of young people said they were at least somewhat likely to deactivate their personal social media accounts, with23 percent sayingthey were highly likely to do so.Young Americans sense of privacy online has been so violated that most of them believe that its safer to store their personal datain a box than in the cloud. Indeed, the survey said that physical filing systems were actually listed as the most trusted personal data storage method for young people.So, are we really just one WikiLeaks bombshell away from a mass exodus of young people from social media sites?Id be pretty shockedif that werethe case.The disconnect between young peoples stated beliefs regarding privacy and how theyactually seem to have respondedto instances of their data being used is an interesting takeawayfrom this report.Other surveyshave shown that the perceived usefulness of social media has, in fact, made young people indifferentto how companies end up using their data.In a summary statement from a major Pew Research study on young peoples views of online privacy following the Snowden leaks, Pew said:Put it all together, and a picture emerges of young adults who are more willing than older Americans to let companies use their personal data for commercial purposes, in exchange for the social-networking functions they value, but are more skeptical about the governments implicit security-for-privacy bargain.Young peoples views on privacy are complicated topicsto nail down, but what this report does shed light on is just how important dealing with user privacy concernsis for tech companies  at least from a public relations standpoint.Its apparent that someare paying close attention to the topic, but if other companies decide to ignore the issue and call young peoples bluff, this report suggests that it could be disastrous.
