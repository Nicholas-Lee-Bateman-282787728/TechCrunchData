Video on-demand is looking like a hot market in Asia in 2015,after iFlix, one of a number of Netflix-like services to have sprouted up in Southeast Asia, landed a $30 million investmentahead of its imminent launch.iFlix was first announcedin March by Catcha Group  a Malaysia-based organization that runs a plethora of online businesses, including group buying site Ensogo  andEvolution Media Capital, and it plans to begin rolling out this quarter. The $30 million injection of capital has come from Catcha itself, and PLDT, a telecom conglomerate in the Philippines.The money will go towards bringingthe service tomore countries in Southeast Asia, increasing its catalog which iFlix pegs at a vague over 10,000 hours of content and financingamarketing push. Interestingly, iFlix said also that it will use the funds to produce original programming. Thats something that Netflix has done with great success, and with industry accolades to boot.An iFlix spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company isworking with local and regional production companies rather than independent producers on original content. I dont expect to see House Of Cards, butit will be fascinatingto see exactly what kind of contentthat it develops given that its audience is Southeast Asian consumers and not those in the West.Netflix stepped into Asia Pacific this year with an entry into Australia and New Zealand. It is due to come to Japan this fall,but Southeast Asia  and its 600 million cumulative population  does not appear to be on the cards any time soon, hence the early rush to market from a number of competitors.iFlix isnt alone in sensing a first mover opportunity in Southeast Asia. Earlier this year, telecom giant SingTel partnered with Sony and Warner to launch HOOQ, another Netflix competitor that is targeting the region with a focus on mobile. HOOQ went live in the Philippines in February, and iFlix is initially targeting the Philippines and Malaysia in Q2 2015 we can expect both companies to move intoSoutheast Asias most prominent countries this year.This battle is welcome news for film lovers in theregion who havelong cast jealous glances at the bevy of programming available to audiences in other parts of the world.
