Our video team was certainly able to get to Postmates HQ in less than an hour, since it is located literally right next door to TechCrunchs headquarters in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco.Since Postmates delivery service never sleeps, the company is staffed with a 24-hour customer service team that is in the office at all times of the day and night. Watch the video embedded above to see the office that keeps Postmates ticking around the clock.Check it all out in the video embedded above, and see some snaps in the gallery below!
