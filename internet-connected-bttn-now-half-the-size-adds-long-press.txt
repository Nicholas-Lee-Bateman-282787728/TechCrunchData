Internet connected button maker, bttnhas launched a smaller version of its push-to-activate-a-digitalservice gadget.The concept of bttn is simple: a push button device that can beplaced somewhere in your home or business and linked with a digital action  such as ordering a taxi, or sending a pre-configured text message to say Im home!.Whatever your chosen custom action/s, they aretriggeredwhen someonepushes the hardware button. So, in other words, noneed to interact with a pesky app.The new bttn Mini is about half the size of the first gen bttn (which went up for pre-order in May 2014), and also includes an additionalaction to complicate matters (slightly): a long press which can be set tocancel or confirm a prior push.The Finnish startup behind bttn, which also ran a successful crowdfunding campaign to get its gizmo to market, says the devicehas been most popular with small businesses so far  and its those customers thathavebeen asking for the additional long press cancel/confirm option.Happily the new feature is not limited to the bttn Mini; existing bttn users will be getting theirextra push via a future firmware update.The startup isnot disclosing exactly how many bttns its shipped at this point but says its more than 10,000 and less than 100,000 (so probably not vast quantities; its been shipping its buttons for just over two years at this point, with buyers in more than 100 countries).The basic bttncosts69 for consumers,or99 for a branded version. Businesses do not buy individual bttnsbut pay a subscription, with pricing dependent on bttn volumes and length of time they sign up for the service.One bttnbuyer is Frances largest radio taxi operator, Les Taxis Bleus, which the startup says uses bttn in itsconcierge service, as well as distributing branded bttnstorestaurants, hotels andboutiques  where customers are frequently in need of a taxi (thats certainly one way for the taxi industry to fight Uber).Another example it mentions is Samsic, a real-estate and property management company that uses branded bttns in offices and buildings to signal on-site service or support need.Plus it saysonline stores are also using its bttns to offer awell-know re-order function  much like Amazons Dash buttons for ordering staple products, then. (Also oneway for smaller ecommerce businesses to try to keep up with the Amazon behemoth.)Three types of connectivity are being offered for the new bttn Mini:mobile data, SIGFOX and Wi-Fi.The mobile data version of the bttn Mini is shipping from today, with the wi-fi version coming in July and SIGFOX as of Q3.
