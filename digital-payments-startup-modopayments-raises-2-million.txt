Today, The Dallas Business Journal is reporting thatModoPayments completed a $2 Million funding round by a group of individual angels that includesTim Keith, John Beletic, and Jay Kassing among others.We first reported on ModoPayments way back in 2011 when they were still primarily focused on building a mobile payments platform for storemerchants tomonetized location check-ins.A lot has changed for the Richardson, TX startup since those salad days andthey quietly launcheda veryinteresting productlast fall called their Digital Payments Hub.This hubis aSwiss Army Knife of moving value between and along multiple financial systemslegacy systems and new systems.Value could be defined as money, but it could also be things like loyalty points or coupons. The Digital Payments Hubuses a proprietary, secure data container called a COIN (not to be confused with the modularpayment card for which Modos patentprecedes by several years) to move the value/data along their network.Its complicated but the explainer video at ModoPaymentss website does a great job of metaphorically displayinghow the system works in the background.I spoke with Founder and CEO Bruce Parker this afternoon about their pivot to this larger backend integration productand he explained the transition as such:We spent a few years chasing the mobile payments dragon, and came to the conclusion we didnt have much to add to the discussion about the new digital user experiences. We are, however, extraordinary payments plumbers. So we decided to help solve the problems of integrating existing payments systems to the digital ecosystem.
