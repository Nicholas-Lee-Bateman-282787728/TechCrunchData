A wonderfully random, terrifyingly sentient robot.Meet InspiroBot, an artificial intelligence dedicated to generating unlimited amounts of unique inspirational quotes for endless enrichment of pointless human existence.In other words: it boils the whole inspirational image concept down to a mad lib structure.
