Dishs newly launched streaming video subscription service Sling TVannounced this morning the addition of two more channels, AMC and IFC, which will now become available as part of its $20 core package aimed at cord cutters. In addition, Sling TV customers will also be able to optionally subscribe to a new movie-focused add-on pack called Hollywood Extra for $5 per month, which includes content from EPIX and Sundance TV.Specifically, the Hollywood Extra pack brings in content from EPIX, EPIX2, EPIX3, and EPIX Drive-In, the company says. The pack also introduces a replay feature which will allow viewers the ability to watch programming thats up to a week old on demand, as an alternative to using a DVR.Thats a larger catch up window than Sling TV offers for some of its other channels, like HGTV and Food Network, for example, which have a three-day catch-up optionavailable. Meanwhile, otherchannels like those from Disney-ESPN and Turner offer no catch-up window at all, which points to one of the challenges that Sling TV is having in negotiating these deals with content providers  everyone wants to set their own terms. But in doing so, itcan lead to consumer confusion about whats actually available and for how long. It also doesnt help to make the case for switching away from acable companysDVR to on-demand streaming, as content availability is still sovaried at present.With the arrival of the newly added channels AMC and IFC, customers will have access to some of cable TVs top-rated shows, including popular AMC series likeThe Walking Dead, Better Call Saul and, in the near future, Mad Men, as well as the IFC seriesPortlandia. These channels will now be a part of the basepackage Sling TV sells, which also includes ESPN, ESPN2,TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, IFC, El Rey, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, ABC Family, Disney Channel, CNN and Galavision.The two new channels will also offer the three-day catch-up window for some of their content at launch.Video-on-demand content from AMC, IFC and Sundance TV will be made available soon, the company notes in its announcement, as will 2,000 movie and other entertainment titles from EPIX.Sling TV had previously announced an agreement with AMC Networks, which also included the rights to stream programming fromBBC America, BBC World News and WE tv. However, the companyisnt currently offering details as to when these channels will become available, it notes, only saying that customers will hear about those channels availability in the coming weeks.
