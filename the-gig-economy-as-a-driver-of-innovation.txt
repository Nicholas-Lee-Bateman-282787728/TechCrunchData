Business models that fall under thegig economy umbrellahave been proven for business-to-consumer and peer-to-peer markets because they make it possible to crowdsource products and services from huge communities of people.Large online networks can also be some of the greatest sources of innovation. Led by the enterprise and government research and development verticals, this trend is growing rapidly because ofa shift in focus from single-point services to the co-creation (collaborative innovation) model.Some of the most novel case studies and applications of innovation and crowdsourcing are coming from unexpected places: large enterprises and government agencies. Driven by pressure for continued growth and tapping talent outside their workforce, large companies like Apple, IBM, GEand ahost of othershave launched prize challenges seeking innovative ideas, products and software solutions.Even the U.S. government is launchingchallenges at an unprecedented rate. Arecent report by Deloitte estimated that more than $60 million in prizes was offered through the Challenge.govplatform. The annual America COMPETESprogress reportreleased by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy reported that 17agencies launched prize challenges in 2014  seven of them being first-timers. This increased activity has contributed to a growing market for innovation and crowdsourcing capabilities, resulting in a recent $20 million worth ofopen innovation service contracts with NASA.As the market for innovation and crowdsourcing continues to grow, the enterprise customer is searching for co-creation frameworks that can deliver real value. One such framework is theCatalyst modelthat I co-founded and implemented at the Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).Catalyst builds real startups with prototypes from communities of innovators. Best suited for early-stage innovation in verticals where prototyping is inexpensive, Catalyst links a community of energy entrepreneurs (using theIdeaScale platform)to a community of developers and designers inAppirios Topcoder platform.Catalyst delivers real value through a four-step co-creation framework: (1)ideationto find the top pain points and wish list of a specific vertical, (2)team formationanchored by a business solution addressing the pain points or wish list, (3)rapid prototypingusing crowdsourced software development and (4)incubationwhere teams are incentivized to grow and scale.The framework has been one of the few in open innovation to successfully link ideation to incubationand has been shown to be scalable across EERE, garnering funding in two rounds from the Solar Energy Technologies Office and the Building Technologies Office.In 2015, a $2 million prizebacked 36 early-stage teams with prototypes and was shown to be 2x as fast and 10x as cost-effective to comparable phase I and phase IISmall Business Innovation Research grants. In addition to media coverage from non-traditional outlets likeTechCrunch, the program won a host of accolades, including the 2015 International Society for Professional Innovation ManagementGrand Prize.With increasing enterprise investment being made in innovation and crowdsourcing, a new workforce with new skills will be needed to deliver results from co-creation business models. In recent years we have seen the rise ofthe community manager,whose duties can range from growth hacking to improvement of the community.With co-creation it is necessary to have a super-community manager(manager of multiple community managers) whose concern is not only engagement, butintegration. Crowdsourcing and crowd-powered tools have beendescribed by Peter Diamandisto be an exponential technology because of the exceptional access to innovation and enablement that they provide.Now, imagine the value of the new gig economy where communities of exponential capability not only deliver unique solutions, but their collaboration has a force multiplier effect that delivers game-changing innovation.
