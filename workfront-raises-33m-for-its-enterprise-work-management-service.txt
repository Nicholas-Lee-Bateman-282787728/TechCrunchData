Work management solution Workfront (previously known as AtTask) today announced that it has raised a $33 million Series E funding round led by growth equity firm JMI Equity, which also previously led the companys $38 million Series D round last year. Greenspring Global Partners and Atlas Peak also participated in this round. The company has now raised a total of $95 million.Workfront currently mostly markets its services at marketing, IT and services teams, but the solution isnt limited to those kind of teams. It offers these teams everything from basic project and task management services to more elaborate workflow automation, approval, document management and proofing tools. Workfronts customers include Cisco, Comcast, Trek and Cars.com.The company says it plans to use the new funds to execute on the companysbusiness development and growth initiatives.This round of funding will support the sales, marketing, andproduct strategy we have defined, with the objective to be the dominant provider ofenterprise work management solutions, Workfront CEO Eric Morgan said in todays announcement. We are extremely pleased to have JMI lead thisround of funding. With its successful track record of building world-class SaaSorganizations, JMI will continue to help us capitalize on our market opportunity whileexpanding our offerings and support for our enterprise clients.Workfront seems to offer more robust enterprise tools than some of its competitors, but its obviously operating in a very competitive market with well-funded upstarts like Asana and companies like Atlassian, which is now seeing a lot of traction for its project management tools outside of its traditional developer-centric market.
