Welcome back to our temporary CrunchWeek set as we rebuild Video Land here at TCHQ. This week Sarah Lane, Ryan Lawlerand myself dug into the weeks most important topics: Facebooks work to bring user-to-user payments to Messenger, the inside scoop on how fast Lyft is growing, and what was the big new thing at this years SXSW festival.Oh, and a small point: TechCrunch is launching a new daily show called Crunch Report that our own Sarah Lane will host starting Monday. Thats mere days from now. Were pretty excited.Now, crack a beer, sit back and kick it with us.
