Today a panel of New York State Supreme Court appellate judges decided to extend the temporary stay that was recently granted to DraftKings and FanDuel, meaning they can legally operate in NY until their appeal is decided.As a refresher, In December New YorkState Supreme Court Judge Manuel Mendez upheld a cease-and-desist request from New York Attorney GeneralEric T. Schneiderman, meaningDraftKings and FanDuel would have tocease operating in New York.However, a few hours after that decision,DraftKings receivedan expediated motion to appeal and stay the decision, meaning both companiescould temporarily continue to operate while the appeal is being considered.Todays decision extends that temporary ruling, meaning both companies can indefinitelyoperate in NYC until the appeal until decided.In a statement from DraftKings counsel, the company reiterated that they expect the appeal to be decided in their favor, and consider todays ruling a logical step in getting DFS legalized:We are pleased with the Courts ruling today. Daily Fantasy Sports contests are as legal now as they have been for the past seven years that New Yorkers have been playing them. As our litigation continues, we expect an appellate court to see what we have known since the outset:DFS is a game of knowledge and skill, one that builds community and whose competitive spirit has become important to the lives of millions of people. Our ongoing appeal will make clear that daily fantasy contests require just as much skill as season-long contests, which the Attorney General recognizes as perfectly legal under state law. David Boies, counsel to DraftKings and Chairman, Boies, Schiller and Flexner LLPNow, all parties must wait until the appealis heard before the New York Supreme Court later this year. Until then, DraftKings and FanDuellive to fight another day in NY.
