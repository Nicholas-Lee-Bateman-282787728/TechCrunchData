Is the American political system broken?Yes it is  at least according to BrigadeCEO Matt Mahan who founded Brigade with his old friend Sean Parker.Mahan, a Harvard graduate who began his activist career by leveraging Facebook data to be elected Student Body President, believes that the fundamental problem with American politics is the absence of digital platforms for civic engagement.People care deeply about issues, Mahan says, but they havent had the networking tools to organize and promote their causes. And that, of course, is where Brigade, which is a platform for civic engagement,comes in.Founded a year ago with seed money from Ron Conway, Marc Benioff and Sean Parker, Brigade has spent this summer in private beta. But now its ready for a public launch and Mahan expects it to have millions of users by November 2016.
