While Airbnbdukes it out with local regulatorsandfights off encroaching rivals, the company continues to look at ways ofincreasing the margins that it makes around its accommodation service andimproving overall loyalty onits platform. In the latest move, Airbnb appears to be working on an Experience Card  a prepaid MasterCard credit card for international Airbnb guests to spend up to $1,000 while travelling inthe U.S. coveringmost goods and services.A source at Airbnb says theExperience Card is still in itsexploratory phase. In other words, itis not yet being piloted or tested.But from the looks of the whatweve seen in a staging area, there has been a lot of groundwork laid regardless: in addition to a home page, there isa detailed page of terms of use, a FAQ page, and a Cardholder Agreement page. (Update: Since thisarticle was published,cached links to thehome page havedisappeared. The other three still exist for now in cache form.)From the home page, it looks like theExperience Card wouldhave two main functions: as a prepaid card for up to$1,000; and as a loyaltycard. For the latter, usersearn back 10% of each card purchase as a credit towardsfuturetransactions on Airbnb. To sweeten the deal, the companyalso notes that Experience Card users geta map of recommendations from locals to help plan their trip.The Cardholder Agreement page notes that Airbnb would workwith Ohio-based Sutton Bankto provide the card. Sutton works with a number of otherthird parties on prepaid cards, includingSprint onits Money Express product.The Terms of Use note that the purpose of the program is to provide the Card as a payment method for Airbnb users traveling to the United States for purchases during their Trip.Experience Cardwas first spotted byMatteo Gamba, after he founda page describingthe service that wentlive briefly onAirbnb.Interestingly, it seems to have surfaced just around the time that some regular usersstarted to get contacted over a similarly named Airbnb service, Experiences, which sounds like the local recommendations that are a part of the Experience Card. The Experiences feature was flagged on ProductHunt earlier this week,along witha note from Airbnb inviting the posterto share his experiences:Youve travelled quite a bit on Airbnb, so I wanted to invite you to be one of the first experience hosts here in San Francisco, the note reads. Were looking for amazing folks to share authentic San Francisco dinner parties, food and pub crawls, and brunch gatherings the week of December 1st. Whether its an intimate dinner at your house, a ros brunch in the park, dinner and a bonfire at the beach, or a serendipitous excursion to your favorite pop-up in the Mission, every idea you share is a chance for a traveler to belong in San Francisco.Experiences haveactually been livein the form of a test since May 2014, but the December 1 note seems to imply that this is when a more formal on switch may get flipped.Turning back to theExperience Card, the home page invites users to Spend like a New Yorker  easily and securely. While thecard comes preloaded with $1,000, you only get chargedfor what is spent on the card, and only after the trip is finished  presumably usingthe payment details that Airbnb already holds for you.Thecard itself is free to obtain,but there are limits.Airbnb notes in itsFAQsthatwhile youcan use the card for purchases anywhere MasterCard is accepted, itcannot be used for car rentals, recurring expenseslikephone bills, online gambling, hotel spend (!), cash withdrawal at an ATM or cash back at the register, or at Automated Fuel Dispensers at gasoline stations.For a while now, Airbnb  which reportedlyraised $1.5 billion on a $25.5 billion valuation in June of this year  has been looking for ways of expanding the experience on its platform beyond the initial act of looking for and booking accommodation.Other efforts have includedNeighborhoods, which are hyperlocal travel guides; andLocal Lounges, which enlist local cafes and other venues to welcome visitors into neighborhoods and provide information to them.The Experience Card is a way for Airbnb to close that loop. Now Airbnb not only points you to places to go, but it helps you spend money while you are there.MasterCard is not the only payment company working with Airbnb  the company also announced a tie-up with American Express at the beginning of November that will let AmEx account holders sign upto Airbnb using their AmEx.com username and password, and then use AmExs instant checkout to make bookings and spend Membership Rewards. Airbnb also offers gift cards as a way of virtualising the payment experience for users and to expand money spent on its platformThe Experience Card could help Airbnb improve its own margins on users.For those who are travelling in the same country where they live, the card could prove useful as another line of credit for your trip. For those travelling to the U.S. from abroad,this could prove to be an attractive alternative to using their own from-home payment cards. (What is less clear is whether Airbnb would charge its own exchange fee, or what rate it would use, when it deducts what youve spent in your local currency.)The Experience Card and its rewards program could also help userssimply feel more tied to the Airbnb experience and feel like they are getting a bigger bang for their buck.Expedias acquisition of HomeAway is one signal for why Airbnb needs to up its game on that front: Expedia users willbe able to rent theirtraditional hotel alternatives, and book their flights, cars and find deals on things to do, all in one place.There may be more services developed down the line: Airbnbin September acquired and shut down multi-city planning app Vamo, and while it did not buy activity concierge site Sosh, it clearly has an interest in goingbeyond accommodation and into accommodating activities on its platform.Updated with more detail.
