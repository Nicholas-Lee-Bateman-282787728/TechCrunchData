Spotify announced the addition of video clips, adaptable songs for runners and other new features at an event earlier today. Afterwards, I met with Vice President of Product Charlie Hellman, who gave me a quick demo.The video above should give you at least a glimpse of how the new features will work. Hellman also discussed why it made sense to add new content types to Spotify. It might seem a little strange for him to describe Spotify as a music company at heart when its adding video clips from NBC, ABC, CBS Radio, Vice News, Comedy Central and many more, but Hellman said:Hellman added that as Spotify introduces exclusive video content, much of it will be connected to music in some way.
