Many of you probably know CB Insights as the venture capital database that puts out reports about trendslikethe on-demand economy and compiles lists of unicorn startups. Today, the company is expanding far beyond the ventureworldwith the launch of CB Insights For Sales, a product that puts its private and public company knowledge to work on the sales floor.CB Insights was launched by former VC Anand Sanwal in 2009 under the name ChubbyBrain, which didnt go over so well, as you can imagine. The company quickly rebranded to CB Insights, avoiding a lot of jokes but further confusing much of the startup community due to the similarity between CB andCrunchBase(which shares a founder and parent company with TechCrunch).Identity crisis aside, CB Insights has grown to millions in annual revenue over the past five years and signed upmore than 300 customers that use its analytics platform to source deals, analyze competition, and build reports.Now, powered by$1.15 million in equity-free investment from the National Science Foundation, CB Insights is launching a lead gen toolbuilton top of its existingdatabase and analytics tools.The way that B2B salespeople do their job today is often pretty archaic, its totally undifferentiated and just sort of spray and pray, says Sanwal. So you give us a list of your existing customers, and well identity programmatically all the companies that are similar that you should be talking to.With CB Insights For Sales, an iteration on the business intelligence tools that CB Insights provides, sales groups input a list of their current customers, and the platform spits out a list of new leads, ranked by relevancy.CB Insights is already crawling millions of news articles to pick up on funding and acquisition news. So the CB Sales algorithm looks to see which companies are frequently referenced together in the press, along with a handful of more obvious factors, like company size, funding, and industry, to determine similarity. These results are scored, ranked, and integrated into Salesforce, so salespeople see a list ofprioritized leads and a complete profile for each one.If a company on thislist raises a big round of funding or postsa bunch of jobs on LinkedIn, the platform will notify the sales teamand re-score that company accordingly.CB Insights has been working with existing customers like Marketo and Gartner to buildout CB Sales, but starting today the serviceavailable to the public. And itsonly the first application of the companys existing dataset and analytics tech.For salespeople, its who is my next potential lead; for corporate strategy, its what is the next hot industry; for people in competitive intelligence, its whats Googles next big move, Sanwal says. We want to use data to provide insight into all of these things.
