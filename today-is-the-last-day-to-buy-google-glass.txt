Google is ending the Glass experiment.After today, Google will stop selling the novel device  at least in its current form. Google insists the product is still in developmentand its highly likely that a new version will eventually be released.News broke last week that the Google Glass will be pulled from the market and the project was spinning out of Google X skunkworks toexist as a standalone project. Former Apple executive and Nest founder Tony Fadell is now overseeing the project.The future of Glass rests in capable hands.Glass launched with much fanfare three years ago in April 2012 and failed to become a consumer hit. But it did spark imaginative ideas, which could have been Googles plan all along.As a Google spokesperson told us last week, the idea behind the Explorer program was always to see how people would use the technology. Now that Google has received quite a bit of feedback  both good and bad  it decided to close the program in order to focus on future versions of Glass.The current version of Google Glass will continue to work, but dont expect official software updates. As of writing, Google Glass is widely available from the Play Store even though today is the last day theyre officially available.
