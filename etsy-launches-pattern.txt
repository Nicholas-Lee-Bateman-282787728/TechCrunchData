With the launch of a new service called Pattern,Etsy is making it easier for people to sell custom goods on their own websites.Apparently, more than one-third of Etsys1.6 million active sellers have said theyre interested in setting up their own site, but they found the process of registering a domain,creating a site, maintaining it and managing the inventory too complicated.With Pattern, those sellers can create a site in just a few minutes  a feat that Etsy product lead Joe Lallouz demonstrated this morning for an audience of journalists at the companys Brooklyn headquarters. Sellers can register web domains from within Pattern, then choose from five existing themes (some of them emphasizing a sellersbrand and story, others putting the products for sale front-and-center.)Of course, an easy-to-use website builder is not a new idea, so what really makes Pattern different is its integration with Etsy. When you set up a Pattern website, Etsy automatically imports your content and inventory from your store, and will keep everything synced up. Youll also be able to see analytics for your Etsy store and your Pattern website side-by-side on the same dashboard.As Lallouz put it, the aim is to provide two shops in one  you only worry about managing one store while getting the benefits of both.Our focus is delivering value toexisting Etsysellers, added Senior Vice President of Product Mike Grishaver in an interview. Weve spent agreat deal of time and research to find what are the pain points for an Etsyseller and were building tools to address those.When I suggested that otherEtsy sellers might already have their own websites and would appreciate morestore integrations with the webpublishing tools that already exist, Grishaver said there are no current plans, but, You did identify a real pain point.Looking at the bigger picture, while Etsy finished 2015 on a strong note, it hasstruggled to impress Wall Streetsince it went public last year. Services like this could help Etsy retain sellers and attract new ones. It could also help them make more money from those sellers  after a 30-day trial, Etsy will cost $15 a month.Etsy is also announcing a redesigned landing page for each Etsy seller, called the Shop Home. The new page is more brand- and image-centric, leading with a big cover image. Its also optimized to look goodon both desktop and the mobile web.Sonia Kedzierski, Etsys product manager for membership and identity, said the goal of these changes is to highlight that human connection [between buyer and seller] even more.
