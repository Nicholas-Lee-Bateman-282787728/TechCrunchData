Drones were one of the hot topics coming into CES, but the show itself didnt actually feature any standout products. Many of the new drones we saw were little more than knockoffs of DJIs extremely successful Phantom Vision line (though there were a few interesting exceptions). Maybe its no surprise then that the largest U.S.-based drone manufacturer, 3D Robotics, didnt even have a booth at the show. Instead, 3D Robotics CEO Chris Anderson  the former editor-in-chief of Wired  toured the city with a drone in his backpack.We got a chance to catch up with Anderson to talk aboutselfie drones, the FAAs regulations around commercial drone usage and the future of both his company and the industry as a whole. Drones cant just be about taking aerial selfies, after all.
