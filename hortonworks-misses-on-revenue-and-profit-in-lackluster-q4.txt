Lets talk about money!Hortonworks reported its earnings today, the first time it has as a public company! :)Revenues for its fourth quarter totaled $12.7 million, up 55 percent on year-over-year basis. :)But investors had expected the company to report revenue of $13.42 million. :(The company lost money in the quarter, $90.6 million using normal accounting methods (GAAP). :(Using adjusted metrics, however, that loss is only $36.9 million for the period. :)That works out to a much smaller $2.19 per share loss. :)But investors had expected a narrower loss of $2.04 per share. :(Hortonworks expects its revenue to grow to $17.5 to $18.5 million in the current quarter. :)That is way above street expectations of $15.2 million for quarter. :)Which is why, I surmise, the company hasnt tanked in after-hours trading after reporting its dullish fourth quarter. :)Hortonworks is only down 2.48 percent, a haircut after missing on both top and bottom lines. :)Provided that Hortonworks can make its current-quarter projections, investors will be all :) as the company will have accelerated its year-over-year revenue growth from the fourth quarter. :)The company burned through a net $87.86 million in cash in 2014. The company has several years worth of reserves, given its IPO haul that swelled its coffers to north of $200 million. :)But the companys losses have been increasing over time, which could lead to the company needing more cash than one might expect. :(In short, the quarter was saved by strong guidance. If the Hortonworks team cant make their numbers, well, you know what to expect. :|
