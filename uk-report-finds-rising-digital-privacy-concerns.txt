A comprehensive study of Brits usage of and attitudes to digital media, conducted annuallyby telecoms watchdog Ofcom, suggests there is growing concern among web and app users about the privacy of their personal data.The lateststudy, published today andbased on responses gathered in 2015  the tenth year the research has been carried out  notes thatconcerns about media among users are broadly unchanged since 2013, but does flag up a rise inconcern amongapp users specifically about whats being done with their personal data.According to the research, three in ten (28%) of those who use appsnow have concerns, compared to two in ten (20%) in 2013 withsecurity/fraud or privacy (20%) being the mostcommon concern.The researchers also foundevidence of what they dub added caution amongInternet users when it comes to sharing personal information online over the past 10 years  such as increased concern about giving out a home address online.Focusing on more current attitude shifts,Ofcom says therehas been aspecific rise inprivacy consciousness since 2013, which appears to be leading to decreasing willingness to share almost all types of personal data online.From the report (emphasis mine):Nine in ten (91%) internet users say they ever (always, often or sometimes) give the minimum amount of personal information required online, with over half of those aged 55-64 (54%) and aged 65+ (61%) citing that they always give the minimum.More users say they would never provide their credit or debit card details (21% vs. 13% in 2013) or their mobile number (26% vs. 17% in 2013) because of security concerns.Furthermore, the percentage who are happy to provide personal details online has decreased for all types asked about except for email.Six in ten Facebook users say they have changed their privacy settings to make them more private, while seven in ten (72%) say they only share their photos with friends. Friends only was also cited by two-thirds of users in the case of sharing opinions about people, places or the latest news stores (66%), their real name (64%), and their current location (64%).Despite evidence of increased caution in online personal data sharing, Ofcom also found that Internet users in 2015 were more likely than in 2013 to say they dont read website terms and conditions or privacy statements at all (up from 21% to 26%).Butfrankly who can blame them. As weve said before, T&Cs/EULAs are designed to be as opaque and impenetrable as possible in order to encourage people not to read them.Moreover, clicking I do not agree on T&Cs is the fastest way not to get to use a service providing another disincentive for web users todiscover what devils lurk in the detail. When the standard digital transactionis your data forthe service then users are effectively being strong-armed intoblindlyclicking I agree.Yet Ofcoms research suggests thatpersonal data trade-off is sitting increasingly uneasily with Brits, givenrisingconcerns about what their data is being used for  and users attempts to minimize the amount of data they hand over.The Ofcom report did also findthat amajority of Brits(68%) say they arehappy to provide personal information online to companies solong as they get what they want (i.e. access to a particular digital service). But perhaps that sort of happiness is best characterized as ignorance is bliss.And with digital privacy and security issues increasingly in the media spotlight, thanks tothe 2013 Snowden revelations disclosing the extent of government mass surveillance programs  which in turn has ledmore companies to seektoproperly lock down user data via strongencryption (and very public spats such as the recent Apple vs FBI case)  it is arguably becoming harder for web users to be ignorant of data security concerns.Hence, perhaps, indications that even the famously laissez-faire Brits are becoming a bit moreconcernedabout murkygoings on with their data.Rising privacy concerns arealso perhaps an inevitable case of maturing usage of online services over the past decade, as the hidden implications/risks of sharing too much data inevitablebecoming more apparent as time goes by, with every fresh hack anddata breach.Whatever the cause of Brits growing concerns theres little doubt that security and privacy are areas ripe for startup innovation  thanks to agrowing appetite for users tounder- rather than over-share. No wonder Facebook is worried.You can read the full Ofcom report, which also tracks usage of social media, device typesand communication methods, here.
