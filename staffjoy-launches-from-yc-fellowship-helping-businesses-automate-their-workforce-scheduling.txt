Scheduling shiftsin the workplace has always been a difficult, rigid process. Balancing both employer and employee needs is always key, but getting everything to fit neatly, whileensuring that the business is properly staffed, has generally leftemployees most inconvenienced.Staffjoy is aiming to automate the process of scheduling shiftsfor businesses to help managersstaff effectively, while allowing workers more freedom in determining their own schedules.Staffjoy is one of the first companies to launch out of Y Combinators new Fellowship program. Compared to YCs full funding cycle, the fellowship operates quite a bit differently. At 8 weeks its a much shorter program, but the most important bit is that fellows receive a $12k equity-free grant from the company. The program is aimed at companies that are in the earliest stages of development.I had a chance to chat with Staffjoy co-founders Andrew Hess and Philip Thomas about their product and was able to check out a demo of the web app live in action.The app is largely focused on businesses having the right people at the right time, according to Thomas, but the manner in whichit optimizesthe employee experience is what really makes Staffjoy unique.The app organizes shifts effectivelyby initially having employees enter their availability each week into the planner component of the app. The app then accounts for whether the worker is part-time or full-time and allows them to specifythe appropriate number of hours that theyd like to work that week.Whats great is that [employees]get to choosewhat hours they want through an easy-to-use web app that helps them claim available shifts easily, Thomas said.After all of the data is entered, Staffjoys algorithm gets to work in sorting all of the employeeavailability into neat shifts that promote ahigher utilization of workers and help managers getthe right people at the right time, according to Thomas.Staffjoy has been testing their product at severalbusinesses and Thomas said theyve already seen some pretty amazing results. He pointed to one example where a business with around 50 employees was able to reduce its annual labor costs by $30k using Staffjoysautomated scheduling tools.The app is currently mostly serving businesses in the on-demand economy, which seems to be a natural fit, but Thomas and Hess told me that theyre soon hoping to branch out into approaching more traditional mom-and-pop-storesto use their software.The team seemed quite aware that businesseslike these can struggle with having too many available pieces of optimization software and said that they werealready looking toward the future, hopingtopursue partnerships with other workplace appsso that Staffjoy could neatly integrate with other services.Right now, the app is serving firms with just a few employeesas well as major on-demand companies with hundreds of contracted workers.The varying sizes of the businessestheyreserving right nowarehelping them see what models works beston a larger scale.Organizing shifts can be a tough task for employers, but Staffjoy is hoping that through automation they can produce a more fluid experience for workers and managers that doesnt leave either of them in the dark.
