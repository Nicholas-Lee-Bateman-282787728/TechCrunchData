Instagram announced today that it has 200,000 monthly active advertisers.To compare, Facebook said a year go that it had more than 2 million active advertisers, while Twitter says it has 140,000 130,000. Probably the most impressive thing about the Instagram number is the fact that the Facebook-owned photo-sharing service only had a few hundred advertisers back in June.Much of that growth has been international  Instagrams ad program expanded globally five months ago, and James Quarles, Instagrams head of business and brand development, told me that 75 percent of advertisers are outside the United States.For example, Instagram points pointed to German supermarket Rewe, which ran a campaignthat resulted in a 37 percent improvement in ad recall. Theres also Brazilian e-commerce company PetLove, whose campaign saw a30 percent lower cost per install compared to other online channels.That sounds good for advertisers, but what does this ad growth ifyoure a regular Instagram user? Are going to see more ads?Quarles said thats not necessarily the case  more advertisers doesnt have tomean more ads. In fact, he said a bigger, more diverse group ofadvertisers can improve the user experience, sinceyoure more likely to see ads that are relevant to your interests. He also noted that the number of ads you see is commensurate with amount of time spent on Instagram, and that Instagram has been working with businesses to help them find their visual voice, so that the ads are high quality and effective.
