When a couple of terrorists attacked and killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Californiain December last year, an iPhone 5c was recovered, and its been in the news almost as much as the terror attack itself. The phone was said to contain pertinent information that the FBI really wanted their mitts on, and the Washington Post today reports that it wasable to, with the help of professional hackers using a security flaw in the iPhone that was previously unknown.We already knew that the FBI had successfully hacked the phone when it postponed and later abandoned a legal case against Apple to unlock the phone, but until now, it remained a mystery how it happened. According to the Washington Post,hackers were able to access the data on the phone by using a new security weakness in the iPhone, in what is called azero-day exploit. In this case, it appears that the exploit was specific to the iPhone 5c, and that the attack vector used to get the data from the phone wouldnt have worked on current-generation phones.The reason why this is such a big deal, is that a 4-digit pin on its own isnt much of a deterrent: There are only 10,000 different combinations. If youre able to try a combination every second, youre likely to have opened the phone in under three hours. Even if the hack delayed the process slightlyif it takes 30 seconds to enter a password, discover its the wrong one, reset the security measures and try again, it would still only take 3 days and 11 hours to try every possible combination.The hack enabled the FBI to apparently usea custom-fabricated piece of hardware to brute-force all the possible four-digit passwords, eventually finding the correct PIN, and then accessing the contents on the San Bernardino iPhone.TheFBI reportedly paid an unnamed independent security contractor an one-time fee for the information on the security exploit, which evidently was all it needed to crack the phone.
