PewDiePie is launching his own multi-channel network called Revelmode. You may remember that PewDiePie was part of Maker Studios, Disneys successful MCN. PewDiePie isnt really parting ways with Disney as PewDiePie is working with Maker Studios for this new MCN. Revelmode is an imprint of Maker Studios with Felix Kjellberg aka PewDiePie in charge.PewDiePie has the most popular YouTube channel with 41.6 million subscribers. He releases videos of himself playing video games every day. His reactions are the reasons why people keep coming back to his videos.That puts him in a very powerful position at Maker Studios. The company has no choice but to agree with PewDiePies vision. Revelmode will produce YouTube videos obviously, but also video games, merchandises and charity drives.PewDiePies friends are joining the network, such as CinnamonToastKen (Ken Morrison), CutiePieMarzia (Marzia Bisognin), Dodger (Brooke Lawson), EmmaBlackery (Emma Blackery), JackSepticEye (Sean McLoughlin), Jelly (Jelle van Vucht), Kwebbelkop (Jordi van den Bussche) and Markiplier (Mark Fischbach).You can expect one-off videos, original series featuring multiple YouTubers and more YouTubers joining the network. An animated series featuring PewDiePie is in the works.As you can see in the list of YouTubers, Revelmode wont be just about gaming. But its interesting to see that PewDiePie wants to be in charge of another side of the business and not just his own YouTube channel.Having a network can be useful when it comes to producing and editing videos, but the raison dtre of MCNs is advertising. Its much easier to book lucrative advertising deals when you can tell brands that you are managing YouTubers with millions of subscribers. Revelmode is off to a great start with around 75 million subscribers in total and billions of views.
