So maybe youve heard that deforestation is destroying 200 kilometers of the worlds forests each day. Obviously, that doesnt sound good. But visualize this data on a map of the world, and its much easierto understand why deforestation is a huge concern.This ability to communicate information through maps is what spurred Javier de la Torre, a conservation scientist by training, to launch mapping software startup CartoDB in 2012 after spending years researching endangered species.Today, CartoDB is announcing $23 million in new funding led by Accel Partners to bring its data visualization tools to individual and business users worldwide. Salesforce Ventures participated in the Series B round, along with existing investors Earlybird Ventures and Kibo Ventures, which brings the companysfunding total to $31 million.One of the most problematic things that we have in conservation is that the scientists cant explain the work theyre doing in a way thats effective for people to take decisions or understand the consequences, de la Torre says. Climate change is an incredible example, scientists are telling us that things are going one way but people still dont get it.With CartoDB, any user can upload their data and choose from a variety of suggested mapping templates to best visualize it. Earlier this year, the company launched One-Click Mapping, a feature that analyzes the data you upload and automatically creates maps showing the relevant information.A lot of people will look at their data for a particular thing, but they might be missing other insights, de la Torre says. By analyzing it on our own and displaying a number of possibilities, we see people saying Huh, I didnt know that was there.From real-time visualizationsof Americas Super Bowl tweets to a map of Los Angeles Countys homeless population, CartoDBs software has already been utilized to communicate a broad range of information.Although potentially less relevant to most of you, this map of nocturnal bird migration over the German-Polish border (whichalso accounts for time of sunset, wind intensity, and flight speed) shows just how sophisticated these vizzescan get.Currently, the company is working with over 1,000 paying customers ranging frombig banks to government departments in New York City, Mexico City, and Barcelona, among others  but anyone can create a free account toaccess the platforms basic features.The more businesses that dump their data into CartoDB, the smarter the companys mapping and data-processing algorithms will get. Ultimately, this means thataverage business users will be much better equipped to handle theirown data analysis.Just like nowadays theres no Excel department in a company because people know how to use it, were going to see the same thing happen with mapping and location intelligence, de la Torre says. We want to see a much bigger audience using this to empower a society thats able to make better decisions by themselves.
