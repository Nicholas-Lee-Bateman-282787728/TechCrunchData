Look what I found on Craigslist. This is the best deal ever. If you browse the antiques category, youll find an offer you cant refuse. For a mere $8 billion, you could buy Yahoo!A beautiful piece in good-to-fair condition, showing some signs of wear but easily restored in the hands of the right person, the listing says. Sadly, the original owners can no longer maintain it.Sounds like a good deal to me.Via: @film_girl
