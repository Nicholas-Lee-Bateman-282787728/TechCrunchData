Twitter has hired Jeffrey Siminoff to replace Janet Van Huysse as the companys new vice president of diversity and inclusion. The news was announced on, yep, Twitter, by its head of human resources,Brian Schipper.Siminoff, who starts in January, seems like a great fit for this role. Hes joining Twitter from Apple, where he was thedirector of worldwide inclusion and diversity from September 2013 up until now, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he led global diversity and inclusion efforts at Morgan Stanley for three years. Hes also one of the founding leaders of Out Leadership, a global LGBT leadership organization.OL congratulates @Twitter & 1 of our Founding #OutLeaders @jmsSanFran! Huge #lgbtprogress!!#diversity @TwitterOpen https://t.co/IsUoNGewLC Out Leadership (@OutLeadership) December 28, 2015A new diversity boss couldbe good for Twitter, which has had pretty badyear around diversity and inclusion. Though,some people areraising their eyebrows around Siminoffs hire because hes a white man. Butdiversity is not simply a matter of black versus white. True diversity includes a variety of people ofdifferent racial backgrounds, genders, sexualities and socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as people with disabilities and/or veterans. Personally, Im not fazed by the fact that Siminoff is white because people of color should not have to be the only ones advocating for diversity and inclusion, just how women should not have to be the only ones advocating for feminism.Van Huysse, Twitters departing VP of diversity and inclusion who spent six years at Twitter, didnt say what shes doing next, butwroteon Twitter that its time for her next chapter.I reached out to Twitter andthe company said it has nothing to add.
