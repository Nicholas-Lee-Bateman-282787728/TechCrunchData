Back in September 2007 I attended a startup pitch event held in a London university lecture theatre. The surroundings werent plush. The slightly musty lecture theatre didnt hint at the ambitions of the people present. But when Niklas Zennstrom, co-founder of Skype walked in, and joined in a panel of other seasoned tech entrepreneurs, everyone knew something important was happening.What we saw of course, was the birth of Seedcamp, the first truly pan-European accelerator which went on to become a dedicated early-stage fund. Eight years on, its now releasing an updated portfolio analysis, on the occasion of passing 200 invested companies.Of the 206 companies its so far invested in, 149 of them are still operational, 45 ended up shutting down and its had 12 exits of one sort or another. Thus its failure rate is less than 25%, a decent figure for most investors. Its companies have raised a total of $365M in funding, with the pace of investing speeding up. The last two years saw it invest in 95 startups.Co-founded by Reshma Sohoni and Saul Klein, and now led by Sohoni and Partner Carlos Espinal, Seedcamp held multiple events across Europe to network Founders, Investors and Mentors. And the pace was, in those early years, blistering. Although I went on a few of their trips, their programme was intense.The largest sector its now invested in is FinTech, with investments such as Transferwise, Revolut, Curve and Monese. And a 20M seed fund launching in mid-2014 now has 29 companies in its portfolio.Sohoni said: Seedcamp was born out of a need to connect the best parts of the European tech ecosystem to build businesses that could be world-class. Since we launched, the tech scene has changed dramatically. We have multiple tech hubs that are creating multi-billion dollar businesses. We have an influx of capital, particularly in London, with sizeable capital available that you didnt see in 2007.Carlos Espinal, Partner at Seedcamp, added: Weve always been sector agnostic when considering companies for investment, but there are waves of innovation that emerge, and we do our best to get ahead of them and invest early. For example, 15 per cent of our portfolio is FinTech, a growing and exciting space in Europe, and recently weve made more investments into PropTech which now makes up 7 per cent of our companies. Its also invested in blockchain, cyber security and artificial intelligence.Other data points include: 84 per cent of Seedcamp backed companies have received further funding.Number of investments per year: 2007  6, 2008  7, 2009  9, 2010  14, 2011  19, 2012  28, 2013  28, 2014  35 (7 were Seed), 2015  60 (22 were Seed).
