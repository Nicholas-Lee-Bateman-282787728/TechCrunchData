Here come the GIFs. We noticed Twitter testing an in-app GIF button on Android a few weeks ago, and now the company has formally announced that it is turning the feature on for all users.The test seemed to go pretty well based on the number of GIF tweets from users in the trialso afull launch is no surprise at all. Twitter said that GIF Search  which it is calling the button  will become available to iOS, Android and Twitter.com users over the coming weeks. The button will work for composing publictweets and sending DMs, too, the company added.The search feature is powered byGiphy and Riffsy, two of the biggest repositories of GIFs on the Internet  and the same two companies that are behind the GIF search feature in Facebook Messenger. Like Messenger,you can chooseGIFs on Twitter using a range of pre-selected categories  like awesome, agree, dance  or by searching for specific terms.Twitter said that its users shared over 100 million GIFs last year. That figure was no doubt helped by the fact that GIFs (and videos) autoplay inside users timelines, but making it super simple to find them is sure to supercharge that trend  good job theres a mute button for anyone who takes this new feature too far.
