Todd Breeden is a venture investor and financial adviser to early-stage companies in New York. To mostentrepreneurs,the road to venture capital financing is littered with criticismand rejection. Ranging from limited traction to thats a hard space, VCshave an entire vocabulary of terms to pass on investments  and can sometimes even forgo that vocabulary with the soft no by ghosting the founder.Once a founder inevitably gets a VC firm on the hook,it is only natural that they think theyneedto not rock the boat and close the round. However,financing is a partnership withyourVC, and it often establishes a board member foryourbusiness foryears to come. All too often, companies fail to do their own due diligence on theirVCsbefore entering into this agreement.Sowhat doyouneedtoknowaboutyourVC when reviewing their term sheet?After a venture capital fund has been soldand is closed to new limited partners, the firm will typically invest out of this vehicle over a three-five year windowbefore beginning the fundraising process again.Beware the VC nearing the end of their fund cycle, as they may become more disengaged withyourcompany, or they may not have the necessary capital available to call to invest in your company over its lifetime.Too manyentrepreneursstop questioning the track record of their investor after mention of a handful of logos.Only 7 percentof investments in unicorns have ultimately returnedthe entire fund that invested in them,meaningodds are high that the VC touting their early investment in ___ may not have made the returnyouassume they made.Understanding the portfolios overall performance on a cash-on-cash basis andrelative to their peer groups will giveyouan idea if they knowwhat theyre talking about, and how well future fundraising efforts will go.Beware the VC with unrealized returns and looking to fundraise as theytry to pushyouto sellyourcompany earlier thanyouwould like.Many VC firms simply price the value of their positions to the most recent valuation of the company, but othersmark to financial performance (using public comps or recent exitsas a benchmark),or even based on internal projections.Inknowing howyourVC accounts for their position inyourcompany,youcan gain a greater understanding for their incentives onyourboard. Boards can become challenging during times of distress, when some ofyourboard members have markedyourinvestment down while others continue to hold it at cost.Beware the VC that aggressively marks up their portfolio, as they may be difficult to manage in times of distress.VC firms typically run extremely lean, andthere is a limited availability of positions and an oversupply of eager talent looking to enter the industry.While many firms churn and burn junior employees in two-three year pre-MBA roles,otherstreat theirassociates as partner-track members of the team and their departure should be seen as aredflag, as it likely is a signal of the funds downward trajectory or the quality of the partner team.Beware the VC that has had any general partners leave the firm.Obviously,youre not going to learnyourVCs most intimate operational detail in the first or second meeting, butonce youve got a term sheet in hand, these are important questions to have answered prior to entering a long-term partnership.Beware the VC that denies this level of transparency.
