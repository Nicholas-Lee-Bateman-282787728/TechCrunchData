And then there were three. Earlier this week, Microsoft released a new set of updates for Windows 10 for the third time since the operating system formally debuted in late July. Windows 10 is Microsofts attempt to build a single operating system that can function on devices of any size, or input variety.As before, the update comes with minimal documentation and explanation. And, again, akin to previous instances, the updated code comes with a completely useful set of notes:Jokes aside, the new update contains all prior cumulative updates, so if you missed round one, or two, this should get you up to speed.On that point we have to take a pause. Heres Microsofts official words on the update:Windows 10 updates are cumulative. Therefore, this package contains all previously released fixes. If you have previous updates installed, only the new fixes that are contained in this package will be downloaded and installed to your computer.Therefore, Microsoft will continue to release cumulative updates. And, in that vein, I presume that the firm will shift the packages as it updates the code it initially distributes via upgrades, and OEM partners; it wont need to send out July 2015 updates forever, since, presumably, that code will eventually become standard fare. For now, you get regular doses of new, and old.And for fair play, these update packages are more background fixes than new features. So that Microsoft isnt saying much should fail tosurprise.
