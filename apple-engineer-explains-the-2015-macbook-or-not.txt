The new MacBook has been lets say, divisive. Even within TechCrunch, weve got one side suggesting its a betrayal while the other declares it nothing short of the future.But theres one thing we can all agree on: oh man, this parody video is fantastic.Watch on, as an Apple Engineer explains the design process of the 2015 MacBook:Its even better if your high school Spanish is juuuust rusty enough to pluck out some of the words, but not good enough that youre distracted by the actual story. Every once in a while, the subtitles and the actual words being said match up a little and everything just falls into place.For the curious: a friend tells me the man in the video is actually telling a story about trying to wash a paella pan in the ocean, only to have the tides roll away with his pan.(But seriously though, one port?)
