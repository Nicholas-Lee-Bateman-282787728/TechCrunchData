The thesis behind Teleport, a new Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup from a group of early Skypealums, is that workers shouldbe free to migrate to whichever city and country suits them best.Theyve been slowly building out a suite of tools that help digital workers figure out where they can maximizetheir take-home pay after accounting forcosts like housing and findingamenities that matcha personspreferences for quality of life.Now theyre aiming at startups with teams distributed across the world with a new tool called Flock.The concept isnt very complicated.Just enter in where all of your team members are based and it will identify themost convenient and affordable place to have a face-to-face meeting.Teleport is betting that an increasing number of companiesare beginning withdistributed teams from day one. Asthe cost ofhousing and office space inareas like Silicon Valley rises, it may notreally make sense for founders to base their entire team here, especially if prospective hires have talent networks, families or communities elsewhere in the world.While there are older companies like WordPress that have built entire systems and a corporate culture arounddistributed and remote teams,younger companies are starting to take heed as well.
