Near a week after being silenced because the internet taught her to be racist,Microsofts artificial intelligence bot Tay briefly returned to Twitter today, whereon she went on a spam tirade and then quickly fell silent again.Tay was created bythe Microsoft Technology and Research and Bing teamsin an effort to conduct research on conversational understanding, and was billed as being capable of learning from interactions with people. The internet being the internet, Tay was schooled on a lot of inappropriate stuff, to the point that Microsoft thought it best to put her to sleep for a while so it could make adjustments.Well, post-lobotomy Tay seemed to have a problem keeping up with the pace of herself.The Twitter account filledthe timelines of her215,000 followers with as many as seven tweets per second during a 10-minute spell. In doing so, some of her messagesmayhavecreated a new Twitter meme: You are too fast, please take a restTheres a credible suggestion that the account may have been hacked.We asked Microsoft for more details but a spokespersondeclined to comment beyond a recent blog post.Microsoft seeminglysaw this outburst, and it promptly quietened Tay once again and set the AIs Twitter account to private  meaning that it cant add new Twitter followers unless they are approved. That also prevents us fromembedding the tweets, but here are some additional screenshots.This feels like how the AI apocalypse starts
