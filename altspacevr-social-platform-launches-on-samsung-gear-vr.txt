Virtual reality can sometimes appear like its a prettyisolating platform. Visually, people experiencing VR certainly arent in the most approachable position and right now the tech is new enough thatit rarely seems accessible to those who are vaguely curious.That being said, there are plenty ofcompanies succeeding in strengthening the social potential ofVR. One of the coolest companies doing so, AltspaceVR, just became even more accessible today as it launched its mobile experience on Samsung Gear VR.While we wait for the future, what users can do now in theAltspaceVR app is still a lot offun. The app containsseveral virtual spaces that multiple users can meet in to play board game-style games, compete in quiz shows or do something less active like watch some YouTube videos together or share content from the built-in web browser. Users can do all of this while navigating these spaces and having real conversations with friends.Our focus at AltspaceVR is creating the most natural and fulfilling communication experience possible online, and were thrilled to bring it to Gear VR, said AltspaceVR Founder and CEO Eric Romo in a statement. AltspaceVR on Gear VR brings nearly all the features of our PC experience, but with the ease of use of mobile.Moving forward, the companyis really looking at what specific events and games make sense for people to collaborate on. Mobile VR users can feelsomewhat limited bythe differences in input precision on the Gear VR versus desktop controls, but this canonly improveas mobile VR platforms like Samsung begin experimenting with more-effectiveinput methods.One thing thats interestinghere is this trend that AltspaceVR is fitting into where VR developers are sort of dialing back and working to create cross-platform experiences that dont have to beas resource-straining as desktop-optimized apps but are able to reach greater audiences thanks to the greater accessibility of mobile VR. Samsung Gear VR has proven to be a really stellar first go at mobile VR and it will be interesting to see what comes next as mobile companies start to nail down key featureslike positional tracking and eye tracking.AltspaceVR is in a really cool place right now because theyrecapturing the VR social space and making it available across major platforms. As more and more people are drawn in by the attractive experiences of mobile VR, AltspaceVR will undoubtedly serve as one of the companies thatuniteshigh-end VR users and novices in a way that strengthens the VRplatform in general.
