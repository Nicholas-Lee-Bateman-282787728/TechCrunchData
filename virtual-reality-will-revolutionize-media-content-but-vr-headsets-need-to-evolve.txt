Virtual reality can deliver on its promise to bringnew and immersive experiences to the masses, but the current iteration of hardware will need to evolve first.Thats the view shared by NextVR co-founderDave Cole and Shanna Tellerman, co-founder and CEO ofModsy,two VR industry veterans who took to the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt NYto dig intothe development of this much-hyped but potentially transformative medium.Tellermanscompany, which raised $8 million in February,enablesusers to create a fully virtualversion of their home for the purpose of testing out interior design styles or decor. Thats quite unlike the typical content associated with VR  such as games, sports or even pornography  and Tellerman believes it will take some timeforVR to permeate beyond the typicallywhite male users whoown early versions of the hardware right now.The reality is that most consumers who [could benefit the most]dont have VR in their living room yet. We have incredible technology in the background, and were designing every home so that, when VR hits, we can take advantage of it, she said.NextVR, which recently closed a$30.5 million Series A round,has struck deals with LiveNationand already covers a range of sports, including the Kentucky Derby and select NBA matches. Plenty of new features are in the pipeline, including positional tracking and movement,but Coleadmitted he wants to expand his companys range of programming.Content for a broader audience is a tricky issue, [were focused on] very pronounced silos right now. Ittakes critical mass, you have to hang that [content push]on [VR reaching a] critical mass, he explained.But, for those that experience it, there will be no turning back.Once youve had that experience, anything else will feel like watching video in a fish bowl, Cole added.So what will it take for virtual reality to reach critical mass?Aside from time, Tellerman and Cole both believe a new kind of hardware experience is needed. Fixed-home VR is showing the potential for the virtual reality and augmented reality content experience, but it is costly,unwieldy and uncomfortable. Thats kept it to a limited early demographic.Were all very hesitant to put things on our face.The trend needs to start with trendy people starting it in Silicon Valley maybe sometimes works, Tellerman joked. Form factor needs to be something that hits the mark.Form factors will need to change before it becomes mainstream, Cole said in agreement.The NextVR founder sharedhis beliefthat LGs lightweight VR headset,LG 360 VR (a prototype of which was announced earlier this year), is the type of device that can move virtual reality intonew kinds of audiences beyond early adopters. He also mentioned Microsofts HoloLens, which has shown early promise and has more than 1,000 engineers working on its development.Ithink theres a step beyond [headsets], whether its in our phone or our eyes, it wont be a set of goggles sitting in our home, Tellerman mused.Both executives believe that VR is poised to be a genuine breakthrough, and not fall dead on its hype like 3D TV did.3DTV was a very small value add to the television experience, said Cole, whose company was involved in TV, he explained.VR engages your entire visual system in a way that 3D never did, [it is] immersive beyond anything that was possible even an iMaxtheater.3Dgoggles might [fail], but VRcontent creates a different level of immersion, it feels like were creating amazing businesses, Tellerman said in agreement.
