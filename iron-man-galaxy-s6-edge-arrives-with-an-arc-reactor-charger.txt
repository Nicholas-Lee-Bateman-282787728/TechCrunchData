Samsungs Iron Man-branded Galaxy S6 Edge arrives tomorrow, with a custom paint job, 64GB of on-board storage and a limited edition wireless charger accessory with an appropriate arc reactor graphic included on top. It ships with a clear cover, too, so you can protect your precious armor when ticketing around in the real world.The box it comes in is also red and gold, and theres a big ol Iron Man helmet stencil graphic on the back of the device, too, as well as a software theme to match. I probably wouldveleft offthe face personally, letting the colors speak for themselves, but this was a partnership with Marvel with the intent of promoting the new Avengers film oversees, so they probably couldve been a lot less tasteful with the branding overall.The sad news for those of you who were hoping to advertise their Stark fandom on their phones is that availability is listed as only Korea as of tomorrow, with sales beginning in China and Hong Kong in late June. Theres no U.S. date even mentioned, so you might have to plan a trip or watch the secondary market if youre hoping to get this particular device finish. For now, you can at least watch Samsung unbox its own device in the video above.
