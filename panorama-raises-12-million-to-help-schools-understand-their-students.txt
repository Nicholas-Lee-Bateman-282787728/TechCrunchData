Panorama Education, a startup that surveys students, parents and teachers to collect actionable data, has raised $12 million in new funding to help school districts make better decisions.Spark Capital and Owl Ventures led the Series A round.Panoramas seedinvestors includeY Combinator, Google Ventures, and Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chans Startup:Education.Panorama was started in 2013 by two Yale undergraduate students, Aaron Feuer and Xan Tanner, who wanted to figure out the best way for schools to collect and understand feedback from their students.Theres all this talk about data and education, but data has really been a buzzwordand not verymeaningful because were still looking at test scores, not at how engaged students are, says Feuer. Theres a disconnect between the things we care about and the things that were actually measuring and judging schools by.Schools are required to track a standard set of data by law, including test scores, grades, and attendance records. Panorama uses this existing data as a baseline for the surveys it runs.When a district signs up, the schools select five specific areas that theyd like to know more about. Students, for instance, will be asked questions to determine how safe they feel at school, how much they trust their teachers, and how much potential they think they have.Right now schoolstrack dropout rates, for instance, but its not helpful to find out after the student has dropped out, says Feuer. Schools want to know if students and teachers have close relationships, because that prevents many students from dropping out.On the other hand, top-performing schools want to demonstratethat their students are well-rounded beyond their test scores, which is especially helpful forhiring top teachers.In order to collect information from a wide variety of schools, Panorama tailors its survey methodto fit each one. While polling by email works well for schools in wealthier areas, many districts in the U.S. are still using paper forms as their primary form of communicationwith students and parents.The companyis currently working with thousands of schools across 220 districts and 40 states that collectively enroll more than three million students. Fourteen of Americas top 100 largest school districts  including San Francisco Unified, Seattle Public Schools, and Dallas Independent  have adopted Panorama, along with most major charter networks.I think VCs historically have been somewhat scared of the edtechsales model, butthats one of the shining points of Panorama, says Andrew Parker of Spark Capital. Theyve gained a ton of traction in schools by selling through districts.Considering that the New York City Department of Education  the countrys largest school district with nearly 1 million kids enrolled  spends more than $20,000 per student, its clear how important it is for schools to be making informed spending decisions. In many cases, the problem isnt necessarily a lack of funding, but how schools are choosing to allocatefunding.Spending is the Holy Grail of impact here, but theres not a whole, well-developed playbook for what actions you take to solve the problems that get diagnosed in education, says Feuer.Why is it that schools are still struggling no matter where you go, and throwing an extra $12k per student at the school is not making it better?As more districts usePanorama to not only identify issues, butreport the results ofdifferent strategies to solve them, the company will be able to effectively prescribesolutions for a broad range of educational problems.
