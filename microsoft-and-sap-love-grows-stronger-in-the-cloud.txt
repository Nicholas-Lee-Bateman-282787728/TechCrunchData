Microsoft and SAP have been pals for years and years, and today at the SAP Sapphire Now customer conference in Orlando, the two company CEOs, Satya Nadella and Bill McDermott announced they weretaking the relationshipto another levelwithdeeper cloud integrations between the two companies.The deal will enable SAP customers to run HANA, the companys in-memory database product on Microsofts Azure cloud.The two companies announced a deal a couple of years agoto allow customers to build HANA applications, taking advantage of theelastic resources which Azure (and indeed any cloud) provides, but this announcement takes thatanother step, enabling customers toaccessAzure security and management capabilities that have been beefed up since that previous agreement was announced.HANA also runs on AWS, but Microsoft was careful to differentiate the two with Azure offering the ability to handle larger amounts of data and RAM, which can come in handy when youre processing bigdata loads.In addition, there will be a more extensive link between SAP products such as Concur, SuccessFactors and Ariba and Office 365 to bring communications, collaboration, calendaring and all of the tools in Office 365 more directly into the SAP tool set and vice versa.Concur travel info automatically shows up in this Outlook calendar entry in Office 365.The deal makes a lot of sense given that the two companies both have deep ties to the enterprise and share a common set of large customers with similar needs. It allows themto each play to their strengths without really competing with one another.The announcement comes on the heels of SAPsdeal with Applethatthe companytrumpeted just a couple of weeks ago to bring iOS to SAP customers. It also shows a concerted effort on SAPs part to expand itsmarketreach using partnerships as leverage, R Ray Wang, principal at Constellation Research told TechCrunch.SAPs been changing their strategy around partnerships. theyve taken the time to see what customers are interested in and are building out partnerships that align back to customers install base and business requirements, Wang explained.For Microsoft, its about a platform play. Meanwhile, we are also seeing a renewed Microsoft focused on platforms. Satya wants to be the neutral provider to as many business application vendors as possible, he said.This partnership provides another way to bring two companiescloser togetherthat already have a long history.The products and capabilities announced today will be available some time in the third quarter of this year.
