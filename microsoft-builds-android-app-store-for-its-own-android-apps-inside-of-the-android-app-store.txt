Microsoft has a new app out called Microsoft Apps on Android that contains a list of its Android apps that you can download on the Android app store.There are two parts to this development. The first is that Microsofts cross-platform work continues, and that the company has yet to let up an inch on its work to bring its software and services to users on every rivaloperating system. And, the second point is that Microsoft has created an effective Android app store  catalog?  inside of the actual Android app store.An early comment noted that fact. From the apps page on Google Play:That comment is almost correct. At the same time, it can be difficult to sort through tens, and hundreds of thousands of apps to find the precise one that you are perhaps looking for. Microsoft wants to make sure that if you want to use its stack on Android, you can do so without unnecessary sleuthing.The app has racked up four review so far, giving it an average score of 4 stars.The new app might not make sense until you realize just how many apps Microsoft has on Android  you can take a spin through the full list here. Its extensive. Its almost odd to recall how big a splash bringing Office to Android and iOS once was.Microsoft fans have a new toy, and the company has a potential conduit for its apps on the Android platform. Not too bad a turn of events for the Redmond-based software company.
