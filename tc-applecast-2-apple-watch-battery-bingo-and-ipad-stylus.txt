On the second ever TechCrunch AppleCast, Darrell Etherington and Kyle Russell discuss the Apple Watch and its battery life, as potentially revealed by leaks this week. We also touch on analyst reports claiming that a 12.9-inch iPad will also include an Apple-made stylus accessory option, and dive into a closer look at Copyfeed, a handy iOS utility. Finally, we preview the week to come, which includes an Apple quarterly earnings report that is almost guaranteed to blow us away.Regarding Apple Watch battery life, the question is whether, if the details are as reported, the wearable will offer enough to satisfy consumers, or whether it might turn some away as argued by some including Business Insiders Steve Kovach. We also look at some early third-party estimates for iPhone shipments leading into next weeks official financial report, most of which predict a huge quarter.Feedback via email is appreciated, as always, and be sure to also rate the podcast on iTunes if thats one of the ways in which you listen.Direct download available here, or find us on iTunes and SoundCloud.
