Editors Note: Christine Magee is an editorfor CrunchBase.In a recovering economy wherebig banks are restricted bycomplex regulations, startups and venture investors are gearing upfor the nextgold rush in the trillion-dollar marketplace lending industry. Thats trillion. With a T.BigIPOs for Lending Cluband OnDeck(valued at $9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively) appeartohave spurred afunding frenzy this year as venture investors digfor more pay dirt.In the first two months of 2015, VCs committed $340 million in venture capital for lending tech startups, according to CrunchBase data.The 17 deals recorded in 2015 average $23 million each, compared to a $14 million average deal size in 2014.Peer-to-peer lenders Lending Club and Prosperset the stage for the lending marketplace boom, butthe latestgeneration of lending tech is all aboutverticals.Student loan marketplaceSoFis $200 million monster round in January, led by Third Point, is the largest round trackedto date. AndDriverUp, alending platformfor automotive financing, announced a $50 million Series A last week from Emerald Development Managers andRRE Ventures.The reason these alternative lending platforms are coming up is thatplatform lending is simply more efficient for both the borrower and the lender, says Stuart Ellman, managing partner at RRE.The borrower is able to find loans that they otherwise werent able to get  either fromthe banking crisis or frombanks tightening up their lending process  and lenders have the ability to do their diligence, see the risk and the interest rates, and make the loans they want to on an a la carte basis, Ellman says.The marketplace model has been proven, and now entrepreneurs aretweaking it to fitallindustries.DriverUp is the first to bringmarketplace techtothe$400 billion automotive lending market, which CEOSam Ellissays hasoperated in a very traditional mode for the past 30 years.Auto loans as an asset class  different than real estate, gold, treasuries, bonds and stocks  historically have performed well and held up well through the recession, says Ellis. If youre a high net worth individual or some sort of investment fund, you want options and you want attractive risk-adjusted returns.The economy may have recovered, butthe 2008meltdown is still taking a toll onthe lending market. Investors are more concernedthan ever about where their money is going and how their investments will fare in anothereconomic downturn.People are learning that post-recession, post-financial crisis, they want more dataand more transparency about what theyre investing in, and the marketplace platform allows investors to do their own analysis, says Ellis.DriverUp is just one of the venture-backed startups to apply the marketplace modelto a specific vertical. Companies likeRealtyMogulin the$2 trillion real estate industry andNoesisin the $18 billioncommercial energy equipmentmarket have seen rapid growth despitea narrow focus.Unlike some industries, where if youre starting to go after certain verticals maybe youre a little too niche, in this industry, youre talking about massive markets that are still able to be disrupted, saysDan Ciporin,partner at Canaan Partners andLending Club board member.As alternative lending becomes more popular, shiftingcapitalto lending marketplaces gets especially tricky for institutional investors. Manyfirms have come to relyonenabling technologies to expedite the process.As soon as you start talking to operations or accounting teams, you realize that the thought of trying to track $100 million worth of $8,000 loans is just terrifying  none of their systems are set up to deal with loans that small,explains Matt Burton, founder of Orchard.Orchard, a Canaan portfolio company, launched last year to simplifyonline direct lending at scale, andcurrentlypowers seven investment platforms, including Lending Club, Prosper, and OnDeck. Burton says there are 450 more currently on their waitlist.This is an area thats going to continue to see a lot of innovation and disruption for the next few years minimum, if not the next 20 years, says Ciporin. Youll see things start to happen around the ecosystem thats being created, and thats what I think is really exciting  that there is an ecosystem now and its getting to be very large.
