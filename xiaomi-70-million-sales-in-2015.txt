Chinas Xiaomi has finally revealed how many smartphones in sold last year. Kinda. The company said in a statement today that it sold over 70 million devices in 2015. Thats a 15 percent jump on the61 million sales it logged for 2014, but it is shortof the 80 million projection it set for 2015  which was reduced from an initial 100 million target.Xiaomihas beenunder pressure from media for slowing sales growth, with its $45 billion valuation coming intoquestion.The company seemed to feed into negativity that when it bucked its usual New Year tradition by not releasing sales figures forthe previous twelve months until now.We asked Xiaomifor an exact figure but itdeclined to provide one. A representative also told us that Xiaomi would not break sales out by region, so we cant be sure how many phones it sold in China, and how it is performing inemerging markets like India, Indonesia and Brazil  where demand is promising but theres plenty of competition in the sub-$300 phone bracket.Analysts are generally agreed that fellow Chinese phone maker Huawei eclipsed Xiaomi in terms of performance in 2015.The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Huawei became the first Chinese company to shipmore than 100 million smartphones in a single year, thanks to impressive 44 percent shipment growth.Late last year,analyst firm Canalys went so far as to reportthat Huawei overtook Xiaomi as Chinas top smartphone seller in the thirdquarter of 2015, and theres a growing feel that Xiaomisonline sales model has been duplicated by the competition, taking one important factor it had on its rivalsaway from it. Likewise, Xiaomis services business  long seen as a potential money-making organ  has yet to kick in and show signs of delivering on its potential.Nonetheless, Xiaomi todayclaimed that it, not Huawei, was the top smartphone manufacturer in China in terms of market share for the year of 2015.Even though Huawei won in terms of shipments, its quite possible Xiaomi topped its rival in China. For one thing, Huawei discloses shipments (to retailers) and Xiaomi deals in sales to end-users, both companies figures are global (Huawei made a big U.S. push last year) not China specific, and Xiaomi led Huawei in China according to analyst reports for the first half of 2015.But the rivalry is really a distraction from the main point: the development of Xiaomis business.At the end of the day, Xiaomis sales are still risingbut it has reached a level of relative maturity and its closest rivals have upped their game too. The big question for 2016 is whether Xiaomihas enough in its locker to justify its colossal valuation, or whether it mayto readjust its goals and expectations.
