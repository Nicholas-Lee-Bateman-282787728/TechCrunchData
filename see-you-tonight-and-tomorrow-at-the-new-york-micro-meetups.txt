Its that time of month again: micro meetup time. Im holding two small meetups in Manhattan and Brooklyn: a mini pitch-off on Wednesday, January 13, 2016 and a BTC event on Thursday, January 14, 2016. These are informal affairs and to get the NYC startup world together in one place and eat pizza.You can RSVP here for the pitch-off and here for the BTC meetup. Attend one or both or neither.The Manhattan event is at Knotel on 33 West 17th Street and the BTC event is being held at Coinspace in Industry City. Both are rollicking good times and well worth the price of the free admission. See you there!
