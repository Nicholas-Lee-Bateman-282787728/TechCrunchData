Next time you open the YouTube app on your iOS or Android phone, youll be greeted by a new homepage experience.Before, YouTube would show youa list of recommended items with small thumbnails, followed by a few more lists of recommended videos about topics youve recently shown interested in. Now, youll see a single feed of recommended videos that are all presented with large thumbnails (so large that youll only see maybe two recommended videos on even a large a phone without scrolling). With this, the design of the home feed now pretty much looks exactly like the one you can already find in YouTubes trending tab.YouTubes VP of product management Johanna Wright tells me that the company tested this single ranked list, which is driven by an improved recommendations algorithm, with a small group of users over the last few weeks and they typically watched more videos and stayed with them for longer.Wright notes that Googles improved recommendationsalgorithm, which uses deep neural networks at its core,is now also able to recommend fresher content, including videos uploaded within the last hour.We want YouTube to communicate this feeling that it understands you, Wright said. So while you may see slightly fewer recommended videos in the mobile app now, those videos will (hopefully) be more relevant to you. The system will also keep adding recent videos from channels you have subscribed to as well, so itll be interesting to see what (if any) effect this change will have on YouTube Creators.
