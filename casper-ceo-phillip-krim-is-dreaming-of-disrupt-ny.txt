Though Casper prides itself on making sure you catch some Zzzs, Casper CEO Phillip Krim wont be inducing any snoring come Disrupt NY in May. His company is company is targeting an industry that most consumers consider a night terror. Maybe well even get him to do the interview lying in a Casper mattress. Anything could happen. Its Disrupt!Casper is flipping over the mattress industry by offering a direct-to-consumer product that is rapidly changing the way people shop for not just mattresses, but furniture.The industry, which aims to give people sweet dreams but most often nightmares, thrives by severely marking up products and assuming little to no risk by not carrying inventory. But Casper thinks its not fair for you to pay twice as much for your mattress, and offers all the standard sizes for around half of the price youd pay in a traditional retail outlet.Users can sleep on it and send back the mattress if they dont like it, and Casper handles all the packaging and shipping so that its easy to get in and out of your apartment or home. The whole process is a dream come true.Casper has raised a total of $15 million across two rounds, and has paved the way for direct competitors like Tuft & Needle, as well as similar companies like Hem and Interior Define, to explore the way customers feel about making big home purchases online.We cant wait to learn more about it from him in May at Disrupt NY.Dennis Crowley will join other notable Disrupt NY speakers, including TindersSean Rad, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, and Vines Jason Mante.The show runs May 4-6 at the historic Manhattan Center. Tickets are still available.Our sponsors help make Disrupt happen. If you are interested in learning more about sponsorship opportunities, please contact sponsors@techcrunch.com.
