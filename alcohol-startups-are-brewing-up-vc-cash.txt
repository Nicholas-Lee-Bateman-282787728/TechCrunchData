Editors Note: Christine Magee is an editorfor CrunchBase.A new startup movement brewing in the booze biz hasVCs backingliquordelivery services, roboticbartenders, andsmartphone breathalyzers and theyreshowing no sign of turning off the tap.Last year, startups in the alcohol industry raised$100 million in funding across 43 venture rounds. This is petty cashcompared to the $800 million raised by food startups in 2015 (Delivery Heros$586 million roundalonefar exceeds the total venture money invested in alcohol startups), but ahandful ofinvestors are convincedthat the alcohol industry warrantsits own tech brands. And theyre testing the waters with some early stage capital.Wine in the U.S. alone is $35 billion annually, liquor is something like $46 billion annually, and the higher margins on alcohol make this a compelling market,says Henry McNamara of Great Oaks Venture Capital.In the past year, Great Oaks has backed alcohol delivery startup Minibar and wine discovery app Drync. McNamara says the light tech layer that both are building requires very little capital but has a huge potential to transform consumer behavior.Theres a huge opportunity with on-demand in this industry because the large majority of alcohol is consumed within 24 hours of purchase  but right now, less than 2 percent of sales is being done online, says Lara Crystal, co-founder of Minibar.Consumers are increasingly expectant of on-demand service, whether for food, laundry, or ride hailing  so its logical that buying booze should followsuit. The legal restrictionsaround alcohol could explain why we dont already have a Seamless equivalent for liquor delivery,but startups are finding ways to circumvent the red tape.Crystals Minibar, for instance, the New York-based startup that acquired competitor Booze Carriage last week, powers product search, delivery, and customer service for its users  but since Minibar is not the merchant on record, theyre able to avoid the liabilitythat comes with selling liquor.Its obvioushow the customer benefits in this equation  who wants to run to the liquor store when an app can tell you exactly what they have in stock and bring it to your doorstep?  but local vendors and large brands stand to benefit on a widerscale.Americans spend over $104 billion annually on home consumption of alcohol, but less than 10% of alcohol retailers are online, says Anu Duggal, founder of Female Founders Fund and Minibar investor.The small proportion oflocal vendors thathave moved online are reportingencouragingresults. Duggal says that alcohol stores working with on-demand services have seen a significant uptick in sales  up to 50% for some.The real power of these platforms is the data analytics and marketing side  that has huge value for liquor or wine companies that are looking for new ways to attract new customers, saysMcNamara.Since launching in New York February of last year, Minibar has expanded to 7 major metro areas in the U.S., including San Francisco and Miami. And theyre not alone Boston-based Drizly has racked up nearly $5 million in VC funding in the past two years, and Thirstie, another NYC-based delivery startup, picked up $1.1 million in new funding last week.Its always encouraging when you see a market being built and validated by other VCs, says McNamara. Its still early days  I think well see lot of consolidation in the space and itll be interesting to see how it plays out.
