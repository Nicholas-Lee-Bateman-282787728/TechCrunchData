China is widely suspected to be behind the recent attacks on Github and internet freedom group Great Fire. Now we have the most concrete evidence that indeed it was, and it looks like it did so using a new weaponto boot.Thats according to a report from Citizen Lab an ICT, security and human rights lab based within the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. Citizen Lab looked into these recent attacks andidentified Great Cannon, a tool builttointercept data and redirect it to specific sites, as the attack systemresponsible for them.The recent attacks are the first instances of the Great Cannon being deployed, and they are notable for a fewreasons. Scale is one of them:Great Fire claimed millions of userswerecompromised for the attack it suffered, which hijacked Baiduand pushed the organizations Amazon hosting billto $30,000 per day. It is also persistent:Github said it faced the largest attack in its history,which was ongoing for five days.The Citizen Lab report surfaced evidence showingcommonalities between Chinas Great Firewall censorship system and Great Cannon. Thats another indicator that China was behind these malicious attacks  something it denies  but there is also concern that Chinas new internet weapon could be used for more specific and targeted attacks.The Edward Snowden leaks revealed the existence ofQUANTUM, anNSA tool that could plant malware on millions of computers.Citizen Lab said that, with slight moderations, Chinas Great Cannon could act in a similar way:A technically simple change in the Great Cannons configuration, switching to operating on traffic from a specific IP address rather than to a specific address, would allow its operator to deliver malware to targeted individuals who communicates with any Chinese server not employing cryptographic protections.The discovery of this tool is another reminder of the importance of secure browsing technology, like HTTPS, sinceweak security systems can undermine the safety of internet users browsing websites.Furthermore, with the tool now exposed to the world, what were Chinas motives for using it in such a public way?It could be that it was meant asa warning to other sites that challenge its censorship and regime so directly,but, either way, it representsa worrying change in policy from defensively censoring websites in China to proactively bringing them down.
