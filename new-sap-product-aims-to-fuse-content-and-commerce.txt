Its often said that content is king, but ina typical marketing department you have a hodgepodge of content. That could includecarefully-crafted web copy, blog entries and FAQs along withuser-generated ratings and reviews. For many companies, at least some of this content is spread out across the site without any real connection between the product pages and the content that supports it.SAP has a theory that spreading all of this content asundermakes it rather difficult for consumers to make informed decisions about their purchases  and this goes for any type of sale, whether a consumer device like a camera or something more complex like an enterprise technology purchase.Thats why the company came out with a new product today at theHybris customer conference,called SAP Jam Communities, Edition for SAP Hybris Commerce. The lack of poetry in the name notwithstanding, this product is designed to help companies create a more coherent link between all of the content related to the product and the product itself.Just to parse that title for you for those who arent familiar with SAP, Jam is the companys community product, created several years ago to facilitateemployee communication. Hybris is an ecommerce product SAPbought in 2013. Bringing the two technologies together, SAP is hoping to createsites and apps that help consumers whenthey need it most with an appropriate level of content, whether from the company or community.To achieve that, the companysays the toolwas built with what itcalled an API-first approach.In practice this means, that every component of the service is containerized, delivered as a micro-service and pluggable into any web page or app. This should allow customers to build a customized ecommerce experience that can adjust the appropriate amount of content,depending on the products complexity.For example, if the product involvesa fairly easybuying decision like a $10 external battery for your cell phone, then simple ratings and reviews will probably suffice, but as the buying decision gets more complex, it requires a more detailed content from various sources to walk the buyer through the purchase process  like say a car ora wind turbineThe eventual goal of any ecommercetoolis to get the visitor to buy something without leaving, and to that end, each page includes whatever content the system designers might deem necessary for a particular product, and a Buybutton. Inthe case of amore complex product, buyers might see a button for contactinga sales person, distributor or dealer, who can provide more informationandbegin to push the sale further along.SAP is hoping that this approach has advantages over traditional content marketing and ecommerce strategies where it has been difficult to measure the ROI of thecontent part of the process. Thats because the content has sometimes lacked a coherent connection to the buying experience itself, often left on a disconnected landing page.By including more of the content within the sales processinstead of ina separate place, the companybelieves it should make it easier to measure the effectiveness of your content against actual sales, giving companies easier access to datathat had previously been much more difficult to tease out.SAP officials hinted that this couldbe the first of a series of enterprise-community products. eCommerce was a natural fit, especially since the company owns Hybris, but building the product using micro services was an intentional strategy to make the product transfer more easily to other use cases in the future.
