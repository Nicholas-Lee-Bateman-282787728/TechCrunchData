Launched on Kickstarter this morning, Holus is a tabletop device that converts digital content into a 3D hologram. Created by H+ Technologies out of Vancouver, the campaign has nearly doubled its goal of $40,000 in its first 2 hours.Dont expect to use this to summon Obiwan with a seven-inch image of Princess Leia. Objects arent 3D in any sense were used to. Instead, the device is a square tabletop platform which encases a glass pyramid upon which media is projected from below. The result is an ostensibly 3D image which can be viewed from 360 degrees around the machine.Holuscomes in two versions: Pro and Home. While the Pro version is slightly bigger, the main difference is that it comes with an SDK license to develop apps for the device.The company has developed an SDK that supports game engines like Unity3D and Unreal, as well as plugins like Occipital (3D Scanning).While the company expects to deliver unitsstarting in Q2 2016, they have already demoed a working version of the device at multiple technology conferences. Additionally, the team has already created a larger, room sized version which they installed at the BC Ronald Mcdonald House to create an interactive holographic experience for children staying there.The device will eventually retail for $850, but can be preordered for an early bird price on Kickstarter now.
