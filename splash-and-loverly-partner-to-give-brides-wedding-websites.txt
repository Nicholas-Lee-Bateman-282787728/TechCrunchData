Brides in this day and age are asking for a lot. Social media tools and event tech have come a long way, giving wedding planners and brides more control over the entire experience of their wedding, from planning to booking vendors to informing guests of the weddings Instagram hashtag.But today, Splash and Loverly are partnering to take that experience to a new level, introducing wedding websites. As it stands now, Loverly provides a commerce platform for brides (inspired by the Pinterest layout) that lets brides filter content by color, category, etc. and get things settled for the big day. Splash, on the other hand, has spent the past few years offering free event websites for customers, along with a paid enterprise version for corporate clients.With the partnership, the two websites will push potential brides to a wedding website creator, where theyll be able to put up wedding info, take RSVPs, food orders, and share the couples story. After the wedding, the platform pulls in Instagram photos from a specified hashtag so that the couple and guests can peruse all photos from the event in one place.Wedding websites, powered by Splash and Loverly, is available now for free.
