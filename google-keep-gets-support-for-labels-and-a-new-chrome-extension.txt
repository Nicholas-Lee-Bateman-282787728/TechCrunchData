Keep, Googles note-taking service, is getting an update today that introduces support for hashtag-style labels and an updated Chrome extension that will make it easier to save links tosites and add notes right from the browser. None of these updates are revolutionary, butthey are definitely welcome additions to a service thatis essentially Googles version of Apples Notes app on iOS and Microsofts OneNote (though OneNote offers a far richer feature set).Just like Inbox got a new Chrome extension today, Keep is also gettinga new one today. This could get a bit confusing because there is already another Keep appin the Chrome Web Store, but that onesimply creates a link to the Keep Chrome AppinGoogles now-retiredAppLauncher (which is probably why we are now seeing the company launch all these new extensions).On Android, Keep users will nowbe able to use the system-wide Share via menu to create notes from virtually any app(including Chrome).The other major new feature in this update is support for #labels. Once youve started using these in a few notes, Keep will start auto-completing your hashtags for you.In addition, Google says it moved a few menu items aroundto make them easier to find and group similar options together. Its not a huge change, but if you are a heavy Keep user, chances are youll feel slightly disoriented for a while after installing this update.
