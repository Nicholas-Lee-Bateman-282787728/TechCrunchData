Despite a trio ofparliamentarycommittees (ISC, STCand ajoint select committee)criticizing the UK governments draft surveillance legislation and some committee members even calling for a complete rethink  the government is rushingahead anyway.Today it has introduceda tweaked version of the IP bill to parliament, and reiterated thatnew legislation needs to be in force by 31 December this year.TheInvestigatory Powers Bill (IP bill) has been trailed as a necessary piece of legislation to plug so-called capability gaps for security and law enforcement agencies, and also as an overdue update to the legal framework around the use of such powers.While never explicitly mentioned by government, the 2013 disclosures by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden underlie the controversial attempt to put mass surveillance techniques that had been used for years by domestic security agencies (not always legally) on a secure legal footing.The Home Officehas published the full text of the amended billtoday, along with a clutch of documents relating to the proposed legislation, including codes of practice for the various powers.The move comes less thana month after the billwas savaged by the Intelligence and Security committee for having inconsistent and inadequate privacy protections, yetoverly broad intrusive powers.You could say Home Secretary, Theresa May, is not for turningThe Home Office claims therevised bill and the further explanatory material it haspublished responds to the vast majority of the recommendations made by the trio of critical committees.Critics of the bill are saying the opposite  that the amended version of the billdoes little to address fundamentalconcerns with the draft bill. And indeed, even further tightens the security screw in some instances  such as by extending police access to UK citizens web browsing records for specific crimes, as the Guardianhas noted.Police will also be able to deployhacking in cases involving a threat to life or missing persons. Andpolice use of these powers does not require the so-calleddouble-lock ministerial authorisation that other intercept warrants do require.In terms of the changes it has made in response to committee feedback, thegovernment is saying ithas refined technical definitions and published additional material such as the codes of conduct in the interests of increasing clarity about how powers in the bill will be used and why they are need.It also claims to have enhanced privacy safeguards  noting specifically that it has added additional protections for journalists and lawyers.On the web browsing records elementof the legislation, it says it willcontinue to work closely with industry to develop implementation plans for retaining internet connection records in response to recommendations from the Joint Committee and the Science and Technology Committee.Internet connection records (or ISCs) refers to the requirement in the legislation that ISPs retain details on the websites accessed by users for the past 12 months. Industry concerns about the cost of implementing such a massive data capture systemareclearly not going away. And the governments early cost estimate for implementing ISCs (247 million) looks unlikely to stand still.Introducing the revised bill in parliament today, Mayclaimed recommendationsfrom the committees had provided the basis for the legislation being brought forward today.Amendments to the draft legislation she specifically flagged up include a shorterperiod of time before urgent warrants that have been authorized solelyby the Home Secretary must be retroactively reviewed by ajudicial commissioner; the adding in of statutory safeguards to prevent domestic security agencies asking overseas partnersto intercept comms where they do not have a warrant; and a degree ofclarification on the bills encryption fudge  to put beyond doubt that companies can only be asked to remove encryption that they themselves have applied (or has been applied on their behalf by a third party), and that they will not be asked to remove encryption where it is not practicable for them to do so.However she also noted thegovernment has rejected calls to eject bulk equipment interference warrants (aka mass hacking as a sanctioned state agencies investigatory technique) from the bill.This is a key operational requirement for GCHQ, she told parliament. We have published a public case for the use of bulk powers which sets out why this power remains necessary.The now publishedoperationalcase for bulk EQ, as its known, and also bulk interception (aka mass surveillance)states that these are foreign-focused powers  allowingthe security and intelligence agencies to gather overseas-related communications of terrorists, serious criminals and state based threats in parts of the world where the UK may have a limited or no physical presence.Warrants for these powers must not be sought with the intention of acquiring the communications or private data of people in the UK, it adds.(The key phrasethere is of course with the intention of  as is the case when you use a very large scoop to harvest anythingin bulk you are not able to be discriminating, and so UK citizens data is going to end up being lifted in this dragnet )Another recommendation the government has rejected is the justification of economic well-being, linked to national security, as a purpose for which some of the powers set out in the bill can be used.That is in line with the statutory purposes of the intelligence agencies and relevant European Directives, said May.Now that the full text of the bill plus detailed documents pertaining to the proposed legislation are in the public domain theres a crowdsourced scrutiny effort in train, with people tweeting out a series ofobservations that would appear to contradict government claimsWho else can apply for a hacking warrant?

The unsettling absence of a robust, technical detailed, evaluation of those bulk powers means the case still hasnt been made, and Parliament wont have the information it needs to do its job.There simply isnt time for proper scrutiny of all these powers in the timeframe proposed. More than 100 experts called on the Home Office to put on the brakes. The government must think again, he added.Earlier today a group of MPs, academics, lawyers, digital rights campaigns and others also co-signed an open letter in the Telegraphcalling on the government not to rush surveillance powers through parliament  and suggesting insteadthe government could split data retention powers into a separate bill to be dealt with this year, allowing a comprehensive Investigatory Powers Act to follow next year after adequate consultation.The Shadow Home Secretary, Labours Andy Burnham, has also said the party could withdraw its support for the IP bill unless the government allows for a longer period of scrutiny.It needed to be considerably revised after three expert reports just a matter of weeks ago, Burnham told The Independent on Sunday at the end oflastmonth. For Labours support, ministers must show they have listened to our calls for greater transparency, stronger safeguards and protection of peoples privacy.It is crucial that this Bill is not rushed and necessary time is given to consider these complex issues.The UKs third political party, the Liberal Democrats, hasalso warned theywill not support a fast-tracked bill..@timfarron : Liberal Democrats have a proud history championing civil liberties- we will not support rushed IP Bill pic.twitter.com/c0K6M8fR9I Lib Dem Press Office (@LibDemPress) February 28, 2016
