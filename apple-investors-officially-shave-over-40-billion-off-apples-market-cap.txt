It was bound to happen, but now its official. Apple shares opened at $96, down 8 percent compared to yesterdays closing price of $104.35. But because this downswing is about Apple, 8 percent represents a lot of money. In just one night, Apple investors shaved around $43 billion off the companys market capitalization.Big drops like this dont happen often for Apple given the size of the company. In 2013, for example, Apple was down 10 percent. At the time, the company suffered from a lot of uncertainty and volatility.This time, investors are afraid weve hit peak iPhone. This quarter was Apples first year-over-year sales dip when it comes to iPhone sales.Its unclear whats next for Apple. iOS is one of the two dominant platforms and Apple is comfortably selling tens of millions of iPhones every quarter. Its a huge money-making business. But investors only want to hear about growth, growth and growth.So lets put this into perspective. Apple is still worth around $539 billion. Even more relevant, Apple shares were trading at $94.69 (below todays price) on February 23.Apple is doomed! Theyve hit a 64-day low!
