GoPro president Tony Bates today revealed the company is on the verge of launching a new mobile app that will allow users to trim and share content right from their phones.According to Bates, the app is in the final phase of testing and the company expects to launch itby the end of the summer.GoPro cameras have long needed an improved software solution to enable consumers to turn hours of captured video footage into a minute or two highlight reel. This is currently a clumsy and labor-intensive process requiring the use of convoluted video editing software. Several startups are attempting a similar task.GoPro recently launched an entry-level camera called the Hero+LCD, which was the companys first product with on-camera editing. Moving editing from the desktop to mobile will allow GoPro users to share content dramatically faster.The new app sounds like a stop-gap solution until the company can fully roll out a cloud service product that will automatically edit video footage. Bates briefly mentioned that the company is pursuing a cloud-based product that will allow owners to view, but currently not edit, footage captured on a GoPro camera on other devices. Last month GoPro CEO and founder Nick Woodman explained that the company would ultimately like this cloud service to create a highlight reel for the content owner.GoPro today also revealed its second quarter financial earnings, which included a 72% increase in revenue to $420 million, swinging the company to a profit.
