One Month, the learning platform that promises a solid, enterprise-based education in one month or less, has today announced the close of an additional $1.9 million in seed funding, co-led by existing investor Idea Bulb Ventures and new investor Arena Ventures. Cornerstone On-Demand also participated in the round as a strategic investor.One Month launched back in August 2013 out of the Y Combinator accelerator with a single course, One Month Rails. The course was different from products from Codecademy and other computer science education platforms in that it had a webbed structure, allowing folks to learn exactly what they needed to build a specific type of web page instead of learning every little thing about Ruby on Rails.One Month went on to raise $770K in seed funding in June of last year, and has since expanded course offerings far beyond coding languages. For example, One Month now offers courses in Swift for iOS, HTML, and Python, as well as growth hacking, payment processing, web security, programming basics, and content marketing.The website currently lists JavaScript, UX Design, and minimal viable product building as upcoming courses soon to be available.One Month has also switched up its pricing structure, offering a subscription model instead of asking users to pay per class. Previously, users were paying up to $300 per class, but based on the new subscription structure users can pay $49/month for access to one course per month, or $100/month for access to multiple courses at a time.And beyond that, One Month has added an option for organizations who want to further educate employees with One Month for Teams.Founder Mattan Griffel, who originally built One Month because he was frustrated after unsuccessfully searching for a coder to build out a startup idea, says that the company will introduce a free tier soon, with free resources already available in the One Month Learning Library.Thus far, One Month has over 25,000 students and says that completion rates are between 2x and 3x higher than other MOOCs.One Month has raised a total of $2.6 million.
