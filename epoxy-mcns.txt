Los Angeles-based Epoxy was founded with the idea of helping YouTubers to engage with audiences and track their reach on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Vine. Today the company is announcing that its partnered with some of the largest new multichannel networks (MCNs) out there.The Epoxy dashboard makes it easier for creators to optimize their social reach by sharing videos not just on YouTube, but also on other social sites. By doing so, creators can boost viewership and overall mind share among their viewers.But Epoxy does more than that  its dashboard can also be used to track and analyze engagement on those other networks. As a result, it provides a more granular view into how audiences are interacting with creators content wherever they are sharing it.Thanks to its analytics and engagement tools, major MCNs such as Fullscreen, AwesomenessTV, and BroadbandTV have signed up to Epoxy to help them better understand the reach of creators across other social networks. Its also being used by companies like The BPM Network, The DanceOn Network, GTChannel, and INDMUSIC.Those analytics can also help those networks to do multi-platform ad deals with brands and agencies. Rather than just monetizing based on video views, those advertisers can leverage the entire social footprint of a creator to reach a specific audience and measure its effectiveness. As a result, theyre happy to pay for access to its dashboard, and urge creators to start using its engagement tools.The company has raised $8.5 million from investors that include Upfront Ventures, along with Time Warner Investments,  Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, Advancit Capital, Greycroft Partners, and Robert Downey Jr.s Downey Ventures.
