A couple of weeks ago, we published a post that pondered what investing pro rata would mean for Y Combinator. Just one month earlier, the popular accelerator programhad filed for what its calling its Y Combinator Continuity Fund, which appeared to be a growth-stage vehicle onerumored to be raising at least $1 billion.Ispeculated that if Y Combinator used the money tocherry-pick deals from its portfolio of graduateseven if it were to skipa few stages to invest in a limited number of very late-stage dealsit could create a signaling risk for many other startups it funds. Iadded as a caveat that, Itspossible that Y Combinator could follow on in every one of the venture-backed rounds of its portfolio companies, but the moment it doesnt . . .Turns out, Y Combinator is doing exactly that  aiming to support all YC companies in future financing rounds by doing its pro rata for every company in every round with a post-money valuation of $250 million or less.Its not a brand-new decision, either.As the organizations president, Sam Altman, writes in a newly published post, There were a lot of reasons why we couldnt do this in the past,but starting in the [s]ummer of 2014, we added a pro rata provision to our standard investment documents. . .Y Combinator is not going to lead any of these rounds or set the terms, just follow other investors.  he adds. And by doing this in every YC company, there will be no signaling issue of us supporting some companies and others.Smart move  and seemingly very good news for its companies and Y Combinator alike.
