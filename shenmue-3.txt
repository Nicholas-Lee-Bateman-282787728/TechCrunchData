Fans let out a collective squeal of joy when Shenmue 3 was announced at Sonys E3 conference and then rushed to pledge their support on Kickstarter. In just three hours, the campaign has raised more than $1.36 million, more than half of its $2 million goal, from about 16,000 backers.That means Shenmue 3, the long-awaited sequel to the series originally created for the Sega Dreamcast, is one of most quickly funded video games ever on Kickstarter, if not the speediest. Pledges that come with a copy of the game start at $29 for a PC or PS4 version. TechCrunch has reached out to the crowdfunding platform to see where the project stands.According to Kickstarter, Shenmue hit $1 million in one hour and 42 minutes, making it the second fastest project to hit that amount, behind Pebble Time smartwatch. That makes it the fastest game project to achieve $1 million, usurping Torment: Tides of Numenera (six hours 5 minutes).[Update: Shenmue hit its full $2 million funding goal ineight hours38 minutes, which puts it secondbehind Pebble Time (one hour seven minutes) in terms of speed, and ahead of theVeronica Mars movie(nine hours five minutes).]On Kickstarter, Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki said we are balancing our ambitions for a grand sequel with the pragmatic realities of developing a game of this scale. It will not be easy, but I have dreamed of making this sequel for 14 yearsit is time to bring Shenmue back!Check out our videocast of E3 here.
