The Gillmor Gang  John Borthwick, Robert Scoble, Kevin Marks, Keith Teare, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Friday, April 10, 2015. Scoble returns to The Gang, on the road to Coachella after two months off social media. Meanwhile, we pay a visit to John Borthwick at his Betaworks Studio, where we get updates on Instapaper and live streaming app UpClose. A good thing too, as a Bay Area Comcast outage shuts things down at the end but not before UpClose comes to the rescue.@stevegillmor, @borthwick, @scobleizer, @kevinmarks, @kteareProduced and directed by Tina Chase Gillmor @tinagillmorLive chat streamLiner NotesThe Gillmor Gang on Facebook
