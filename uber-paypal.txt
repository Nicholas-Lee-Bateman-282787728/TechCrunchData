PayPal teamed up with Uber back in 2013 to offer the U.S.taxi-hailing services customersadditional payment options. The world has changed a lot in those 18 months  Uber is now present in over 300 cities with China set to soon become its largest market  so, with that in mind, PayPal and Uber have extended their partnership to cover an additional 9 countries worldwide.Now, Uber riders in Canada, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland can use PayPal to pay for their tripswithout using a credit card. Thats in addition to those inAustralia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, UK andthe U.S. who have had that option since 2013.The deal appears, at face value, to be a more significant one for PayPal than for Uber. While Uber is known for cash-less payments, which require its users to owna credit card, it is running its acash payments test in Indiaas it looks to extend its reach in emerging markets. In some respects, thisPayPal integration acts like a halfway step for those without a credit card, although youd suspect that a sizable number of people with PayPal accounts also owna credit card.For PayPal, though, working with Uber is an opportunity to tap into its vast (and now very global) network of users to spur more new sign-ups or re-engage less active users.Interestingly, China and India  two of Ubers fastest growing markets and two of the worlds biggest countries, to boot  are absent fromthis list. Thats for good reason. Legal issues forced Uber to adopt an in-apppayment wallet in India last year  it partnered with Alibaba-backed Paytm  so PayPals service is a little redundant there.In the case of China, local payment systems like Alipay and Baidu Wallet  Baidu invested in Uber  are the leadingonline payment solutions. Alipay, in fact, reportedly processes three times as many payments as PayPal,and it already works with Uber in China. PayPal just isnt a thing in China.
