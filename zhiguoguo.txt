Protecting intellectual property in China is notoriously difficult, even though the country is trying to set up legal safeguards to aid emerging industries. Zhiguoguo wants to help businesses preserve their IP by providing free trademark registration and affordable legal services.Based in Beijing, the startup announced that it has raised a $3.7 million series A led by Matrix Partners China, with participation from returning investor Legend Star. Founder Sisi Liu says that Zhiguoguo has processed 20,000 orders since May 2014. Its new capital will be used for marketing, hiring, and increasing Zhiguoguos roster of paid legal and consulting services.According to Wabei, more than 2 million trademarks were registered in China last year and that number is expected to increase at least 30 percent every year. The process can be difficult and tedious, however, with registration requirements differing from region to region. Zhiguoguo helps businesses by giving them the same online forms regardless of where their business is based. It charges for additional services like trademark changes or transfers and copyright applications, with prices starting from 500 yuan (about $80).Zhiguoguos last funding was an undisclosed angel round raised in June 2014.
