Samsungs slow recovery appears to be continuing after the South Korean tech company release its financial projections for the final quarter of 2015, although theyare lower thanindustry analyst expectations.The firm said todaythat it expects to see a 6.1 trillion KRW ($5.1 billion) profit on totalsales of 53 trillion KRW ($44 billion) for Q4 2015. That would represent a 15 percent year-on-year increase in profit on its very poor Q4 2014 quarter, but a 7.5 percent dip on Samsungs Q3 2015 profit. Analysts had expected the company to post total revenue of 6.6 trillion KRW,a figure which itlooks like it will fall shy of. Well find out for sure when the full figures are released at the end of this month.Theres plenty of caution coming from the company already though.Samsung co-CEOKwon Oh-hyun warned employees that 2016 could be another challenging year for the Korean giant.The global economy will continue to see tepid growth while uncertainty will grow in emerging markets accompanying financial risks, he said in a New Years speech, according a Wall Street Journal report.Samsung is under pressure from Apple in the high-end of the smartphone market, while a collection of Chinese OEMs, ledby a resurgent Huawei and theever-competitive Xiaomi,are battling it in the mid- and low-end sectors, particularly in emerging markets like Latin America, India and Southeast Asia.Added to that, global smartphone shipments growth isexpected to continue toslow, continuing the trend that began mid last yearprimarily due to lowergrowthin China, which is the worlds largest phone market. That trend is impacting all phone-makers, not just Samsung, but, as one of the bigdogs in its space, Samsung could feelthe chill harder than most.
