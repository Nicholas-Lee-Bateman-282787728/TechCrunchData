If you didnt keep your ear to the page this weekend, especially regardingthe news that relates to how Microsoft will allow  or not!  folks that pirated previous versions of Windows toget, or not, Windows 10, I am here to help.However, you cant stop poetry in motion, and you also cant writea better story than reality, so to save time, heres ZDNets Mary Jo Foley from earlier today:See that bottom line? Here is a small tip: If Mary Jo doesnt get it, no one gets it. As far as the reporter class goes, Foley is akin to Nostradamus on the Microsoft beat. So, if she is still twisted, things make as much sense as thatscene from Jurassic World when Muscley Dude rode his motorcycle through the woods with the raptors.Anyhoo, it shouldnt be too much of a surprise that people who pirated Windows wont get the free ride to Windows 10. Microsoft is remaking itself, but not at so rapid a clip that it intends to give away what literally built its business.Windows as a service indeed. But not officially for pirates, because that just wouldnt convert.So here comes Windows 10 in 37 days. But not for pirates. At least not officially.
