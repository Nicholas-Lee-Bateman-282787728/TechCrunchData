Social media company Sprinklr has acquired Booshaka, a company aiming to give businesses a better understanding of their audience.Specifically, Booshaka has built one-click connectors to pull customer data from services like Marketo, Shopify and Stripe, then use that data to build audience segments for ad campaigns on Facebook and Twitter.Simon Mansell, Sprinklrs general manager of paid and services, said that by integrating Booshaka technology, the company can bring in customer data from, say, ExactTarget, then combine it with social listening data to create a profile of that person, putting them in a segment based on their interests and likely business value. That, in turn, allows Sprinklrto improve social ad targeting, andover time, thedata could be used in areasbeyond advertising.The macro thing is that marketing tech and ad tech should come together, Mansellsaid. The bridge between ad tech and marketing tech is audience management  basically, bringing in customer data and enhancing it with social listening data and then using it for effective media targeting and better quality customer care.The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Booshaka founder and CEO Erik Ober said his entire 10-person Booshaka team will be joining Sprinklr.Mansell said this will follow the pattern of other Sprinklr acquisitions: When we acquire companies, we basically rebuild the code. The main reason we do that is so that [the whole platform is] truly one code.Booshaka investors include SV Angel, PivotNorth Capital, FF Angel, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and others.
