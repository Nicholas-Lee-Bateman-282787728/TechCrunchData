Launched in 2011, the company has since raised around $80M in four fundraising rounds.The acquisition, which is InVisions first, comes after a long collaboration between the two companies on products like Motion and Inspect.Macaw, which has 125k active users, originally raised about $300,000 during a 2013 Kickstarter campaign.Tom Giannattasio, Founder and CEO of Macaw, explained that the company always wanted to join a larger team, and InVision was the first time it made sense.InVision explainedthat acquiring Macaw will help them achieve their goal of bridging the design-to-development gap by implementing Macaws design to code features into InVisions products.Notably, InVision is not shutting down Macaw. The company will indefinitely allow access to the current version, while Macaws latest product Scarlet (a live, real-time design environment) will be bundled into other InVision products this year.
