Apps like Tinder have gained popularity by shallowly focusingpurely on physical attractiveness. Its unfortunate, but also understandable. How is one supposed to boil down something as complex as the ideal personality ofones perfect mate with an app? Well, Oscar Mayer believes it has found theperfect equation for this and it all comes down to bacon.Today the company released Sizzl, a dating app that allows lovestruck users a closed network of bacon lovers where they canscour for their ideal dates. This totally real dating appallows people to specify their bacon preferences in a customizable profile, upload photos and start swiping through profiles of local fellow bacon lovers, with the ability to message and meet up with other Sizzl users based on a mutual-matching system, according to a company press release.After downloading the app, users are thrown into a bacon questionnaire where they are asked to specify such deeply personal preferences as whether they prefer pork or turkey bacon or whether they enjoy their bacon crispy or chewy, in addition to a number of other judgment calls that deeply reflect on their character.In love, as it is in bacon, its important to be discerning when selecting your perfect match and to never settle for less than the best, said Eric Dahmer,Oscar Mayers marketing director in a statement. With the launch of Sizzl, were thrilled to give our true bacon lovers the chance to find each other and potentially meet their soulmates, in life and in bacon.This app goes past the simple swipe left/right UI that other hookup apps have gravitated towards. Instead Sizzl allows users to specify the intensity of their attraction by holding down on the sizzl button for a certain amount of time. The longer you hold down the button, the more intense your attraction is to that potential lover.I have yet to findany matches, which I suspect has something to do with my profile picture, but once I find love I will be sure to check out the chat feature, as well as invite you all to the wedding.
