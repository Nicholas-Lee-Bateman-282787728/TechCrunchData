Whats the only thing worse than a full inbox? An inbox full of spammy newsletter emails you dont really want to read.Throttle is a plugin that solves this problem by generating a unique email address for eachpurchase you make or newsletter you sign up for online.Then, all email sent to these addresses are collected and sent to you in one daily digest email. Throttle also makes these emails available on their website, efficiently sortedinto dozens of categories.Since the service generates a custom address for each company that emails you, its easy to see what companies have sold your email address. And, if you do notice one of the custom addresses is being used for spam, Throttle lets you revoke access and shut off the custom address with one click.Interestingly, some marketers have actually found it beneficial for their subscribers to use Throttle, since it essentiallyguarantees a 100% delivery rate, and a much higher chance of their content actually being read.The service launched in January, but today is becoming free for all users. Plus, the company is launching a Pro version for $3.99 per month, which supports digests for multiple email accounts, instant forwarding if you dont want to wait for the daily digest, and the ability to use custom domains.Throttles browser extension is currently available for Safari, Chrome, and Opera, with Firefox in the works. The company isalso working ona mobile app, which will be offered to Pro subscribers as a beta version before it launches to the public.
