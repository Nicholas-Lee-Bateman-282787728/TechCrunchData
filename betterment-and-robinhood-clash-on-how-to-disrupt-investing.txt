What does the future of the financial services industry look like? The founders of two startups with two very different answers to that question took the stage at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2016 conference this morning to discuss how theyre planning to disrupt traditional brokerages.Vlad Tenev, co-founder and co-CEO of millennial-focused investing app Robinhood believes in doing away with commissions on trades and making it easy for anyone to invest with a push of a button. Betterments co-founder and CEOJon Stein effectively believes the opposite  that people shouldnt invest their own money without guidance.We think peopleshouldnt actually be investing on their own, he said, calling it a crazy way to manage your money.His companys solution doesnt try to make money off of its customers money, either  like earning interest on uninvested cash, for example, or the other less-than-transparent ways that firms have traditionally boosted their margins in addition to customer-facing fees.Instead, Betterments customers pay a fee for investment assistancethat helps themachieve goals like saving for retirement, buying a home and other plans that require capital.We believe that making money off your money withoutyou knowing about it makes us unaligned with our customers, explainsStein.Meanwhile, Tenevs startup is able to offer commission-free trades precisely because it follows the old model used byretail brokerages that involves generating revenue outside of commissions.He also argued that there are different use cases for an app like Robinhood, where people invest without guidance. Not every investment is about saving for retirement or building up a nest egg, he said.If someonereally strongly believes in a company and supports them  maybe because of something theyread, or maybe because theybought their products, then its not necessarilyour job as peoplewho make the software to tell you that you shouldnt be investing, Tenev countered.The two startups, therefore, couldnt be more different  one offers commission-free trades that are user-directed, the other helps you invest smartly for a fee.However, one area where the two are aligned is in disrupting the big banksand brokerages.Wewanted to take the technologyinstitutions are using andmake that available to retail investors, said Stein. We think its harder for retail investors to compete in the market  if youre a retail investor the game is rigged against you.Robinhood is also about taking down the big banks, having grown out of the discontent for the financial services industry in general, as characterized by the Occupy Wall Street demographic.People lost trustin the financialsystem  especially peoplein our age group, he says, referring the millennial customers who would use an app like Robinhood.Despite their different strategies, both seem to be well on their way to achieving their goals of challengingthe old guard and old way of doing things.Tenev says that Robinhoodhas grown to nearly a million customers, and a few months ago announced it had passed 3 billion transactions taking place on its platform. Its now expanding internationally, including into China, where 20,000 people have joined a waitlist to access the service when it opens, which will allowthem to trade on the U.S. stock market.Stein, meanwhile, said that Betterment is profitable onevery customer, as most clients have grown their balances 50 percent in the last year, and its own share of the wallet, in turn, has also grown.Now its goal is to become the market leader, in terms of tech firms operating in the space the way Amazon dominates e-commerce or Netflix does with streaming video.Its crazy theres not a single tech company thats leading the future of financial services, he said, we want to be that company.Let Your Fingers do the Investing with Robinhood and Betterment(full panel) #TCDisrupt https://t.co/ZodTw2y9pX TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) May 10, 2016
