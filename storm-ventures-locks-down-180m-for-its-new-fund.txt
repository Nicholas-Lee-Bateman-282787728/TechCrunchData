Storm Ventures has joined nearly every other startup capital entity in raising a new, larger fund. Storms fifth fund is a $180 million vehicle that the firm has stapled a new venture partner to.As a group, Storm is known for its work with SaaS-focused companies. Its own Jason Lemkin, the other guest in the above segment, is something of aBay Area uncle for SaaS, in that he has a habit of dishing tidbits about selling software on a subscription basis on Quora and other social services.Storm joins NEA, IVP, Freestyleand others in locking down an expanded fresh fund. The impactof these sequentially larger funds isnt hard to understand: The capital flowing into startups likely wontslow. What sort of companies, and what stage of companies the money applies to is a separatequestion.But what seems obvious is that the core substance that is allowing companies to invest  spend heavily on quick growth is not only still in place, but growing.What is gravity, anyway, but a non-GAAP metricdesigned to degrade your dollar churn on a year-over-year basis.
