Apple Design Award-winning slacker-productivity appFinish is announcing its biggest update in a year today with the release of version 3.0 on the App Store.The biggest change isnt the introduction of any major feature in particular; instead, Finish designer Ryan Orbuch tells me that the update is all about opening up the apps premium feature set for its entire user base.In a phone call, Orbuch told TechCrunch that hisapps target market of procrastinating teenagers just doesnt pay for things on the App Store. Rather than locking what he considered to be some of the apps key features (adding more than 10 tasks, letting you set specific times for when tasks had to be completed, and an optional bother me notification every hour when key tasks became overdue) behind a paywall, Orbuch decided to open them up to everyone who could benefit.The specific timing of the release is based in part on technical issues, however. There were some bugs in Finishbehind the scenes that were exposed to users under iOS 8. Most of these didnt break anything major, but one feature key to monetizing the app without in-app purchases, rewards from Kiip, was impacted.Those rewards had been in the app for much of 2014, but had to be removed entirely after users who updated to iOS 8noticed issues with them. Orbuch has spent the last few months working on getting them back into the app and fixing the other problems exposed. Users of Finish 3.0 will receive rewards (basically, ads that they wont hate completely) one-out-of-three-ish times they complete a task in the app.While we were talking about Finish, Orbuch and I got sidetracked about something else hes working on for middle- and high-school students: a peer-to-peer learning app. Hes been thinking about education for a long time, and now has a co-founder and funding (raised in a small angel round) for the idea hes been kicking around for a few years now. He wasnt able to give many details at this time other than noting that hes looking to hireiOS and backend developers.
