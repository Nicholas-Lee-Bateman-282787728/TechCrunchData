App Annie, the nearly six-year-old, San Francisco-based app analytics firm that long ago became the first stop for developers, investors, and journalists looking tobetter understand app rankings and trends, has raised $63 million in Series E funding in mostly equity and debt, says cofounder and CEO Bertrand Schmitt.The round was led by Greenspring Associates, with participation from earlier backers e.Ventures, Greycroft Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, and Sequoia Capital.The debtraised to avoid diluting stakeholders unnecessarily, says Schmitt  was provided to the company by Silicon Valley Bank.The financing comes almost exactly one year after App Annie closed on $55 million in funding and brings the companys total funding to roughly $157 million.The new capital is meantto fuelthecompanys already rapid growth, says Schmitt, who says App Annie has reached breakeven cash flow at various points but isnt profitableby design.Part of that owes to overhead;in the last year, it hasgrown from 300 employees to more than 400 today, with 160 people in North America, 200 in Asia, and another 60 or so in Western Europe. It expects to have way more than 500 employees by year end, too, Schmitt says.Schmitt also suggests that more acquisitions could be in App Annies future. Last year, the company paid an undisclosed amount to buy the mobile measurement service Mobidia, which itself had raised just more than $16 million in funding over the years.In 2014, it acquired its closest competitor with its purchase of Distimo. (Terms of that deal werent disclosed, either.)Acquisitions arent our main strategy, but its one of our tactics to get to our goal of ensuring we have the right offerings to satisfy our users, says Schmitt. Sometime we build internally, but if we can find good value somewhere else, why not? A bigger war chest ensures we can react quickly if we see interesting opportunities.Naturally, with more funding, the company also has more options, including to push off any thought of an IPO for another year. AnIPO is definitely not in the cards for 2016, says Schmitt, though its worth noting that with App Annies new funding, it hasalso appointed NetSuite CEO Zach Nelsonwho has overseen Netsuites rise from a startup through a successful IPO in 2007to its board of directors.The roundalso gives App Annie more time to pull itself into the black, presumably. Though the company right now claims 500,000 registered members,hundreds pay the company a yearly subscription for its advanced analytics services, says Schmitt.Fortunately for App Annie, even comparatively small numbers canadd upto a big business, as long as the company continuesto build on them. An average yearly contract costs a subscriber$80,000 per year.
