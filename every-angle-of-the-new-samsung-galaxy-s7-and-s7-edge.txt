Samsung aimed to gather the best features of Galaxies past fortheir S7 line. That included features missing from the S6 like water resistance and a microSD slot, but the companyalso took the improved design from the S6 line and made it even better. Check out the photos above to see every angle of the sleek new hardware and look here for a run-down of everything thats new.Youll be sure to notice the improved designof the larger S7 edgeas soon as you pick one up. The sharp, flat back of the S6 edge has lost its unpleasantness and has beenreplaced with lightly curved edgesthat feels exceptionally more comfortable in your hand.Other thanthe new dual-SIM microSD slot (which sits in the same positioning) the ports remain unchanged, a major feat given the top-of-the-line IP68 water resistance. On that note, Samsung confirmed to methat the phone should be able to withstand a half hour of submersion at about five feet ofdepth. This means itll be no problem to take anS7into the shower or pool without worrying for your devices life.The devices will be available March 11, with pre-orders beginning tomorrow at 8:00AM EST.
