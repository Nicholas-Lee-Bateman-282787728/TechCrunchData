Remember that incredibly neat soccer-ball lookin robot from the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer? The fans started debating about it pretty much immediately, as they tend to do. How the hell did it work? It had to be CGI, right?NOPE!Its name is BB-8, and its totally real.Well, real in the sense that theres some dude off-camera puppeteering it  but still! Actual, physical hardware  not CGI. No strings, no wires, no Kenny Baker hiding inside  just damned beautiful engineering and design work.The Force Unleashed crew rolled BB-8 out on stage today during a panel at the Star Wars Celebration event.Neil Scanlan and his incredible team built and puppeteered BB-8 in the movie, and did an extraordinary job. noted director J.J. Abrams  It was better for the actors, better for the film itself  youll see their work. It was amazing.The way it moves is just incredible; Ive got plenty of ideas for how theyre pulling it off, but now Im itching for the behind-the-scenes stuff almost as much as the movie itself. Itll be interesting to see whether they try to miniaturize this tech for the inevitable toy release, or if the BB-8 toys end up being a bit less dynamic.
