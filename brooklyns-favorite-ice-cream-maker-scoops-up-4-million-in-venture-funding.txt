Ample Hills Creamery, a Brooklyn-based chain of ice cream shops that has become renowned for its unusual and decadent creations, has raised $4 million in funding from Brooklyn Bridge Ventures, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Red Sea Ventures, and individual investors, including Brooklyn Brewer co-founder Tom Potter, who led a CircleUp syndicate that joined the round.While a somewhat atypical investment for venture investors, Ample Hills appealed to its backers for a number of reasons, says Charlie ODonnell of Brooklyn Bridge Ventures. For starters, the business is already an established brand, having appeared on the Food Network and on the lists of numerous organizations that have ranked it among the top ice creameries in New York and even the country.Its ice cream shops are growing fast. Starting with a flagship store in Prospect Heights, husband-and-wife owners Brian Smith and Jackie Cuscuna have more recently opened stores in Brooklyn Bridge Park and Gowanus, along withtwo smaller outposts in Manhattan.ODonnell, who began unofficially advising the couple on expansion and retail opportunities earlier this year, said he also began to realize their conversations werevery much like those he has with tech startups. It was Who do we hire? What do we focus on? How do we not run out of money? And frankly, says ODonnell, I probably know more about ice cream than the fashion-tech companies Ive invested in.With savvy marketing and flavors that aim toevoke visitors childhoods  last month, when the Mets were playing in the World Series, Ample Hillscreated a special ice cream flavorwithkettle cornandpeanut brittle; its also known to employ homemade peppermints and malt balls the company is already doing millions in revenue, says ODonnell.Now, armed withthatfresh $4 million, it will be building out its management team, working to expand the reach of its wholesale pint distribution (including via selectgrocery stores and through a direct-to-consumer model), and creating itsfirst larger-scale production facility.They literally cant make any more ice cream thanthey already do from their current location, says ODonnell.
