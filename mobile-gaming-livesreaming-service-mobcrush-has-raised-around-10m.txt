Weve heard from sources that Mobcrush, a live-streaming service centered around mobile games much in the same way Twitch is known for streaming popular eSports desktop games,has raised around $10 million in new financing, though the number could have gone beyond that.Mobcrushs bet is that mobile game streaming will be as big  if not bigger  than some of the competitive game-streaming services that already exist. The gorilla in the room, of course, is Twitch  which Amazon bought for nearly $1 billionlast year and has tens of millions (if not hundreds) of monthly viewers.Mobcrush raised $4.9 million in a round that round was formally announced in May, and in JulyMobcrush came out of beta.To be sure, mobile games are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Some of the most popular games on the App Store are strategy games like Clash of Clans. And while these games are lightweight, phones are becoming more and more powerful and gainingmore touch points  meaning its ever more likely that someone will figure out a way to replicate the complex nature of mobile games (withone new example of a new touch point beingForce Touch, which is expected to end up in the next iPhone).We heard Kleiner Perkins participated in the most recent funding round, with two sources telling us the firm led the round. We were toldthe round was incredibly competitive, as you might expect for a company making a bet on a mobile Twitch.Mobcrush does not comment on rumors or speculations about our financing, CEO Royce Disini said. Were focused on our execution, excited about our growth and the big opportunity for mobile game live streaming, and have added [three] key hires from Apple, Google and Microsoft to help accelerate our growth.The counter argument to all this is that there isnt a set of games like Starcraft that will eventually end up on mobile. Given the lightweight nature of mobile games, its possible that there just wont be a market for hardcore games like League of Legends, even though several well-funded companies like Super Evil Megacorp are going after the space with games like Vainglory.And, to be fair, Twitch could build something similar and crush Mobcrush (no pun intended). It already has a huge presence on mobile devices andhas broadcasts of Vainglory.Twitch is not unfamiliar with finding its way to new markets, pivoting originally from a live-streaming site to focus on video games and creating a $1 billion company in the process.Mobiles Starcraft momenthasnt happened just yet. However, all roads dolead to mobile  and it seems more and more likely, especially with the arrival of Hearthstone (which is of course on PC) on smartphones, that its possiblecompanies will find a way to build a hit game that will be popular among the esports crowd.
