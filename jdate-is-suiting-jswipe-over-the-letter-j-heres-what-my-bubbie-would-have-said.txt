Der oylam is a goylem.It means the world is stupid in Yiddish.Today, Forbes unearthed a lawsuit from late last year that Jewish dating site JDates parent company filed against an app called JSwipe (also aimed at Jewish folk). Its over the use of the letter J. The case is set to pick up again next month.Yes. I told you that the world was stupid.Separately, its defending a patent that: confidentially determines matches and notifies users of mutual matches in feelings and interests. So basically its saying it has a patent on matching people together.In fact, this isnt the first time that JDate has gone after companies over this patent. In 2011, JDate went after dating sites Zoosk, OkCupid and 2RedBeans over the same thing:Sparks Network (JDates parent company) has invented a method or apparatus for automating the process of confidentially determining whether people feel mutual attraction or have mutual interests.This is yet another reminder that patent law needs reform and trolls like Sparks Network shouldnt be allowed to drag smaller competitors through the mud just to try and squash them.@drew Mine would have sighed, sighed again, shook her head, and mumbled "you're all meshuganeh!"
