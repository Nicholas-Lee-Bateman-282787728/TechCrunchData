Anotable moment in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) happened today after DeepMind  the London-based company owned byGoogle  defeated Go world championLee Sedol using its technology.In the first of a five match series held in Seoul, Korea, today, AlphaGo gained an early advantageafter forcing Lee to concede the game with less than 29 minutes left on the clock. The series, which concludes next Tuesday, is being broadcast live on YouTube witha $1 million prize forthe winner.The progression of AI is marked by victories against top players in many strategy games. Deep Blue defeated Chess grandmasterGarry Kasparov in 1997, IBMs Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011, but the strategy and intellectual depth of Go  a centuries-old East Asian game  has provided the stiffestchallenge to AI creators, as Google itself has acknowledged.DeepMind, which was acquired by Google for over $500 million two years ago, created its own program specifically for the game: AlphaGo. Ittriumphedagainst European championFan Hui last October, the first time an AIhad beaten a human opponent in Go,but 33-year-old Lee  a Go legend and nine-dan pro  isthetoughest opponenton the planet.Speaking after the win against Fan Huilast year, DeepMind co-founderDemis Hassabis explained that AlphaGos development is ongoing since itrefinesit game techniques by itself:AlphaGo is now going beyond  hopefully, eventually  what even the best humans in this area can do. Its quite an amazing feeling to see what new things its going to invent, within the constraints of the game of Go. I guess we feel a lot of affinity with the system weve built, especially because of the way its been built  it has learned, weve trained it in some sense, and its playing in quite a human-like style. And its different from a program youve hand-crafted where you know all the nuances of what you can do: here it has picked up things for itself, so its amazing to see the kind of capabilities it has learned.Well see what lessons Lee tookfrom the first match up this Thursday when the second game is scheduled.
