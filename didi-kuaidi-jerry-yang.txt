Didi Kuaidi, the largest car-hailing app in China, announced today that it has addedYahoo co-founder Jerry Yang to its board as its senior advisor. In a statement, the company said Yangs experience will help it build its mobile platform, which is already used by 250 million people in China.The appointment also reinforces the network ofrelationshipsDidi Kuaidi has formed with some of the worlds largest tech companies, including SoftBank, Tencent and Alibaba. Yang, of course, is closely tied with Alibaba: He led Yahoos purchase of a 40 percent stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant 10years ago.Together, these companies are forming a worldwide alliance to take on Uber, which is reportedly seeking yet more funding that will raise its valuation to $62.5 billion, with much of the capital earmarked for expansion in Asia. Didi Kuaidi, Lyft in the U.S., leading Indian car-hailing app Ola, and GrabTaxi, which holds most of the market in Southeast Asia, are now alignedthrough investments and mutual venture capital backers.Didi Kuaidi was created when Chinas two largest car-hailing appsKuaidi Dache and Didi Dachemerged earlier this year. Kuaidi Daches investors included Alibaba, SoftBank, and Tiger Global, while Didi Dache counted Tencent, DST Global, and Temasek Holdings among its biggest backers. SoftBank other ride app investments includeOla and GrabTaxi, while Alibaba contributed funding to Lyft. After its merger, Didi Dache became an investor in all three companies, too.Though all four companiesDidi Dache, Lyft, Ola, and GrabTaxihave said that they plan to remain independent, their close relationship represents one of the biggest hurdles Uber faces as it seeks global dominance.Didi Kuaidis allegiancewith some of Chinas biggest Internet firms also made itself felt this weekend when WeChat, which is owned by Tencent, said it would block Uber. Tencent claimed this was because of malicious marketing by Uber, but the move also makes it much harder for Uber to reach customers in China because WeChat is the countrys largest messaging app and an important platform for businesses.Uber, however, isnt completely alone in China. Its main ally and investor there is Baidu, the maker of the countrys largest search engine, which means it is integrated into popular mobile apps like Baidu Maps.Didi Kuaidi hasnt given specific details about how it will work with Yang, but in a statement, founder and chief executive officer Cheng Wei (a former Alibaba executive) said Yangs experience and insights on the global and Asian technology sector will greatly benefit Didis long-term strategy to build a leading mobile internet platform of global scale.
