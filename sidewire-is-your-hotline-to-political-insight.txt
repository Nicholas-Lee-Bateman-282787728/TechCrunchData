Aiming to help people cut through all of thepolitical noise, Sidewire, a political news analysis platform, is launching today on iOS, just in time for tonightssecond Republican presidentialdebate.Sidewire is the brainchild of Tucker Bounds, who was formerly the national spokesman for John McCains 2008 presidential campaign before heading up corporate communications at Facebook, and Andy Bromberg, a 21-year-old Stanford CS dropout.To power the project, the two have pulled in $4.85 million in seed funding from Spark Capital (early investors in Twitter and Tumblr) with participation from Goldcrest Capital and a handful of angels.Essentially what were looking to do is create a place where people can find the most important political news, and also what the most important people to that news are talking about, says Bounds.Sidewire has assembled a group of more than 100 political journalists, analysts, candidates, campaign managers and elected officials who are responsible for curating the content on the platform.These influencers enter the link to any news articleinto Sidewire along with their 250-character take on it, which is overlaid on an image card. With one click, they can push the card out to Sidewire, as well as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.If the AP publishes an article about Democratic candidate Martin OMalley urging Obama to increase aid for Syrian refugees, for instance, OMalleys campaign manager mightpost the article to Sidewire with a blurb touting her candidates moral leadership on this global crisis.The real value of Sidewire, though, is in the commentary from journalists and analysts whothen debate OMalleys stance and discuss the political consequences ofincreasing support to refugees.If its taken over by campaign operatives, Sidewire runs the risk of becoming another noise machine. Sothe team is slowly adding influencers by a referral process, Bounds says, in an effort to maintaina balanced conversation.Currently, the app has representatives from virtually all of the different running campaigns, along with five U.S. Senators, a number of congressmen, and prominent political analysts like Dan Pfeiffer, David Axelrod and Chuck Todd. For this group, Sidewire provides a promotional tool, as well as a restricted space for debate.For news consumers outside this sphere of influence, Sidewire provides a window in.General users have the ability to like content (which determines its rank on the page), as well as share and chat withinSidewires internal chat feature. Influencers, in turn, receive analytics around user engagement.Theres no lack of great content and smart people saying interesting things, but how its packaged and organized for consumers is a big challenge, says Kevin Thau, who led the Sidewire investment for Spark. By making political news more approachable and digestible, and not so daunting and intimidating, it should get more people into whats going on.For those who want a hot take, its there in the 250-character blurbat the top of each post. If you want more background, Sidewire provides the option to click through to the original article, and also pulls in recent articles on the same topic.Initially were expecting to have a great uptake within the insider community, but weve actually seen empirically in our beta tests that people who are not normally engaged with political news have gotten really into the type of analysis on the platform, Bromberg says.Considering that only 41.9 percent of voting-age Americans showed up to the polls in 2014, engaging a broader segment of adults in political discussion is essential to impacting future policy.Its easy to imagine Sidewire translating its platform toother news verticals, whether thats business, finance, sports, or even the entertainmentindustry. Providing a curated news feed for consumers, as well as special privileges forinfluencers, is a concept weve seen from nearly every major social network, but theres yet to be a single platform that serves both newsmakers and news consumers simultaneously.Naturally, I asked Bounds when the tech media version of the app would be released.Theres no reason why we couldnt build Sidewire for other verticals, but right now were exclusively focused on politics for the 2016 election, he said.
