Facebook at Work  the enterprise version of Facebookthat lets businesses build their own secure social networks has racked up over 60,000 companies on a waiting list while still inclosed beta. And as it gears up for a full global launchandnew features like an app platform later this year, Facebook is announcing its newest big customer. As of today, Telenor, the carrier based out of Norway with operations in some 13countries covering 203 million people, is turning on Facebook for 36,000 employees globally.Sigve Brekke, President & CEO of Telenor Group, told TechCrunch that his company had actually been one of the first to trial the product as part of a wider collaboration with the social network. We wanted to change how people work internally, he said, which included not just how hes able to speak to employees, but how groups could use the platform to break down traditional work silos and communicate better.Facebook, he added, was a natural option since so many already use it and are familiar with it, whether on desktop or  as is a lot more likely in the markets where Telenor operates  on mobile.Telenor owns carriers in still-developing countrieslike Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Pakistan ad minority stakes in 14 morevia Vimplecom, and it has been an early collaborator on projects like Free Basics as well as the engineeringeffortsFacebook has been makingto expand mobile network reach, such as Infra, which was unveiled last week at MWC.There are now more than 450 enterprises using Facebook at Work, with new additionsgetting announced regularly. Without marking time on each and every one of them, Telenor is notable for a fewreasons.Its aglobal carrier, and the largestglobal enterprise to sign up to date, according to Julien Codorniou, who heads up FB at Work globally. (The Royal Bank of Scotland plans to have 100,000 people on its own Facebook network but that is by the end of this year; right now its working on onboarding 30,000.)And signing up a carrier potentially points to oneway that Facebook may choose to grow its future customer base: carriers have strong IT businesses, where they sell services that operate on their networks, and so they can become a sales channel for the social network. (To be clear, Telenors main interest is in rolling out Facebook at Work to its own employees, not reselling it, Brekke said.)One reason a carrier channel would make sense is that it could help the social network scale the business without scaling up its own staff. Sales is the area that Codorniou says is still the biggest bottleneck for the company when trying to scale the new enterprise business.As part of this, thecompany in February quietly hired Monica Adractas, a longtime VPat Box, to head up sales in North America, and Codorniou  who is based out of London  actually spoke to me after getting off a plane in Singapore, where it is also aggressively expanding its Work team.He says that Asia is by far the region where Facebook has seen the most companieskeen to sign up for Facebook at Work. Its something of a first-come race at the moment, it seems: Slack, one of its big competitors in the space of workforce communication, has not made much headway into the East. (Not yet, at least: YoungSlackhas caught on like wildfire in several Western markets, burning perhaps only a few in the process.)Another reason why Facebook at Work may be catching the interest of businesses in Asia is because of Facebooks popularity there, especially among mobile users. Indeed, Facebook is taking an approach that reminds me a bit of Cotap, another employee communication platform founded by early Yammer employees. Both areaiming theirservices not just at the knowledge workers that Slack targets, but those who are on the move and at different tiers of the business that do not involve sitting at a desk.Iwould say Asia is very strong for Facebook at Workinterest, Codorniou said from Singapore. Here we have companies with thousands of employees but up to now no way to connect them all. Sometimes we are giving access to Facebook at Workto people who never even had a company email address.And in this regard, theTelenor deal is also interesting in that it will help Facebook work out the kinks for how it would approach a global rollout for an enterprise working inmore tricky markets. Facebook, the consumer-facingsocial network, has come under some scrutiny and has even been banned at times for hosting content that States have deemed inappropriate.Telenor, with its footprint into emerging markets, has been among those under government pressure to bar access to the social network in the past, and it has complied.From what we understand, Facebook at Work for now will fall under those same policies.Facebook at Work will adhere to the instructions it receives from its partners; so if Telenor is requested to shut down certain content by a government, Facebook will implement that on Telenorsbehalf.And, if an entire countrys Facebook is blocked, then most likely both Facebook and Facebook at Work will temporarily be taken down in that country as well. Shutdowns like these, to be fair, have been rare, and companies like Telenor will continue to have backup options for communicating with employees should Facebook at Work get barred in this way. (In its case, Telenor has Sharepoint, Brekketells me.)Looking forward, Codorniousays that Facebook will be adding an increasing number of features to Facebook at Work after is launches out of beta later this year. This will include actually asking people to pay to use the product, which for now is still being offered to businesses free of charge.Charging will also lead Facebookto launch new services, to justify paying for the product.Facebook at Work will continue to add features that give it parity with the core Facebook product one notable example is the Work Chat app that Facebookreleased earlier this year, which essentially is a version of Messenger for those using Facebook at Work; another is the addition of Reactions, the super-charged Like button that was finally rolled out globally last week, which was also added to Facebook at Work at the same time.But its not clear if the parityfeature set will be priced as a premium. More likely will be Facebooks bigger platform play, where it will give users access to integrations with other apps for an additional fee, and thiswill be charged per user and per month, Codorniou said.He added that Facebook is already in discussions with Quip (the cloud-based word processing app co-founded by Facebooks ex-CTO and in use by FB globally), as well as Dropbox and Box, and he also mentioned Microsofts Office 365 as another popular app Facebook would want to integrate.This would be on top of integrations that Codorniou says have already been added as Phase 1, which include identity management tools such as those offered by Okta to ease the sign-in process.
