Hi, Im John and I am super pumped to be TechCrunchs new summer writing intern. As a venture-capital-obsessed Michigan Wolverine, Im thrilled to be thawing out in the startup mecca of SOMA, San Francisco.I hail from Montgomery County, Maryland, where my belief in youth rights and public education brought me on the Montgomery County Board of Education (shout-out to fellow SMOB alums turned technologists: Shervin Pishevar and Tim Hwang!) My first tech gig was consulting my elementary school teachers on how to play Bill Nye VHS tapes. I dropped my first seed investment (undisclosed) on a group of ambitious middle schoolers disrupting global lemonade-stand sales.One day I will uncover how humans work, how to manage my tabs and how to keep espresso from foaming over when mixing it with sparkling water.I enjoy stress-testing technology to its limits (RIP MacBook Pro 2007), creative cooking with rare botanicals and spontaneous adventures likespur-of-the-moment mountain climbing and late-night forest exploration.Please email me at john.mannes@techcrunch.com if you would like to chat or grab coffee.
