Ellen Pao not only lost on all counts of a high-profile sexual discrimination case earlier this year, but Judge Harold Kahn has officially ordered the interim Reddit CEO to pay more than a quarter of a million dollars in court costs to Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers this morning.The ruling was consistent with atentative orderfrom Judge Kahn last night. Both parties met at the San Francisco Superior Court to hash out the details this morning.This is a reduced amount from the$973,000 in court fees KPCB sought from Pao. A majority of those fees, $864,680, went toward expert witnesses. However, Pao and her lawyers filed court documents in May to dismiss the court fees, calling them excessive and claimed that they were made in bad faith.Judge Kahnagreed with the excessiveness of the fees and reduced them to $275,996.63 today to better reflect Paos resources.Pao had offered to drop an appeal of the original case if KPCB gave her $2.7 million for costs she incurred in court fees during the six-week trial. KPCB shot down that idea, calling it completely off.Kleiner Perkins expected this verdict today. Partner Christina Lee wrote in a statement to TechCrunch that the tentative ruling from earlier, recognizesthat our settlement offer was reasonable and made in good faith.Weve reached out to Paos lawyer, Alan Exelrod, for commentand will update you if we hear back.
