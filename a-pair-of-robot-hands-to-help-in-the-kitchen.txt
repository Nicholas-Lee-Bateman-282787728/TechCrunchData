While robots have long been relegated to harsh environments like deserts and nuclear waste dumps, now they will hit the harshest environment of all: your kitchen. By using two robotic arms from a company called ShadowRobotics, a company called Moley has created a robotic chef that can chop, stir, saut, and serve.Created by Mark Oleynik, the robotic arms are programmed to precisely replicate recipes. Its not totally automatic  you still have to lay the ingredients out in a specific way  but in a demo for the IBTimes it seems like the robot was an able and patient cook. It took 30 minutes to make a soup dish with no human intervention.It can even put dirty dishes in the sink.The robot isnt quite ready for your home kitchen. It requires a great deal of specific programming and can mimic the actions of a great chef but, sadly, cant taste the result. However if youre looking a recipe remade again and again in exactly the same way, this might fit the bill. I, for one, welcome our robotic chef overlords.
