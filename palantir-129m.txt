Palantirsoftware was reportedly used to track down Osama Bin Laden.Palantirs latest funding, which was disclosed in a Dec. 9 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, is part of a round that now totals almost $680 million. About $555 million of that was previously revealed in another SEC filing and put Palantir at a $20 billion valuation.Its difficult to pinpoint exactly how many rounds of funding Palantir has raised so far, but CrunchBase puts it at 16, with investors including Founders Fund (whose partners include Peter Thiel, a Palantir co-founder) and In-Q-Tel, a non-profit venture capital firm that invests in technology companies whose products can help the Central Intelligence Agency.Palantir keeps a low-profile and doesnt divulge a lot of information about clients, but according to a document obtained by TechCrunch earlier this year, it works with government organizations, finance companies, and legal research firms that need a way to quickly analyze massive troves of data and get results in natural language or straightforward visualizations.Its customers have included the Securities Investment Protection Corporation, which used Palantir software to find evidence that resulted in Bernie Madoffs conviction, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the Joint IED Defeat Organization.TechCrunch has contacted Palantir for more information about its latest funding.
