Meanwhile, Pentatonix, a musical a capella group on YouTube since 2012, gets10 million views each week. The most watched episode of 30 Rock on NBC  its series finale had 4.8 million viewers, while Ryan Higa, a comedian on YouTube, averages more than 9 million views each week.Then theres PewDiePie, one of the topYouTuberswho makes the mostawesomely odd gaming videos, drawing almost90 million views each week.My point isnt that these personalities will eventually replace premium content  there will always be a place in audiences hearts to watch someones eyes getting gouged out in Game of Thrones  but rather thatYouTubersand independentartistshave been commanding comparable audiences to premium content for a while now, and via a vastly different approach.When Alex Day  whom you probablystillhavent heard of  released his album on the same day as Justin Timberlakes latest album, 20/20 Experience,Alexdebuted higher on the iTunes charts than Justin Timberlake.Timberlake isnt going anywhere anytime soon, but Alex was able to dominate the charts because, despite not having as large a fan base as Timberlake, Alexs fans care deeply about him. They have a frequent window into his life via YouTube. So when he asked them for support by downloading his album, their response was immediate and immense.Stories like Alexs are not rare these days, and individuals amassing fanatically passionate audiences are occurring internationally, across cultures and market verticals.YY, a more than$3 billion market cap company built on live-streaming karaoke personalities and gamers,regularly seesfans donate hundreds of dollars for a virtual car or rose to appear onscreen.Twitch, now owned by Amazon, allows fans to subscribe, but streamers actually go off-site to find tools to allow their fan bases to donate one-offs and put messages onscreen.YouTube  huge props for this  is standing up for creators byfinally highlighting them to their subscribers on the mobile appafter crushing it in the last earnings report on watch time and mobile growth.Reddits recent mishapwas in a large part because of opposing views on how to take AMAs  when fans askdirectquestions to high-profile figures, from Snoop Dogg to President Obama to the next level.The common thread among all these companies is a recognition that fans respond better to genuine anddirectconnections toartistsand celebrities.With numerous services available Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Vine, Periscope that enableartiststo share more frequently the inner workings of their lives and minds, fans are savvier than ever, and they expect authenticity from those they adore.And they revolt spectacularly when this authenticity is absent.Whenartistsandcelebritiesdirectly interact with fans, audiences respond with higher support (in the case of the data below, financially) and exponentially higher engagement levels.We did a study among our top creators and found that as expected financially supportive fans engaged up to 100x more. What was interesting, though, was when creators made more posts and comments than the median, they received more than 200 percent more financial support.At the end of the day, the ability forartistsandcelebritieswith staggering audience reach to be able to directly connect with their fans truly opens a new level of interactivity andintimacy.Whats really exciting, though, is how this enables myriad sustainable niche creators who have fanatical supporters that are deeply passionate about whom they support.Ive seen this unfold over the past several months as more and more financial support is pouring in forartistsand creators who make educational content, comedy videos, music, web comics, gaming reviews, furry-friendly animation (!) and everything in-between.
