Nokias history asthe worlds biggest mobile phone makeris becoming adistant memory, but its not out of the gadget business just yet.To build out its health technology business,the company today announced that it has acquired Withings, makers ofsmart scales, activity trackers, and other health gadgets. Withings is based out of France, and with Nokia in Finland, the transaction was in euros: 170 million to be exact, or around $192 million in U.S. dollars.The deal is expected to close in Q3 of this year, with Withings becoming a part of Nokia Technologies. Its a decent return: Withings had raised just under $34 million, with investors including BPIFrance, Idinvest, Ventech and 360 Capital Partners.The deal is not only a sign of how Nokia still very much believesit more to do in theworld of gadgets, but a sign of howthe company is going back to its early playbook of building vertically integrated businesses. In this case, buying Withings is not just about the health trackers, blood pressure monitors, thermometers and other objects that consumers will buy, but the bigger business of connecting them and running a wider array of cloud-based services under the hood  otherwise known as the Internet of Things.We have said consistently that digital health was an area of strategic interest to Nokia, and we are now taking concrete action to tap the opportunity in this large and important market, said Rajeev Suri, president & CEO of Nokia, in a statement. With this acquisition,Nokia is strengthening its position in the Internet of Things in a way that leverages the power of our trusted brand, fits with our company purpose of expanding the human possibilities of the connected world, and puts us at the heart of a very large addressable market where we can make a meaningful difference in peoples lives.Notably, this is thefirst acquisition in years at Nokia thats focused on consumer tech: the last several, including the ingestion of Alcatel-Lucent, have been about building out its mobile back-end and networking businesses.Its also a smart move for another part of Nokias remaining business: its patents. Nokia may not be making as many new waves in mobile phone patents today as it did years ago, and while it continues to milk those for royalties with companies like Apple, Withings, it says, will also ensure the ongoing renewal of Nokia Technologies world class IPR portfolio.While IoT is a very low-margin business compared to other digital consumer services like mobile phones, Nokia notes that healthcare is one of the big opportunities, citing analysts forecasts of marketCAGR of 37%, making it the fastest growing health care segment from 2015-2020.Its also an acquisitionthat is tapping into another trend: were living longer and getting more and more conscious of our health, and in some cases were not actually getting healthier, with weight issues affecting a lot of our sedentary population, and other illnesses like diabetes growing in prevalence because of wider changes in our diets.Withings was co-founded by Eric Carreel and Cedric Hutchings in 2008, both of whom appear to be joining Nokia. It employs200 peopleinFrance, the U.S.and Hong Kong.Since we started Withings, our passion has been in empowering people to track their lifestyle and improve their health and wellbeing, said Cdric Hutchings, CEO of Withings. Were excited to join Nokia to help bring our vision of connected health to more people around the world.For its part, its interesting that Withings decided to sell, and to sell to a European tech giant that essentially is a non-player in the activity tracking/health tech business. In the wider market, there maystill be question marks over the wider potential forconnected devices like activity trackers. Companies like Fitbit have been growing, but slowly. Others like Jawbone have seen their valuations slashed while waiting for the market to really take off.The question now is whether Withings under Nokia will tap into whats already out there in terms of consumer interest, or whether they have what it takes to supercharge and lead it.
