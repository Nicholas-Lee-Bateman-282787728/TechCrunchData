So how does American politics get genuinely disrupted? According to Gavin Newsom, Californias current Lieutenant Governor and a leading candidatefor Californian Governor in 2018, we need to change the game itself.Rather than relying on populist politicians like Donald Trump, Newsom told me, America needs what hes calls the systemic change in which SiliconValley specializes. And the 2016 Presidential candidate who most appreciates this, Newsom insists, is Hillary Clinton. Marco Rubio, in contrast, Newsom argues, claims to understand systemic change, but doesnt really get it.As a lifelong Democrat, its probably no great surprise to learn that Newsom is super confident about 2016 delivering a Democratic candidate.More surprising, however, is Newsoms nostalgia for a competitive Republican party that isnt into what he calls self-destruction. The Republican partys xenophobic ideology, Newsom, insists, has undermined its long-term political viability. And this is bad for American democracy, he argues, because its in everyones interest  both Democrats and Republicans  to have a healthy two party system.<Many thanks to San Franciscos Innovation Hangarfor hosting this interview with the Lieutenant Governor.
