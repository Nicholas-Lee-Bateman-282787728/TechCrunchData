The folks responsible for the entries in the Associated Press Stylebookhave announced that the word Internet will no longer be uppercased, thus breaking my heart and making some of our writers very happy.The AP Stylebook, which many newspapers and websites (one word? really?) use to guide theirstyle efforts, defines Internet as a decentralized, worldwide network of computers that can communicate with each other. Its a pretty big definition and has warranted the glory of a capital I. But no more.And thats not all. The AP Stylebook has also decided to lowercase Web.We will lowercase internet effective June 1, when the 2016 Stylebook launches. #ACES2016 pic.twitter.com/nGz63zc5YP AP Stylebook (@APStylebook) April 2, 2016The changes, which werenot announced on April Fools Day, areto take effect on June 1 when the 2016 edition of the style guide is released. Then, and only then, will Internet join other inexplicable changes the style guide has made in the recent past, including more than versus over and underway versus under way, both of which still vex me.At least it still thinks literally means literally and not figuratively.
