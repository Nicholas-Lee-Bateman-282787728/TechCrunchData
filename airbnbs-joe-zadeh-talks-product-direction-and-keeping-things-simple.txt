Airbnbs had a busy summer. It rolled out an Apple Watch app, hit 1 million guests staying in an Airbnb in a single day, and over the summer Airbnb members hosted 17 million guests.But the company still has to ensure that it hires the right people whocontinue to scale upwhile keeping its products simple. We sat down with Airbnbs VP of product Joe Zadeh to find out more about the companys product development culture and where the company is right now.Zadeh leads Airbnbs product management team but also led cross-functional product-driven missions for the entire company. Hell interview everyone that ends up on the product management team, and then spends his other time working with cross-functional groups to move initiatives forward. One of his latest tasks, for example, is making the booking process really simple.The company now has around 300,000 instant booking listings, Zadeh said. Hosts need to have confidence that they can trust guests, so they are working tomake the process as frictionless as possible. Airbnbs worked on tools like personalization for hosts. Airbnbs algorithms, for example, can understand if hosts prefer long stays over short stays.The whole product development processstarts with hiring people whocan grow as fast if not faster than the company. What works today is not going to work a year from now, Zadeh said, meaning Airbnb has to be careful that each person they hire can keep up with how the company changes over time.Its still in its infancy but its a great tool to keep people connected with less friction, Zadeh said. We didnt do the watch just to do the watch. Its in service for the human connection.
