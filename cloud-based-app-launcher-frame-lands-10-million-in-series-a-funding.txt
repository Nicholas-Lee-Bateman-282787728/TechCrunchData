Frame, a cloud-based service that allows users to run desktop programs like Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Excel directly from their browser, just announced that it has closed a $10 million Series A funding round.Columbus Nova Technology Partners, Bain Capital Ventures and SQN Venture Partners participated in the round. The three-year-old Frame, formerly Mainframe2, had just recently landed $2.5 million in seed funding this past November.In a statement announcing the funding, Dr. Nikola Bozinovic, Frames founder and CEO, said:In 2012, we set out to change the way people think about personal computing. Today we are taking a significant step toward realizing that goal by letting anyone with the Internet connection access his own cloud computer. We are thrilled to have the strategic support from our investors to help us in our mission.Bozinovic said that the newly raised funds will help the company scale quickly, as it prepares for the launch of a newpublic beta of its app, which delivers graphics apps from the cloud directly into any browser with no plug-ins required.Bozinovic believes the service, with plans starting at $10 per month, is an ideal fit for users with devices like the new MacBook, which pack less computing power than previous models but sport unmatched mobility.Just as cloud-technologies like Dropbox have allowed users to store their files without needing large hard discs, Frame hopes to further enable mobile users by allowing them to essentially outsource their computing power and run graphics-intensive applications inside a browser.Frames potential to change the landscape of end-user computing is immense, saidMohsenMoazami, managing director of Columbus Nova Technology Partners. Our investment will help the company continue to grow toward its goal of fundamentally transforming the way applications are managed and delivered from the cloud.Frame plans to drop anew public beta on its site,fra.me, on July 8.
