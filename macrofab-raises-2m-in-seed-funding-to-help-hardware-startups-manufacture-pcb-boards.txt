MacroFab, a platform to helphardware startups prototype and manufacture PCB boards, has raised a $2 million seed round led by Techstars Ventures.Any company thathas worked with manufacturers to produce PCB boards knows how hardit can be.The process is old fashioned and time intensive, with lots of back and forth between the manufacturer and client. Prototyping PCBs is also very expensive, as companies will charge a substantial premium for just producing one or two test boards.MacroFab provides a solution to this problem with acloud-based platform that allows users to quickly upload a PCB board design, get an instant quote, and have the boardprinted in MarcoFabs factory.The company has access toan inventory of over 250,000 electronic components, and uses a pricing/risk matrix to suggest what part should be used in your board. For example, if you are only producing a few prototype boards, the platform will suggest that you use a less expensive brandthan would be needed for mass production.Chris Church, founder of MacroFab, explained that the company has a unique approach to one-off prototype orders that lets them be much less expensive than the competition.Specifically, MacroFabs software will consolidate multiple prototyping orders into one large job, so the setup costs can be shared amongmany customers.About half of the companys current orders are for a small quantity of test boards, while the other half are larger orders for mass-produced versions.MacroFab also has a full-service API, which lets companies receive quotes and placeorders without ever visitingthe MacroFab site.Church said the company will use the new funding to bolster its R&D staff, and add new features to the platform.
