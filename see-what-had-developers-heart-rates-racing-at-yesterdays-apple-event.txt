Turns out developerswere in pretty heavy anticipation of seeing Tim Cook take thestage at yesterdays Hey Siri event, but some new featuresgot thema little more excited than others.A fewof the developers and beta testers for a heart-monitoring Apple Watch app called Cardiogram wore their devices in workout mode during yesterdays event and what were the results?It seemsthattheApple Pencil really had developershearts racing. Outside that, the watchOS launch date and the Airstrip demoreally piquedtheir interests. Check out some of the partial data from the event below.Go toCardiogramssite for full data from their app.I chatted withBrandon Ballinger who works attheUCSF Health eHeart Studyand helped buildCardiogram for the Apple Watch.Cardiogram lets you chart and analyze all that Apple Watch heart rate data sitting around in the Health app. Many of our users use it for running or cycling,Brandon Ballinger told TechCrunch in an email.Ballinger says that the mission of the app is to help keep people more informed about their heart health.We think the Apple Watch can be used to create something similar to a check engine light for your heart. Almost all of these conditions are treatable or sometimes even curable. Ballinger said. When you have a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia, your watch should tell you, connect you with medical care, and help you get it fixed. You shouldnt find out about a treatable arrhythmia by coming to the emergency room with a stroke.Cardiogram is currently live in the App Store and will be starting a private beta forAndroid Wear in the near future.
