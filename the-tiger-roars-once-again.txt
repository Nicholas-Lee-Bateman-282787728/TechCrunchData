November looks to be an auspicious month for power investor Tiger Global. The New York-based hedge fund raised $2.5 billion for new deals back in November 2014, and now, after a spending spree that has seen it put more than$1 billion intoover 50 companies in 2015 alone,a regulatory filing shows that the firm reloaded its coffers with $2.5 billion in capitalon November 30.The ever-secretive Tiger Global  which doesnt even operate a website  had its plans for last years fundraising leaked out, but this years cash allocation is less clear.We contacted the firmfor information about its plans, but had not received a reply at the time of writing. (We dont expect to, either.)This year has been a notable one for Tiger Global in a few ways. Itlost two top executivesearlier this year, leaving Lee Fixel as the sole head of its private equity business.Noteworthy, too, has beenthePE funds push intoIndia under the tutelage of Fixel.It had completed 18 investmentsin India as of this summer, as this YourStory article explained, and its localportfolio includes an impressive array of Indias fastest growing young companies  such as e-commerce unicorn Flipkart,Uber rival Ola, delivery firm Grofers, Shopclues,robotics startup Grey Orange, media company Inshorts, and music streaming service Saavn.But Tiger Global isnt just about India. It has spent big outsideof the South Asia country, too, backingAmazon rival Jet.com, Postmates,Credit Karma, Airbnb and numerous others  as detailed in its long, long Crunchbase entry.While the exact plan for this new capital isnt clear, it isnt too hard to guess.Tiger Global was early to India, and it seems certainthat a large swathe of thisnew capital will go towards doubling down on its most recent bets and sleuthing out new investment opportunities inthe country, where the economy continues togrowand the startup ecosystem increasingly rivals the U.S. for attention.Much like SoftBank, which has also gone hard on India and the rest of Asia, Tiger Global has backed other high value international startups across the world  including, outside of the U.S., Uber rivals Didi Kuaidi in China and GrabTaxi in Southeast Asia  so we can expect more of this same asit seeks out similar investment opportunities worldwide, and doubles down on its existing bets.Tiger Globals raising of new capital comes hot on the heels of Fidelity Capitals decision to mark up its shares in a range of companies including Dropbox and Snapchat, as Fortune reported. Just weeks prior to that, it emerged that Fidelityhad written down the value of those same two investments alongside others. In other words, these private company valuations arepretty fluid and firms like Fidelity and Tiger Global will valuethem as theychoose when theychoose to.
