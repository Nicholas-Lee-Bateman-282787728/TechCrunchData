TechCrunch Radio is going down tonight (just like it does every Tuesday) and well, we need you.If youre a startup looking to get publicity or build awareness, the TC Radio Pitch-Off is just the ticket. We offer entrepreneurs the opportunity to apply to be in the pitch-off and those selected are given 60 seconds exactly to pitch their product to the world (and a panel of expert judges including myself, John Biggs, and a special mystery guest from the VC world).Five companies compete every week, and only one is crowned the winner after a live, on-radio deliberation.But TC Radio is about much more than the fierce battle of pitching startups. John Biggs and I also discuss the most important tech news from the week at the top of the hour, and encourage listeners to call in and discuss these topics with us.Is any of this interesting to you?If you want to be a part of the pitch-off, follow the instructions below.
