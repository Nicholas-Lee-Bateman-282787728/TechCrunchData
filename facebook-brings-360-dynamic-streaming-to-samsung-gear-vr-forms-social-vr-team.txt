Zuck shocked everyone by appearing on stage forthe Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event for MWC 2016. He wasnt there to push Samsungs new phones or talk about Messenger, his time onstage was all about virtual reality.Zuckerberg revealed that Facebook (which, in case if youve forgotten, is the parent company of Oculus) will be bringing its dynamic streaming technology for 360 video to Gear VR (which, in case if youve forgotten, is powered byOculus).This technology allows significant performance upgrades to streaming content by only playing back whats in view of the headset at any given time rather than processing the entire 360 sphere of video at once.All of this is done by seamlessly switching between dozens of variants of each 360 video taken frommultipleangles.Facebook revealed more about the technology at its Video @Scale event last month.The results speak for themselves, Facebook says their efforts have quadrupled the resolution quality of 360 streaming video in VR by reducing the amount of required network bandwidth by 4x.Anotherinteresting tidbit comes from a Facebook blog post todaytheyre building a social VR teamto focus entirely on exploring the future of social interaction in VR.This team will explore how people can connect and share using todays VR technology, as well as long-term possibilities as VR evolves into an increasingly important computing platform. Theyll will work closely with Oculus and other teams at Facebook to build the foundation for tomorrows social VR experiences on all platforms.Facebook and Samsung partnering closer together can only mean good things for both companies right now. Samsung has offered Facebook and Oculus a connection point to more causal VR consumers through their widespread mobile ecosystem. With Oculuss Rift hitting shelves at $599 and requiring a hefty gaming PC to boot, chances are limited that many will have immediate access to that brand of virtual reality. The $99 Gear VR, on the other hand, is bound to be the first step in getting consumers intrigued andcomfortable with the technology.
