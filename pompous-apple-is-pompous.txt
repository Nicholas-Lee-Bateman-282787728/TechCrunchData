Apples latest iPhone ad is a bit smug. Even for Apple. As you can see above, the ad takes the fight directly to Android phones by reminding that Apple makes both the iPhone hardware and software  something very few phone makers can say.Its effective, really.Chances are few general consumers are aware that Apple is effectively alone in building a smartphone in this way. Its worth pointing out.But as a counter, Samsung, Google and others could point out that by building different parts of their smartphones, they can focus more of their energy on specific parts than if they built the entire thing.
