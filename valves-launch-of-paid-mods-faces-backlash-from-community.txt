PC gaming giant Valve is facing vocal backlash from its community a day after giving developers of game modifications the ability to charge for their work on the Steam platform.The feature, which launched for 2011s Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, lets fans of games introduce new items, characters, environments, or even gameplay rules in exchange for a few bucks. Said fans have already been doing so for free for years, but now theres monetary incentive to keep going  or even invest more time than previously made sense.Whereas digital stores typically take a fraction of the sales they process  say, Apples 30% on app sales an in-app puchases  Valve has decided to take 75% from each sale of paid mods. That amount is then split between Valve and the publisher or developer behind the original game.That split is one of the sticking points emerging as an issue in Reddit threads and posts on the Steam Community, but its certainly not the only one, as many understand its a prerequisite to get studios interested in letting others profit from the games they make.If you dig into the complaints made by modders, most discuss the ill-effects the option could have on the broader PC game modding scene. This post by Steam user FilthyCasual (and the 200+ responses) hits many of the major pain points:Earlier today, the paid mods available for Skyrim were temporarily made unavailable, leading some to speculate that Valve was already pulling the feature based on the backlash from the community. Those downloads have since been restored, though weve reached out to Valve for clarification on whether the downtime was a bug or the result of backend changes to the platform.
