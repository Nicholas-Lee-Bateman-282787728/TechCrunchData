Twitter is expanding its analytics product with the launch of what its calling the Twitter Brand Hub.Even though its a tool for Twitter advertisers, the Brand Hubseems less focused on specific ads or campaigns and more on the broader conversation around different brands and products  though of course that data could help businessessee where they needto boost their visibility with ads.For example, Twitter introduced a TrueVoice metric, which represents how much of the social media conversation is about a given brand, comparedto their competitors. Heres how the company says it measures this: We determine your brands TrueVoice by first analyzing Tweets about your brand and those about your competitors. Then, we identify what percentage of these impressions your brand owns.Many initiatives from Twitter and Facebook have focused on tracking whether the ads drive sales and conversations. TheBrand Hub, on the other hand, presents more traditional brand advertising metrics. It also places a big emphasis on impressions, not just tweets or engagements, which could helpTwitter remind advertisersthat a single tweet can have a big impact if its seen by enough people.The companysays its currently making the Brand Hub available to large and medium advertisers in English-speaking countries.
