One of the most asked questions about the Oculus Rift is when are we getting them? and the founder of the company continues to update those who are waiting patiently.According to a series of tweets from Palmer Luckey, the Rift is on-target to ship in Q1.@PalmerLuckey Preorders are coming soon after new year. Enjoy a stress-free holiday, we won't launch preorders without warning! Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) December 22, 2015This comes after developers had a note in their inbox letting them know about early builds of the hardware being shipped out to them. So yes, its on like virtual Donkey Kong.The updates are important, since there are literally markets, companies (Facebook!), fans, and those generally interested in virtual reality hinging their future plans on the availability of Oculus first consumer offering. The company continues to announce exclusive titles, which is exciting, but has the VR community fearful of Oculus going rogue and leaving them in the dust without an open platform to develop on. That wont happen.The gaming industry, because it kind of stems out of some of the stuff that was done in VR first, has kind of been building all of the infrastructure needed for VR. We have game engines that run at high frame rate. We have game engines that are made to render tons of 3D objects that are very photorealistic as fast as possible. If we didnt have those things and if we didnt have the game industry, VR would never be able to work remotely as well as it does.All of that hard work means that theres way, way more to come. And it sounds like Oculus will handily beat HTCs Vive to the consumer market. That would be a massive win for Facebook and Oculus.
