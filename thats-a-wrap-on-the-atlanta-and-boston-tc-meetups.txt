This week, TechCrunch had its world rocked by two very special cities on the East Coast.First we hit up Atlanta, where we felt true Southern Hospitality as ten startups pitched a packed audience at Prive night club. After a fierce debate, our expert panel of judges crowned Carlingo the winner, but not before we caught up with Yik Yak on stage. Carlingo is a service that handles the negotiation portion of car buying and selling.Second place in Atlanta went to teamup, with the audience choice award going to Borrowed by Design.Then we visited Boston where we packed the house and CliqueChic took home the first place prize with a members-only luxury shopping experience online.Neumitra, a service that helps measure and manage brain health and performance, took home second place in Boston, with Lettuce (a Tinder for restaurants) nabbing the audience choice. Oh, and Lettuce founder Andre Borczuk used his sixty seconds to rap about his startup, which obviously went over quite well. You can check out his rap pitch here.
