Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg committed to turning on Safety Check in more human disasters going forward, responding to criticism that the companyturned on its safety feature for Paris but not for Beirut and other bombings.Zuckerberg explained that the Paris terror attacksmarkedthe first time the company has enabled Safety Checkfor a human disaster, not a natural disaster like an earthquake. The featureallows people in a region affected by a crisis to send a notification totheir Facebook friends that says they are safe.AsFacebook profile pictures are updatedwith French flags and Paris users check in, many have questioned why the same support has not been extended to Beirut, where more than 40 people died in bombings the day before the attacks in Paris.You are right that there are many other important conflicts in the world, Zuckerberg wrote in a comment on Facebook. We care about all people equally, and we will work hard to help people suffering in as many of these situations as we can.Zuckerberg wrote in a comment on his picture that Facebooks policy just changed on Friday to allow the feature to be used in a human disaster, and going forward it will be used in more.An early form of Safety Checkfirst launched in 2011 during Tokyos tsunami and nuclear disaster. It has since been launched during earthquakes in Afghanistan, Nepal and Chile as well as duringTropical Cyclone Pam in the South Pacific and Typhoon Ruby in the Philippines. However, Facebook says the feature in its current form cannot be applied to all crises.In the case of natural disasters, we apply a set of criteria that includes the scope, scale and impact, wrote Alex Schultz, vice president of growth. During an ongoing crisis, like war or epidemic, Safety Check in its current form is not that useful for people: because there isnt a clear start or end point and, unfortunately, its impossible to know when someone is truly safe.'Facebook said it chose to enable the feature in Paris because it noticed a lot of activity on the ground. So far the company has received positive feedback  as it should. It was reassuring on Friday as news reports were coming in to see friends in Paris checking in as safe.This activation will change our policy around Safety Check and when we activate it for other serious and tragic incidents in the future, Schultz wrote.Schultzalso wrote that it would explore more ways for people to show support for things they care about through their Facebook profiles, responding to criticism thata French flag instant profile picture was available but not a Lebanese flag option.Especiallynow that Facebookboasts more than a billion daily active usersaround the world, the criticism reinforces the companys need to maintain a global perspective  not just a Western one.
