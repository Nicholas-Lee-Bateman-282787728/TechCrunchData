Its no street view for cats, but Googles newly launched Street View mobile app does promise to make it easier to explore Google Maps immersive, 360-degree imagery as well as contribute yourown photos toimprove the overall Google Maps experience.The app, which is actually an update and rebrand of Googles older Photo Sphere Camera, combines the same feature set that was available previously, which included the ability to create panoramic photo spheres and share them back to Google Maps, along with new features, like an improvedability to explore photo spheres shared by others as well as browse through Google Street View collections.As you may recall, Google introduced the Photo Sphere Camera just over a year ago, with the goal of giving users a fun tool to take panoramic photos, while also offering Google a way to tap into that user-generated contentfor its own purposes.However, that app ended up having niche appeal  after all, there were already a number of third-party tools for taking panoramicphotos, and iOS itself includes a panoramic photo feature, too. The app is currently ranked #363 in the Photo & Video category on the iTunes App Store. Or, in other words, it hasnt been a breakout hit.For comparisons sake, Google Maps is the #8 most downloaded iOS app of all time.Thats why it makes sense thatGoogle isnow attempting to leverage its better-known Maps brand and the popular Street View feature with this apps makeover.With the Street View app, users can do more than just snap their own panoramic photos and share them back to Google or to online communities. They can also explore the photo spheres others have taken from around the world right alongside Googles own Street View Collections. (Before, you could only view others photo spheres.)This makes the app, previously more of a specialized camera with photo-sharing features, something that could inch into the utilities space where it could see more regular use.After all, while it may be fun to virtually explore the world  like byscalingthe rock wall El Capitan in Yosemite or by hiking Mt. Fuji, as Google suggests  it also seems to be a practical tool for just scoping out a new location youre planning to visit, without being weighed down by all the extraneous features found in the flagship Google Maps app.In addition to letting you shoot panoramic photos using your smartphone, the updated Street View map also works with newer, spherical cameras like the Ricoh Theta Sor NCTech iris360, notes Google. These cameras may not appeal to all users, as 360-degree photos and videos arentexactly an everyday need. But they may make sense for those looking for simpler, more portable solutions for recording 360-degree shots without needing complicated camera arrays like aGoPro rig.The updated Street View appis live nowon iTunes and Google Play.
