Self-driving drone Lily has had quite the success in sales and its not even on the market yet. The startup pulled in a whopping $34 million in pre-orders by the end of 2015, with 60,000 units already sold.While thats not as massive asApple Watch pre-sales (1.2 million sold in the first day), its still a pretty good indicator Lily is onto something.The little flying bot is pretty cute with its rounded style and smizing blue LED lights. The 10.29-inch-wide by 3.22-inch-tall device can fly 50 feet up and comes equipped with a 1080p HD camera.Lily acts as a robot videographer, automatically following you anywhere. It starts recording videos as soon as you toss it into the air and is even waterproof, should you want to take it to the pool.A small tracking device lures Lily along as it uses technological wizardry to find the perfect shot.But dont call Lily a drone. Its a camera, co-founder and CEO of the company Antoine Balaresque corrected me as he gave me a demo of the drone camera in the lobby of the Courtyard Marriott in downtown Las Vegas during CES. How does the FAA feel about that? As an unmanned aircraft, the device still must meet FAA licensing standards (because its a drone).Balaresque and I chatted about Lilys unique features and his successful pre-order campaign on camera.
