Another parliamentary committee that has been scrutinizing UKsurveillance legislation currently before parliamentsayschanges are needed to remove concerns the Investigatory Powers Billwould affordstate security agencies powers that are too broad.However the Human Rights Committee isgenerally less critical of the controversial bill than the security-cleared Intelligence and Security Committee,concluding that the controversial bulk powers the government is seeking to enshrine in laware not, in and of themselves, incompatible with European Human Rights law  at least not if certain legal bases are properly established, and checks and balances built in. It says it is basing this assessment on current case law.On the current state of the ECHR case-law, we do not consider the bulk powers in the Bill to be inherently incompatible with the right to respect for private life, but capable of being justified if they have a sufficiently clear legal basis, are shown to be necessary, and are proportionate in that they are accompanied by adequate safeguards against arbitrariness, it writes.It does also note that other legal challenges to bulk powers are pending. Whether the powers have a sufficiently clear legal basis and the adequacy of the safeguards are closely intertwined questions on which the courts will rule in due course, and we do not express a view pending the determination of those legal challenges, it adds.Late lastmonth theUKgovernment agreed to an independent review of the IP Bills bulk powers something the opposition Labour Party had been calling for appointing QC David Anderson to the task:itspreviousreviewer of terrorism legislation, whose earlier report paved the way for the IP bill to be drafted.The Human Rights Committee saysit supports thisplanned review of bulk powers, and recommends Andersonshould report before the bill completes its passage through parliament  as youd hope, if the review is to have any impact on the proposed legislation.Critics, includingprivacy and human rights groups,continue todescribe bulk collection powers as mass surveillance  arguing they areinherently disproportionate. While, at the European level, bulk collectionlegislationwasoverturned by the European Court of Justice, back in April 2014 which alsojudged bulk intercept powers ascontravening fundamental privacy and human rights.More recently the US-EU Safe Harbor agreement, which had governed transatlantic data flows for some fifteen years, was struck down by Europes supreme court on the grounds that US government surveillance programs were breaching Europeans privacy rights.Yet despite the wider legal climate in European having turnedagainst bulk collection programs, the Human Rights Committee appears convinced bulk powers can beproportionate/non-arbitrary given the right checks and balances.The UK governments independent reviewer of terrorism legislation also supported continued use by the security and intelligence agencies of bulk collection powers in his June 2015 report but again with caveats thatstrict additional safeguards be provided for in the associated legislation, such as, for example, judicial authorization of intercept warrants.It remains to be seen what Andersons view will be of bulk powers now that he will beassessingthem in the specific legislative context of the IP bills proposed framework.Too broadly draftedDespite supporting bulk powers (with caveats), the Human Rights committee does make some specific criticisms ofthe bill,flaggingup issues other critics have also identified as problematic.One major concern for the committeeis the bills provision for so-called thematic warrants, where an intercept warrant can be obtained to capture data associated with multiple targets.We recognise the value of thematic warrants but consider that the wording of the clauses concerning the subject matter of targeted interception and targeted equipment interference warrants is too broadly drafted, itwrites in a summary of its report.We recommend that the Bill be amended so as to ensure that the description in the warrant is sufficiently specific to enable any person unknown, but who is the subject of it, to be identified and to prevent the possibility of large numbers of people being potentially within the scope of a vaguely worded warrant.It is also worried about powers that would enable targeted warrants to be modified after the fact  which it says might offer a route to circumvent judicial approval (the latter being a key recommendation of Andersons prior report  and one which the government partially adopted, albeit retaining ministerial authorizationin a so-called double lock mechanism).We consider that the power to make modifications to warrants for targeted interception, without judicial approval, is so wide as to give rise to real concern that the requirement of judicial authorisation can be circumvented, thereby undermining that important safeguard against arbitrariness. We recommend that major modifications to warrants require approval by a Judicial Commissioner, the committeewrites.On the human rights law point, the committee suggests the new legal framework the governmentis seeking to establish with the IP bill could be made more compatible with the requirements of European Human Rights law if the oversight system provides for a clear separation of function between the prior judicial authorisation of warrants and ex post inspection and review.We recommend that the Investigatory Powers Commissioner be placed under a duty to ensure that the two distinct functions of authorisation and inspection are carried out by different Commissioners, it adds.Other concerns for the committee include ensuring robust protections for journalists sources; for the communications of members of parliament; and the privileged communications of the legal profession.Update:Responding to the report in a statement provided to TechCrunch, digital rights group Privacy International welcomed the committees assessment ofthematic warrants astoo broad but added that thegeneral viewthatbulk collection isnot inherently incompatible with privacy rights is out of step with recent decisions from the ECHR.The Committees remarks that bulk collection is not inherently incompatible with the right to privacy based on existing case law, is like a sand castle built at low tide. The landscape of the case law in this area is set to change and has been changing rapidly, said PIs advocacy officer Matthew Rice.Recent decisions from the European Court of Human Rights in Zakharov, and by the Court of Justice of the European Union have been clear in condemning the practice of collecting, in bulk, the communications of individuals without sufficient limitations. And the upcoming cases involving UK human rights organisations will change the nature of case law in Europe. While this scrutiny is welcomed, on this point, the committee may find itself reviewing its opinion again.
