Facebook is quietly testing a new feature that will direct users to the best-rated and reviewed local service providersin their area. At the easy-to-access URL Facebook.com/services, the social network has compiled a searchable directory of professional service providers, like contractors, painters, plumbers, doctors offices, auto repair techs, child care providers, pet groomers, salons, event planners, decorators, and much more. The effort is similar to both Amazon and Googles recent moves to connect customers with home and local service providers, in an effort to unseat industry giants like Angies List and Yelp by leveraging both thestrength and broad reach of their respectiveplatforms.The new feature was first spotted by the blog Search Engine Land, following a tip from another site.Whats interesting is that while Amazon and Google have both been targetingthe fragmented home services market  Amazon with the launch of its own nationwideHome Services destination in March, and Google with an extension toAdWords as its angle into the space Facebooks effort expands beyond local pros to include other types of businesses, too.The site itself is simply laid out, with a search box for the categoryof business you want to research. It also defaults to your current location, pulling in a background image of the city in question. The site is only available on the desktop, though Facebook does offer a way to find local businesses on mobile through the Nearby Places feature at the bottom of its navigation, below Events, Groups, Pages, Apps, and more.Currently, theFacebook.com/services page, at first glance, only seems to highlight area service providers like spas, business services, automotive services, pet services, and more  all of which are featured as thumbnail images above the larger directory of professional services below. (There are over 80 business types that are linked in this directory, but there are even more available via the search box.)However, as youll discover when you actually type into the search box on the site, youre able to query up all sorts of local businesses  including those you may have otherwise searched for on sites like Yelp  such as restaurants, bars, or nightclubs, for example. Or you can search for travel-related businesses like hotels, or tours and sightseeing. Basically, the site includes nearly anybusiness that has a Facebook Page, it seems.After performing a search, business information is provided thanks to the data Facebook already has from the businesses Pages, including details like their description, phone number, hours of operation, location, and ratings and reviews. Its unclear at this time how Facebook is ranking the search results, as its clearly taking more than ratings alone into play. That is, higher-rated businesses which havemore ratings and reviews than others arent necessarily at the top of the list.That could mean that Facebook is using other data it knows about the logged-in user, like whether theyve visited the Page, rated the business, have liked the page, or had friends who liked the page, and so on. But thats all just speculation for the time being. (Weve asked Facebook if it could clarify how this works,and will update if more information is provided.)The search results page also shows where the businesses are located on a map, which means that Facebook could potentially even eat into Googles territory as well, at least asa research tool for finding nearby businesses and service providers.Its not surprising to see Facebook move into this area. After all, the company has a treasure trove of business data on its site.Earlier this month, Facebook said it had over 50 million active business Pageson its social network, which is up from 40 million this April. And it has been expanding the features available to business owners, rolling out everything from Buy buttonsand other calls-of-action to most recently, new communication tools that make it easier for customersto chat with businessesand see how quickly they respond.Based on some brieftests, it appears that Facebooks Services site is not limited to the U.S., as we were able to search for businesses across Asia, Europe and elsewhere.Facebook was not immediately available for comment.Update: Facebook offered the following comment: Were in the early stages of testing a way for people to easily find more Pages for the services theyre interested in.
