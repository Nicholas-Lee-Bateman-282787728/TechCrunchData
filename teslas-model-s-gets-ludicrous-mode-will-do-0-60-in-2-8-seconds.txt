Teslas Model S P85D is well known for its wonderfully named Insane mode, which tunes the car to go from 0 to 60 in 3.1 seconds.Not insane enough for you? Now the Model S is getting a Ludicrous mode. Seriously.The aptly named Ludicrous mode will do 0-60 in 2.8 seconds. According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, that acceleration pins you to the seat at a 1.1 Gs. Its faster than falling, he adds. Its like having your own private roller coaster.One catch: unlike most Tesla Model S tuning enhancements, this one isnt a software update  and its not free. Why? Because Tesla had to make new, physical hardware to make this possible. Specifically, they had to make a fuse that didnt melt when you pulled ridiculously high amperages over it.The fuse upgrade will be a $10k option for new buyers, and cost $5k (before installation) for existing P85D owners.
Musk also announced two other bits of news surrounding the Model S:Also mentioned in passing were very limited details on Teslas electric SUV  the Model X  and their more affordable compact option, the Model 3. The first Model Xs will ship in two months, while Elon promises Model 3s will roll out in just over two years.(Fun note: before the press call began, Tesla had Ludacris playing on loop  now we know why. How very Apple-y of them.)
