Facebook has launcheda new initiative that will helpits employees sample the experience of using its social networkon slow mobile internet connections, as is the case for hundreds of millions of its users who live inemerging markets.Dubbed 2G Tuesdays, the program allows Facebook staff to slow their mobile internet speed down to 2G for an hour, as Business Insider first reported. It is entirely optional and doesnt last the fullday, but itwill let staff whodont get to travel muchto gain a better understanding of the issues that users in far-flung countriesface.Given thatnearly one billion of Facebooks monthly active users live outside of the U.S. and Europe, you can argue that thisnew initiative isnt just smartits essential.Thats becauseusing Facebook on a 2G connection can belike using an entirely different service, but you wouldnt necessarily be fully aware of that unless 2G was the only option you had.People are coming online at a staggering rate in emerging markets and, in most cases, are doing so on mobile via 2G connections. But on the lower end of 2G networks, it can take about two minutes to download a webpage. We need to understand how people use Facebook in different internet connections in all parts of the world so we can build the best experience for them, a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch via email.Facebooksengineering director Tom Alison toldBusiness Insider that 2G internet speedsdefinitely tested my patience it felt like parts of the product were just broken.That kind of enlightenment is exactly what Facebook wants those building its products and services to gain.Ever conscious of its global user base,Facebook launched a stripped down version of its service for Android users in emerging markets this summer, and last year it revamped its main Android app to make smaller and more efficient. The U.S. firmdoes also, of course, offer its Internet.org service for emerging markets, too.
