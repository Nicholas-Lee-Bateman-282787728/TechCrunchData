Refinery29, a media companycatering to a younger, female demographic, has today launched its first-ever mobile application, called Refinery29 This AM. The idea with the new application is to deliver a round-up of curated news stories to readers, meant to be viewedfirst thing in the morning. Says the company, these stories will be presented on eight different cards in the app, and will focus on topics including world events, celebrity news, politics and fashion.The pared-down selection in the app, versus the breadth of content available on Refinery29s website, gives Refinery29 This AM more focus, andbetter positions it to become a part of users daily routines, the company believes.That is, the apps content is able to be digested fairly quickly. Users can choose to go in-depth if they want to by clicking a link to view the longer article, but they can also just use Refinery29 This AM to flip through cards that feature a headline and summary of that same linked content.That makes the app seem more competitive with something like NowThis News, for example, which similarly tries to deliver top headlines and summaries to readers across platforms and social media.And while the Refinery29 This AM appmay sound, at first blush, like something that would also compete with the companys presence in Snapchat Discover, the type of content provided bythe app is notably different from whats directed at the Snapchat audience.For instance, todays Snapchat content includes storiesabout new nail polish trends, makeup tips, Netflix recommendations, and more, set to jazzy, upbeat music. Meanwhile, the AM app presents a selection that includes real news  like Boko Harams burning of homes in Nigeria andthe spread of the Zika virus in Colombia, alongside pop culture stories like one involving last nights Grease Live and Netflixs Gilmore Girls reunion.The company tells us that the app will refresh with new stories every day at 6:00 AM ET, Monday through Friday, but the weekend edition will remain the same on both Saturday and Sunday.Content that refreshes on a schedule has been tried before, with mixed results. Today, Yahoos News Digest app updates in the morning and evening with new stories, but the app is floundering in the 70s and 80s in iOSs News category. It does a little better on Android  ranked in the 50s through 70s, generally, in the News & Magazines category.Meanwhile, an earlier experiment  News Corps iPad-only newspaper The Daily did something similar, but ended up shutting down.Other news summary services have been doingbetter. For example, the daily newsletter theSkimmreported reaching 1.5 million subscribers as of August.The challenge for Refinery29 is that it has to getusers to actually make launching the app a part of their daily routine. This is promptedby way of push notifications, which can tend to get annoying. While they can be disabled, doing so could have users forgetting about the app entirely.In Refinery29s favor, however, is that the app is built outof the companys popular web franchise, 8 Things To Know This AM, which already has a readership familiar with its headline round-ups. The company says that transforming the series into a standalone app was a natural way to meet its mobile audiences needs.Mobile content consumption has been a strong area of growth for Refinery29 and we are always testing new ways to reach and engage our audience. The app is an opportunity to take one of our most successful content series, 8 Things to Know This AM, and package it into a format that our audience is demanding as they are spending less and less time on desktop.Plans to invest more in distribution via mobile were also a part of the companys goals following its 2015 Series D raise of $50 million from Scripps Networks and WPP.Today, Refinery29 claims over 100 million monthly viewers across platforms, 25 percent of which are from desktop. However, the company also tells us that its mobile footprint is already quite strong: 63 percent ofusers come to the site via mobile, and 2 in 3 only accessed the site on mobile instead of desktop in December.Mobile content consumption has been a strong area of growth for Refinery29 and we are always testing new ways to reach and engage our audience. The app is an opportunity to take one of our most successful content series, 8 Things to Know This AM, and package it into a format that our audience is demanding as they are spending less and less time on desktop, a spokesperson explained of the new releaseThe app was created in-house using React Native, and content is sponsored by an advertiser. BelVita is the launch sponsor, but Refinery29 declined to detail how sponsorships would work or be priced.Refinery29 This AM is a free download on iTunes.
