Hello dear friends, and welcome back to another episode of TCBTC, TechCrunchs kinda-weekly bitcoin podcast.This time around the Skype booth, main host John Biggs and myself dug into the Winklevoss twins love of bitcoin, consumer interest in the cryptocurrency itself, and something technical that we probably got around half right.We apologize for the minor hiatus. Its been a hectic, if quite fun few weeks here at TechCrunch and we are just now back in our proper countries and states.Do me a favor: Shoot over an email to alexkaiserwilhelm [at] gmail.com and tell me what sort of guests you want us to bring on the show, be that more startup founders, venture capitalists, technologists, or really anything else that is part of the bitcoin world.Until then, the audio and weekend are yours.Download MP3Subscribe on iTunes.You can subscribe to the show here.
