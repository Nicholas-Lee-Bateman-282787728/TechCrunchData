As a college student, most of my friends and family are spread out in tons of different cities across the country. While Id love to keep track ofmajor weather events in all of these cities, it is way too time-consuming toconstantly check iOS 9sweather app.Enter PocketWatch.The service lets you create notifications for cities around the world, then get text message alerts before hazardous or inclement weather hitsthose cities. Its an easy, freeway to keep tabs on friends and family who you might not talk to everyday, but would want to know if their region was at risk of a major weather event.PocketWatch was built today at theTechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015 Hackathon by a team of five brand-new programmers.The team is comprised ofDarien Lombardi,Samantha Degges,Ben Huang,Alice Wu andAustin Ezell, who are allfour weeks into Coding Houses 15-week code boot camp.PocketWatch was builtusingWeather Underground and Twilios APIs on top of JS, Angular, NodeJS and Firebase. The teamalso plans to incorporate other endpoints besides Weather Underground for redundancy, primarily Hurricane and storm watch APIs.
