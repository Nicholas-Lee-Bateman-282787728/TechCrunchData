A somewhat unlikely suspect might just have revealed the best-looking Android Wear-powered device: The Huawei Watch, from the gadget-maker of the same name, made its official debut onstage today at Mobile World Congress, and its easily one of the best looking devices ever to sport Googles wearable software platform.The Huawei watch has a 286 PPI 1.4-inch AMOLED display, with a 42mm round face that is actually on the smaller side compared to most of the gargantuan Android Wear devices out there. Itll come in gold, silver and black finishes for its stainless steel body, and will also offer a built-in heart rate monitor, 4GB of onboard storage, 512MB of RAM, the standard loadout of motion sensors for activity and health tracking, and Bluetooth LE for device pairing.Huaweis wearable looks to combine the best aspects of the Android Wear crowds reigning champs, offering a perfectly circular display, with a bezel size that wont necessarily invalidate those with smaller wrists from wearing one. The company plans to launch the device in 20 countries worldwide, and it should go on sale in June of this year, though the company isnt talking price yet.The decided factor in the Android Wear category continues to be design, and this looks frankly a lot nicer than either existing options or other new ones, including the forthcoming LG Watch Urbane.
