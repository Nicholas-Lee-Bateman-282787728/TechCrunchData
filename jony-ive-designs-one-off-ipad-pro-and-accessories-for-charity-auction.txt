Want some serious bragging rights in the tech community? Why? Inquire within yourself whether this craving for attention is healthy, and if you still want those rights, consider bidding on this one-of-a-kind iPad Pro and accessories designed by Jony Ive. Its for a good cause, or at least you can tell yourself that.Its all part of a fundraiser for Londons Design Museum, which is moving this year to Kensington from its historic digs on the Thames just east of the Tower Bridge.Edition 1 of 1 is laser etched on the back of the iPad, in case people dont believe you. Of course, anyone can have that etched on their device, though theirs certainly wont be as yellow as yours.The iPad will be up on the block come April 28, and the auctioneers expect bids to reach 10-15,000 (about $15-20,000).If youd prefer a fine vintage bike or a charming mid-century daybed, check out the online auction, currently underway.
