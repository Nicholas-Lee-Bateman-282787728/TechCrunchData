Beacon marketing company inMarketis unveiling a new technology that it calls Quantum Receptivity, which it says can helpmarketersfigure out when they should show an ad to a shopper and have the biggest impact.Its really about cherry picking marketing times  not just things like days of week, but based on each individuals unique commercialfingerprint, said CEOTodd Dipaola.When Dipaola is talking about a consumers commercial fingerprint, hes referring to the location data that inMarket already has access to. That allows the company to see when someone visits a store, how often they comeand when theyre due to for their next visit. So if you go to the supermarket every Friday, then it mightmake sense to target ads at you on Thursday, or right before you leave.The company says it has location data about tens of millions of shoppers in categories like groceries, entertainment and auto. Quantum Receptivityalso allows inMarket to expand its platform, so that its not just helping marketers deliver their messages in their stores, through beacons, but also using that data to target more traditionaldisplay advertising.In beta testing, Quantum Receptivity led to an 8 percent increase in store visits (compared to users who werent targeted in this fashion) and a 14 percent increase in dollars spent per trip.
