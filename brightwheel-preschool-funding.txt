Brightwheel,a mobile communicationplatformfor early education, is launching today with $2.2 million in seed funding to provideboth teachersand parents of young children with peace of mind.Theoversubscribed seed round wasled byRRE Ventures and Eniac Ventures, with participation from CrossLink Capital, Golden Venture Partners, Red Swan Ventures and Sherpa Ventures.Brightwheel has builta mobileappthatteachers can use for daily record keeping, communication with parents, and payment collection. Ideally, teachers can spend less time recording details, while parents receive regular updates about their children.By law, preschool teachers are required to log attendance, activity, and bodily fluids for students under the age of five  a process thats currently conducted, for the most part, with pen and paper.Youll have three different teachers looking for the right piece of paper to write all of these things down, and that paper goes home with the parent who looks at it once and recycles it, says Dave Vasen, founder of Brightwheel.On top of that, preschool education is entirely private, which means many teachers have to deal with running a business after students leave at the end of the day.Anytime you find a business that still uses paper, email and Excel to run their core processes, theres generally a pretty big opportunity, says Steve Schlafman of RRE, who led the round for Brightwheel.Pre-Kindergarten education is a $45 billion dollar market in the U.S. alone, with over 12 million children enrolled.The classic case you hear from parents of children above age two is, you ask what your child did that day and you get nothing  you get I played with Billy, says Vasen.The momentswhere parents can get involved in their childs education  like at the dinner table, or in the car ride home  are lost because the parents dont know whats going on during the day, he says.By improving communication between parents and teachers, Brightwheel aims to solve this problem. Theyve already started rolling out the platformin a small group or schools (a hundred or so) across 30 states.Vasen says his goal is to be in every preschool, daycare, and after-school program in the U.S., serving as the point of connectivity between teachers, parents, and students. The appis currently free, but in the future, schools will have the option to pay a monthly fee for additional features and services.
