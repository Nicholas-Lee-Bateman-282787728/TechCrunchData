Affirm, the alternative lending site startedby PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, has raised a $100M Series D led by fellow PayPal co-founder Peter Thiels Founders Fund.The all equity round, which was confirmed to TechCrunch by the company, also included participation from existing investors including LightspeedVenture Partners, Spark Capital, Khosla Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and Jefferies.Fundraising For ExpansionWhile some of Affirms loans are packaged and sold to third-party banks, the company also carries some directly on their balance sheet. So, one reason forthe large funding round was to prepare the balance sheet for a delugeof new loans that the company expects to issue over the next 6-12 months.See, while most people use Affirm a few times a year to buy big-ticket items like a Boosted Board or Casper Mattress, the company is striving to reacha future where a users regularpurchases are backed by Affirm loans. Think clothes from J. Crew or Lululemon, or supplies from The Home Depot.Andsince the vast majority of these more regular retail purchasesstill happen in brick and mortar stores, Affirmis going to have to expand its current selection of merchants, and maybe evenpartner withsome big-box stores like Target or Walmart.A new partnership like this would presumably deluge the startup with customers, hence the large fundraising now in anticipation of a potential rapid growth in loan issuancessometime in the near future.Affirm vs. A Credit CardThe obvious question in regard to Affirms short-term goal ofoffering usersmore loans for smaller amounts is should customers really bebuying inessentials like Lululemon on borrowed money?But Levchin has a different perspective. He explained that Affirms product (which is essentially a fixed-rate loan) is very different from a credit cards revolving line of credit.For example,Affirm loans have no late fees, no compound interest, and no balance to be carried. This is a stark contrast to a credit card which will exponentially compound your interest for each month you carry a balance.Essentially, Affirm helpscustomers afford aLululemon jacket by spreading outequal payments over three months, instead of putting it on a credit card where interest would compound eachmonth.The Future of AffirmBut Levchin knows that even if he is able to vastly increase the amount of loans issued by Affirm,the companys growth will still be limited by the sheer fact that it doesnt make sense to offer or accept a loan for products below a certain price point. And even if Affirm issues a dozen loans a year to each user, the platform is only being used about once a month by the consumer.So, the startup will use some of this new funding to develop a host of services outside of traditional financing, alldesignedto grow and increase user engagement.While Affirm hasnt revealed what these products will look like, they made it clear that the newservices are designed be used by Affirm users on a daily basis. These new products could be things like money management help, budgeting tools, or even something to help with overall personal financing decisions.Also, Affirm will soonstart reporting both positively and negatively to the major credit bureaus, which could helpsuccessful Affirm repayments translate into better overallcredit for those that are young or just underserved by FICO credit scoring.To date, the company has raised $420M in a combination of debt and equity funding, according to CrunchBase.
