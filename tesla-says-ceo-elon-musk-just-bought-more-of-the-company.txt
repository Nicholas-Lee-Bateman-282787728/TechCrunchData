Tesla CEO Elon Musk thinks shares of his motor company are headed upward.Thats the apparent message reporters received this afternoon from Teslas PR machine, which sent out an alert that Musk exercised 532,000 of his options in the company, or about $100 million worth, earlier today.According to an SEC filing, the options were exercised at $6.63 a piece, which would have produced $98 million forMusk had he sold the shares. Theyre currently trading at $191 per share.Of course, Musk, who is widely celebratedfor his unwavering belief in his companies, didnt sell the shares. Instead, hes hanging on to them and, according to the company, he used more than $50 million in cash to both pay for the options and the taxes incurred from the transaction.Musk now owns roughly one-fifth of Tesla, which is expected to unveil itsmost affordable car to date, the Model 3, in March. Hesaid earlier this week that itsgoing to be probably the most profound car that we make.(By the way, Bloomberg ran a great feature earlier today about everything to knowabout the Model 3 so far.)
