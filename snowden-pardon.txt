It looks like whistleblower Edward Snowdenmight berenewing his lease at his Moscow apartment.Today, the White House responded to and dismisseda nearly two-year-old petitionasking for the pardon of Edward Snowden, and citedthathis decision tosteal and disclose classified information had severe consequences for the security of our country and the people who work day in and day out to protect it.The We the People petition was created just daysafter the first Snowden disclosures were made public regarding government surveillance programs like PRISM. Since its creation thepetitionhas garnered nearly 170,000 signatures. The White House has generally responded to petitions on the site that havecrossedthe 100,000 signature threshold.The letter, composed largely of a statement fromLisa Monaco, the presidents adviser on Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, not only dismissed the notion of a pardon, but also seemed to argue that Snowden should return to America to accept the consequences of his actions.If he felt his actions were consistent with civil disobedience, Monaco said, then he should do what those who have taken issue with their own government do: Challenge it, speak out, engage in a constructive act of protest, and  importantly  accept the consequences of his actions. He should come home to the United States, and be judged by a jury of his peers  not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime. Right now, hes running away from the consequences of his actions.Monaco went on to cite that these views fit into a narrative shared by President Obama. As the President said in announcing recent intelligence reforms, We have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves and sustain our leadership in the world, while upholding the civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals and our Constitution require.'Snowden is currently residing under asylum in Moscow where he facescharges from the United States under the Espionage Act, charges that he believeswould not lead to a fair trial if he were to return to the U.S.
