Fantastical, one of the more popular calendaring applications designed for Apple users on iOS and Mac, has this morning rolled outits long-anticipated upgrade to its Mac app with the release of Fantastical 2.The upgraded app has been designed exclusively for OS X Yosemite, and supports a number of Yosemite features, including a Today Widget, Action and Share extensions and Handoff support, for example.The app, which is also notablymore expensive than the earlier version, includes improvements to its natural language processing engine, as well as the introduction of new features, such ascalendar sets, which let users toggle on and off various groupings of calendars and reminder lists.For example, you could create a calendar set containing your personal calendars, like your family calendar, kids school calendar, personal to-dos, and family birthdays. Plus,you can configurethe new Fantastical app to automatically activate that calendar set when you arrive or leave a particular location, too. That way, you could have your personal calendar set pop up when you arrive at home, while having your work calendar set appear when you take your Mac to the office.Fantastical 2s update also includes improvements to its natural language processing engine, which understands calendar appointments written in everyday speech. This has for a long time been one of the apps main selling points, as it allows users to create appointments more quickly by just typing them in as sentences or phrases, instead of having to click through a bunch of fields. Nowthe app isable to process more complex input like every third Thursday of every month, for instance, or every weekend, the last weekday of the month, and more, the companynotes.iCloud Reminders are better, too. You can create these by writing things like reminder, to do, task or even remind me to, and then add dates, times, and even location-based geofences if you choose, in order to be alerted when you arrive or leave a location. Events and reminders can also now be seen together in the main list.Like the earlier version, the new calendar supports iCloud, Yahoo and Google Calendars by way of its new CalDAV engine, allowing you to manage calendars across a variety of services. You can still pull the calendar down from your Macs menu bar, butthe upgraded app includes a full calendar view, too, similar to the iPad version. Here, you can viewyourday, your month oryour year, as you choose.Theres also a new light theme available, as well as full localization forEnglish, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese.Flexibits, the developer behind the Fantastical suite, first released the calendar for Mac four years ago, which then led to its expansion to iOS devices where the app is regularly well-ranked and often featured by Apples editorial team.With the release ofFantastical 2, the company is going after its most devout customer base with a launch price of $39.99, to later be followed by a standard price of $49.99. That may seem like a lot for a calendaring app, but its one thats aimed squarely at Fantasticals heaviest users  those for whom the app is a must, not a nice to have.But the pricing is also sure to ruffle some feathers, since there will be those who want the new app but cant afford to make the leap.The app offers a 14-day free trial if youre on the fence. Otherwise, its available to purchase from either the Mac App Store or the Flexibits website.
