The 360fly camera, a small, sturdy ball with panoramic views we first discovered at CES 2014, is back again and buddying up with sports brand BRG to bring us live or recorded, 360-degree, stitchless,4k video for sports enthusiasts and with all that, a plan to push into virtual reality.GoPro has its own spherical solution, with 4k recording capabilities for those live-action shots and Kodaks PixPro aims to do the same.GoPros device sticks up on helmets and has the potential to catch on twigs and leaves during the shot. However, Giro and Bell  both BRG brands  will embed these all seeing 360fly camerasinto their sports helmets to capture live or playback 360-degree video for use with Google Cardboard or an interactive app on an iPad or smartphone.Imagine getting panoramic video from a snowboarder rolling down the alpine wilderness, taking a leap off a high ledge and into the fresh snow below, and bringing that continuous, all-angles view to the world, live in interactive video or virtual reality.360fly also gave the TechCrunch crew a sneak peek at a 360-degree-capable drone with top and bottom single lens cameras affixed for video from every angle  something the company has been hush on so far. Interestingly, GoPro recently introduced Karma, a drone rumored to be 360-degree capable and VR ready, too.GoPros stock plummeted late last year with the introduction of better smartphone cameras. Some have speculated that a 360-degree drone could be the ticket to getting it back in the game  though 360flys drone might just beat it there.360flys head of content Andy Peacock didnt want to say too much about the drone but did speak with TechCrunch about the new BRG partnership and camera capabilities. He also showed off an upgrade to the app that lets you adjust camera brightness and other features for better viewing.The new advanced 360fly camera features include:The cameras 360-degree surveillance ability also includes:Each camera will retail for $499, up from the original $400 sold at Best Buy.
