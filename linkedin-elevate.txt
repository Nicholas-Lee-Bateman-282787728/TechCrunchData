LinkedIn, the social platformwith350 million users where peoplenetwork forbusiness deals, new jobs, news, andsoontolearn a thing or two,is nowtapping another business area: social media management.Today, the company is taking the wraps offElevate, a paid mobile and desktopapp that suggests articles to its users  based on algorithmsfrom its news recommendation services Pulse and Newsle, as well as human curation  and thenlets users schedule and share those links acrossLinkedIn and Twitter, with the aim to add more networks like Facebook over time.Elevateis opening up for a closed, paid pilotstarting today. LikeFacebook atWork, anyone will be able to download the iOS or Android apps. But only those who are signed up for Elevate(and paying for it) will be able to use it.The plan is to haveElevate in general availability by Q3 of this year, at which point LinkedIn will also unveilpricing. In Q1, LinkedIn says it ran a private pilot with several large companies, including Unilever, Adobe and Quintiles, which is helping it figure out how the app is getting used, and what form that pricing might take.You can think of Elevateasa very pared-down, LinkedIn-focusedHootsuite, which lets users schedule and share social media content acrossmultiple networks.Or, perhaps more directly, LinkedIns version of the Daily app from Buffer, which uses the Bufferscontent suggestion technologyand then lets you schedule and share those links.Or you can think of it as LinkedIns latest move to compete against the likes of Salesforce perhaps some combination of all three.(The Buffer similarity is interesting, incidentally, given that one source close to LinkedIn told me a while back that he had suggested to higher-ups at the company that it should try to buy the startup.)Just as Hootsuite and Buffer are designed for both social media professionals andmore casual social media junkies, the idea behind Elevate is the same.For marketing professionals, it helps them keep the social media wheels turning,with story suggestions letting them stayactive even when they have no links of their own to share, and analytics to track how well things are performing. They will be able to create specific topic areas to track, for example related to specific company objectives (e.g, a campaign aimed at hiring more female engineers).But whats interesting is that Elevateseems to be aimed also at having a wider appeal to a companys largerpool of employees, effectively co-opting them in the larger social media marketing effort. For them, one carrot is that they can use Elevate to track how sharing content leads to more profile views and other stats  or, as product manager Will Sun puts it, Elevate helps general employees to besocial professionals.Rousing up more employees in a company networkis actually a largely untapped area forLinkedIn. It says that today only about 2% of a companys employees share their companys news on LinkedIn, butcollectively those employees will have ten times as many connections on LinkedIn as their company-employer does.To sweeten the deal for those considering Elevate, LinkedIn has shared some of the early results of how Elevatesclosed pilot performed. Unsurprisingly, the numbersare positive. LinkedIn says that for each sixpieces of content that are shared by an individual, on average, that individualreceives six profile views and makes two new connections.AndLinkedIn says that when an employee shares content, on average its employerresults in six job views, three Company Page views, and one Company Page follower, which helps them better hire, market, and sell, writes Sun.Of course, Elevate holds a lot of potential benefits for LinkedIn, too.As the company continues to look for more revenue growth, LinkedIn has been diving into a lot of new areas in the last couple of years, specifically to build out its content business.That has included acquiring news recommendation services Newsleand Pulse;growing its publishing platform  which now sees 50,000 pieces of content each week and also adding whole new business areas, likee-learning site Lynda.com, acquired last weekfor $1.5 billion.Although Elevate sits in LinkedIns business solutions division, its also a content play of another kind: it provides more data points and potential traffic for LinkedIn content, which in turn will help boost traffic and engagement on the network.But there is still a long way for LinkedIn to go when it comes to engagement on its site  recall the 2% stat that it shared for employees sharing company news. Elevate could go some way to improving that ratio.On the other hand, building a paid B2B social media management service also gives LinkedIn another potential revenue stream to grow itsbusiness solutions, providing a strongercomplement to revenues that LinkedIn makes from recruitment services (Talent Solutions) and its growingadvertising business (Market Solutions). In total, LinkedIns current revenue-generating services collectively brought in $643 million in revenues last quarter.Indeed, as LinkedIn matures, what may be most important about Elevate is not that LinkedIn may make a killing from this one product, but that its raising its B2B apps game.
