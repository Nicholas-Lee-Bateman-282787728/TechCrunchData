Ameyo, a Gurgaon-based startup that makes software for customer support and sales centers, has raised a Series A of $5 million from Forum Synergies.The company, which already has customers throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, plans to use the capital to expand into the United States.Ameyo claims its software has already beeninstalled by 1,600 customers in 40 countries, including Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart, Ola Cabs, and Chase Bankin Kenya, and manages more than one billion customer interactions every day.The platform, which integrates with most major CRMs like SugarCRM, Salesforce, and Zendesk, bills itself as a cloud-based all-in-one software-based communication solution that makes it easy for support centers to manage each interaction with a customer and increase the speed of sales.We believe CRMs do a good job of being the system of record, but fail to provide automation and interfaces to handle interactions and give an overall picture of engagement, co-founder Sachin Bhatia tells TechCrunch.While Ameyo competes with a host of other contact center infrastructure products like Genesys, Five9, and Incontact, as well as sales acceleration software InsideSales.com, RingDNA, and Velocify, Bhatia says its key differentiation is flexibility. Many other products rely on hardware or IT departments, but Ameyo lets all departmentsincluding collections, helpdesks, and salesuse the same platform and see the same data from integrated CRMs and business apps.Ameyos parent company is Drishti, which was founded in 2003 by Bhatia, Bishal Kumar, and Nayan Jain, and now numbers 300 employees. While Ameyo is targeted to large enterprises, Drishti also makes another platform, TexoCC, targeted at sales and support centers run by mid-sized companies. Its current clients include Subway, UrbanClap, Grofers, and PepperTap.
