Dear friends, readers, and general Internet-goers!The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off is drawing near, and it would truly break my heart if you missed out on our big night, either as a general attendee or a participant in the world-renowned TC Pitch-Off.What does that mean? Good question!The TechCrunch Meetup is an event that gives 10of the brightest and most exciting startups from NYC the chance to pitch their startup (in 60seconds or fewer) to a panel of incredible VC/founder judges.After each pitch, the judges (yet to be announced) will hold a quick Q&A and eventually choose a set of winners.First place gets a table in the Startup Alley and two tickets to TechCrunch Disrupt SF in September. Second place gets two tickets to the big show, and the Audience Choice winner gets one ticket to the conference.But lets say youre not an entrepreneurThere is still fun to be had on the evening of August 18 in the great city of New York. There will be networking, a sure-to-be entertaining pitch-off, and plenty of booze (21+ only, please).Tickets are $25, and can be purchased here.If you want to apply to participate in the Pitch-Off, hit up this link.We hope to see you very soon.
