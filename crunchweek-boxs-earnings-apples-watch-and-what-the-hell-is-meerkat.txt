CrunchWeek is back with a new face running the ship: Recent TechCrunch hire Sarah Lane was our captain this time around, joined by myself and Kyle Russell. We kicked over the most important stories of the week, including the announcement of pricing dataand release dates for Apples Watch, Boxs earnings which caused the companys stock to move dramatically, and Meerkat, which Im told is actually a small varmint.Last week CrunchWeek shot its last episode in its now-former set. Since then weve knocked down a large wall in our studio, meaning this weeks Crunchweek was recordedon something approaching an anti-set. Pardon our dust as we build.Well see you all back here in a weeks time.
