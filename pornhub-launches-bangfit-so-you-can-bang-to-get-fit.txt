In seemingly bizarre news out of the porn industry, PornHub is launching a new fitness system (wearable + workout videos) called BangFit.As its name suggests, it helps you bang to get fit.Heres how it works:Users can join the game at this website, which will allow users to then sync the game to their phones. BangFit offers options for one player, two players, and three players.From there, you can choose your sexercise, with information about how each position burns calories (man vs. woman) over a thirty-minute period.Thats where the BangFit Band comes into play. Users can pop their phone into the BangFit Band (a belt worn by one player) to measure their success in getting fit while getting busy.For now, PornHub says the BangFit Band is going to be available soon, and that the software product is in beta.I tried to pair two phones with the web app and check it out, but the webapp failed to recognize one of the two phones as paired. I also cant seem to figure out if this thing supports gay and lesbian couples.That said, this is a fun marketing stunt for PornHub.The company has an early foothold in VR, and is wont to pull fun tech-related marketing stunts like an emoji porn texting service.Check out the video below:
