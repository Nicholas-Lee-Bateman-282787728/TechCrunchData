Safety regulations fordrone usage continue to be formulated, with the USFederal Aviation Administration last monthproposing afour-tiered classification systemwith different rules for how drones can and cant interact with crowds. The FAA also has a task force weighing in on the issue.But there are other considerations here too  not least how drones will impact personal privacy.Given drones are basically flying cameras theres no shortage of eye-in-the-sky concerns as usage of the tech proliferates.In February last year U.S. president Barak Obama asked the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which advises on telecoms policy issues, to bring variousstakeholders together to help developbest practices to address privacy, transparency and accountability issues relatingto private and commercial use of UAS (aka drones).Balancing such concerns with the commercial imperativeto leverage drones for services such asdelivery (as Amazon is keen to, for example) or nicheindustry use-cases, from farming to remote inspection, is going to be a key piece of policy work in the coming years.The NTIA has now published the fruit of its labors  setting out best practice privacy guidelines for using drones to gather personally identifiable data. The guidance was drafted by the various stakeholders involved in the process, which included drone companies, consumer privacy groups and news organizations. Not all stakeholders agreed with the guidelines but the NTIA says a consensus was reached.But dont get too excited; the recommendations arevoluntary, so there are no teeth to be found here.Add to that, not only are the suggestionsnot legally enforceable they arent exactly reassuringly robust  with plentiful use of qualifiers like where/aspracticable, reasonable effort/expectation, and so on.Still, its a first pass at trying to set some expectations about what might and might not be considered overly creepy behavior from drone operators. (NB: The guidance does not apply to newsgathering and news reporting organizations owing to their strong constitutional protections, with the NTIA noting they may use UAS in the same manner as any other comparable technology to capture, store, retain and use data or images in public spaces.)Voluntary best practice for drone operatorsAmong the recommendations suggested, drone operators are urged (with some caveats) to provide prior notice to individuals of the general timeframe and area that they may anticipate a UAS intentionally collecting covered data  where covered data means data that can identify a particular person.When they are anticipating that drone use mightresult in collecting covered data they should also provide a privacy policy that is appropriate to the size and complexity of the operator, or incorporate such a policy into an existing privacy policy, and have it inplace and publicly available no later than the time of collection.This policy is suggested to include:Other general suggestions in the guidelines include that drone operators should:On specific suggested usage limits for personally identifiable datagathered by drones, the guidance suggests the following areas should be off-limits (i.e. without express consent from the data subject):So your boss should not really bedeploying a drone over your house to check if you are sunbathing in your garden that timeyou called in sick. Although, legally speaking, it may still be possible.Sharing covered data gathered via drone is also addressed in the guidance. And when it comes tosharing drone-harvested data for marketing purposes this should only be with consent, the guidance suggests.However no limits are placed on the use/sharing of aggregated covered data as an input (e.g., statistical information) for broader marketing campaigns. So drones being deployedas data gathering tools for market research appears to be considered fair game.Drone operators are also urged to properly secure any personally identifiabledatathey do collect, as youd hope they would.And the guidance also includes an appendix on neighborly use of drones  with suggestions includingdont harass people with your drone.The NTIA says the guidance representsan important step in building consumer trust, giving users the tools to innovate in this space in a manner that respects privacy, and providing accountability and transparency.These guidelines provide the flexibility to evolve as the industry grows while ensuring a baseline understanding of ethical practices, it adds. We will work with stakeholders on the best ways to disseminate and promote these practices broadly so that businesses and users that were not able to be at the table can take advantage of the collective wisdom in these documents while growing their UAS-related businesses or using their personal UAS responsibly. We look forward to continuing the conversation with stakeholders as this industry develops and grows.This story was updated to clarify that the guidelines arebased on a consensus opinion of stakeholders
