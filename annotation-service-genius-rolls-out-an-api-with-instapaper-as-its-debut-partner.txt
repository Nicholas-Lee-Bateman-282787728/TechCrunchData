Online annotation platform Genius, which originally began as a way to mark up rap lyrics before expanding to supportany page on the web,is now making its service  including its collection of annotations and musical metadata  available to third-party developers for use in their own applications. The first partner to take advantage of the new API is Betaworks, which integrated Genius with Instapapersnew Notes feature, launched yesterday.In Instapaper, the Notes feature allows users to select a snippet of text from an online article and then make comments next to that text. By default, thoseannotations are private, but users can choose to share them through Twitters textshot feature, or through other third-party applications, like Facebook, Evernote, Tumblr, and more.Geniuss API lets users post Instapaper Notes to Genius similar as to how they would post to Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere.The new API also supports the ability forusers to vote on annotations and earn Genius IQ, a sort of reputation system on Genius where points are awarded for various activities.However, because of Geniuss history as a service that initiallyfocused on music annotations, publishers of music-focused applications could also benefit from the new API, which is being made available for free, were told. Developers will be able to access the millions of crowdsourced annotations created to date on Genius.com, and will be able to search across Geniuss library of musical metadata, including artists, albums, and tracks.More details on the Genius APIare available here.Genius itself has something of a colorful history, engaging in childish antics on stage at events like TechCrunch Disrupt, and co-founderMahbod Moghadam made some inappropriate comments referencing tech leaders likeMark Zuckerberg and Warren Buffet in interviews. The company also got into trouble for tryingto cheat Google Search results by incentivizing bloggers to add links to the site to boost its SEO. Moghadam was later forced to resignafter makinga misogynistic comment on the Genius annotation of the Santa Barbara Massacre perpetrators manifesto.That being said, the site itself is one of the better resources for reading lyrics, as many of the competitors in the space are covered in spammy ads. And Genius often has a flare for translating corporate speak into laymans terms by annotating press releases  like the one where Verizons acquisition of (TechCrunch parent) AOL was recently explained, for example.Currently, Genius.com sees30 million monthly visitors, who create over 100,000 annotations. The companysays other API partners will be announced in the weeks ahead.
