Square filed for its initial public offering today,and buried in the companys boilerplate risk factors was a big one: CEO Jack Dorseys relationship with Twitter.Heres the relevant sectionon being able to depend on key management:Our future success is significantly dependent upon the continued service of our executives and other key employees. If we lose the services of any member of management or any key personnel, we may not be able to locate a suitable or qualified replacement, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train a replacement, which could severely disrupt our business and growth. Jack Dorsey, our co-founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Chief Executive Officer of Twitter. This may at times adversely affect his ability to devote time, attention, and effort to Square.Of course, Dorsey also co-founded Twitter.In the end, Twitter went with Dorsey, who will still be running both companies. It remains to be seen whether this will impede his ability to run Square, but the company is certainly acknowledging the possibility in its IPO filing.
