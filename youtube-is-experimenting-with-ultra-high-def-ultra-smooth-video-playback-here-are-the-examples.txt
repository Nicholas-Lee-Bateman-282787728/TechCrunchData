Just a few months back, YouTube bumped up the quality of the videos it hosts by allowing for gorgeous, 60 FPS video playback.Now theyre cranking things up to an almost absurd level. 60 FPS video, on YouTube at 4K.The catch? Its just something of an experiment, for now, and is limited to a reaaally tight batch of clips.Thats okay, though  the very vast majority of videos on YouTube arent shot at anywhere near this resolution/framerate yet, anyway. Cameras capable of shooting 4k/60FPS footage arent impossible to find, but theyre generally crazy expensive and are far from the standard.YouTubes selection of clips are all pretty gorgeous if your computer can handle them. Youll need a display capable of handling 38402160 to take advantage of the resolution to begin with  but if the rig behind the display isnt up to snuff, these videos will look way worse than they usually do. On a brand new Retina iMac, theyre mindbendingly beautiful. On my one-year old MacBook Air? Theyre a chunky, choppy mess.Here are some examples of 4K/60FPS on YouTube (make sure you tap that cog that shows up after you hit play and select the 4k/60FPS option. Expect buffering):If these videos dont run too hot on your system, dont feel too bad: most of the computers in our office choked on them, too.Aaaand thats why its a limited experiment, for now.If youre wondering how to get your own videos to play back on YouTube at 4k/60FPS, the simple answer is: you cant. Its only enabled on 6 hand-picked videos, for now.You can check out YouTubes full kinda-sorta-hidden 4k60FPS playlist here.So why are they tinkering with this now? Because they can, really  or, more accurately, because they can now. Some tweaks theyve made as of late to their codec and processing pipeline allows them to stream video like this within reasonable bandwidth constraints, whereas before it just wasnt feasible.
