Twitter is unveiling several new features for advertisers thatwant their campaigns to go beyond the social platform. And its giving the program a new name  the Twitter Audience Platform.Last year, the company launched something called the Twitter Publisher Network, giving advertisers one interface for buying campaigns that ran not just on Twitters websites and apps, but also withpublishers who were workingwith Twitter-acquired MoPub.Twitters senior director of revenue products Ameet Ranadive told me that the network now reaches 700 million people, and its getting a new name to better reflect the reasons that advertisers like it.Its really around audience  their goal is to reach a particular audience and leverage the unique data and signals that Twitter has, he said.Facebook has also placed an emphasis on targeting ads beyond Facebook through its revamped Atlas platform. Providingbroader reach for advertiserscould be a particularly important challenge for Twitter, given its difficulties with user growth.As for the new features, Twitter says advertisers no longer have to focus on drive mobile app installs or re-engagements  they can also set an objective to drive tweet engagements or video views. To support that, Twitter is also introducing new ad formats, with tweet engagement campaigns automatically transformed into interstitial and native ads in other apps, and Promoted Video campaigns becoming video ads. When you see these ads, youll have the ability to retweet or favorite them, directly in the ad unit.Twitter also commissioned a study from MediaScience showing that users spent 123 percent more time with Twitter Audience Platform ads than with normal mobile interstitials.You can read more on the Twitter Advertising blog.
