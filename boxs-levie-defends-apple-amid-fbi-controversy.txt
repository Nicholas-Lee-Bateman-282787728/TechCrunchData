Box CEO Aaron Levie spoke to TechCrunch about the ongoing saga between Apple and the FBI. Apples response to the government is something we completely wholeheartedly agree with, said the CEO of the cloud storage company. The world is going to get more complex, so you cant create weaknesses in software that then will become vulnerabilities in the future.If Apple were to comply with the FBI requests and create security loopholes in its phones, it would create a level of distrust in technology providers, Levie added. He thinks that the current situation could set a precedent for other countries. This has massive implications to how other governments will view technology privacy.Levie is not the first tech entrepreneur to weigh in on the topic. TechCrunch spoke to Mark Cuban, who applauded Apple for standing up to the FBI, yet called for a new law that would allow the FBI to hack the phones of deceased terrorists.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai also spoke out in defense of Apple.We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)! https://t.co/XrnGC9seZ4 Jack (@jack) February 18, 20161/5 Important post by @tim_cook.
