Facebook really wants you to use GIFs inside Messenger. The company recently unleashed a series of GIF apps from third-parties which work inside Messenger  as part of its Messenger platform initiative but it is now going beyond that with a series of pilots that bringGIFs right into Messenger without thoseapps.First off, Facebook is testing a dedicated GIF button which allows users to find and sendmoving images in two taps. Thats much easier than the current setup, which includes a fair amount of friction since users are required to download and use a dedicated app in addition to Messenger just to share content.The GIF button, which began appearing last week to some of Messengers 700 million monthly active users, is more practical. It skims a number of trending GIFs from Giphy and Riffsy  the two companies that produced dedicated apps for Messenger  and serves them up for easy sharing without the need to leave the Messenger app.The downside is, of course, that your selection of GIFs is more limited.Interestingly, once sent, the GIFs include a link to download either GIF for Messenger (Riffsy) or Giphy for Messenger, as you can see in the screenshot above.Is that promptan indicatorthat these GIF apps have receiveda lukewarm response from Messenger users?Thats one possible conclusion. Facebookdeclined to directly answer that question when we posed it to the social networking company.GIFs have seen success as a rich media format within Messenger, a company spokesperson told us. With this feature, were testing various ways to make it even easier to send great content  like GIFs  with just a few taps.So that could mean that Facebook makes other kinds of content more easy to share via Messenger? We shall see.The GIF button is an obvious way to juice up the use of GIFs  and potential downloads of those GIF apps  and the company is also testing anotherpilot with an integrated GIF search option.First spottedby Mashable, this experiment  which is apparently live with a selected number of users in Canada  allowsusers look up GIFs fromGiphy and Riffsy (those two again) and stickers within thespace where they type messages to friends.Type in your term, tap the magnifying glass icon and aselection comes up.Screenshot via MashableThese two integrations are tests at this point, which means theres no guarantee that either will roll out to all Messenger users. That said,theydo show that Facebook is keen to get you sharing more multimedia inside your chat sessions.The U.S. company isnt alone in making a push on GIFs, though. Tumblr launched a GIF search engine and a dedicated GIF sitein recent weeks, Twitter (kinda) introduced GIFs last year and made them autoplay this summer, whileHulu, Disney and the folks behind recently sold social app Pathare among the many others to havedabbled in GIFs in some form this year alone.Update: Facebook has officially rolled out the integrated GIF search feature to iOS users in the U.S. and Canada, as announced by Messenger boss David Marcus.Note: Article updated to correct the latest user number for Messenger
