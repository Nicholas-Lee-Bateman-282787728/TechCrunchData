Forty percent of all Americans will be arrested at least once,and even though around half will have the opportunity to expunge that arrest from their record, only one percent of them will actually go through the process.Easyexpunctions.com (which won last nights TC Radio Pitch-Off) aims to increase this number. The service usesapatented and automated process to easily expunge your criminal record for less than a third of the cost of a lawyer.After a user registers, the site will run a free background check to determine whether you have a criminal record that would qualify for expunction. If qualified, the user pays a flat $399 fee, which comes with a 100% money back guarantee if your record isnt expunged.Documents are automatically generated within 24 hours, and the service provides step by step instructions throughout the entire process.The end result is that your criminal record will either be totally expunged (meaning all government entities have to delete it from their databases), or deemed a non-disclosure (the government maintains a record of your crime, but legally cant tell anyone about it).In its first week of operation the company has signed up more than 5,000 people who are eligible to have their criminal record expunged. While currently only available in Texas, the service will soon expand to California, Florida, and New York.
