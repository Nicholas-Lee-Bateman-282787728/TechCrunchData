Atlassianhas long offered a number of Git-based developer services under the Bitbucket and Stash brands for developers who want either need a cloud-based or on-premises code management service. Now, however, the company is combining these brands under the Bitbucket name and launching a number of new features for its Git-based services.As Eric Wittman, Atlassians general manager of its developer tools division, told me, the company is currently seeing a lot of momentum around its Git product. Bitbucket customer growth in the companys last fiscal year was 80 percent, he said, and one in three Fortune 500 companies now use Bitbucket. Wittman stressed that he believes the companys momentum in the enterprise is at least partly due to Atlassians focus on professional developer teams. Our strength and focus has always been on helping teams collaborate, he said.Its worth noting, though, that Bitbucket now competes with the likes of GitHub Enterprise and other enterprise Git services. Even Microsoft, after all, now offers Git support in its Team Foundation Server products.With todays update, Atlassian isnt just combing the Stash and Bitbucket brands, but its also now making changes to how it develops these product. Wittman tells me that the two teams will now share more components across these product. Historically, the server team was always bigger and shipped innovations first. He also acknowledged that while the company put a lot of effort into getting Stash going two years ago, Bitbucket got somewhat lost in those efforts.Atlassian is also announcing three major new features to Bitbucket. The first is Git Mirroring, which will make it easier and faster for distributed teams to use Git. The second is support for large files  something Git has long struggled with  and the third is support for projects, which will make it much easier to organize complex Git repositories.
