Bonaverde co-founder Hans Stier took the stage this week at CES to give us an update on his company. As a reminder, Bonaverde raised nearly $700,000 on Kickstarter a few years ago for a coffee machine that roasts, grinds and brews coffee in fifteen minutes.Its hard to manage expectations when you have thousands of backers on Kickstarter. And Bonaverde is still working on it, producing and shipping its smart coffee machine to backers. But the company doesnt plan to stop there.As Stier told me on stage, Bonaverde is more than a hardware company. The team wants to reinvent the way you consume coffee by connecting you directly with farmers. The company greatly cuts the number of middlemen as you directly order green beans. Your machine will take care of the roasting and grinding.In the future, Bonaverde wants you to easily find a machine around you so that you can enjoy a cup of freshly produced coffee.Now it doesnt mean that Bonaverdes story has been a smooth ride so far. The company has had to deal with all the kind of issues you can get when producing a gadget, including having one of your employee leave with all the blueprints. But Bonaverde also wants to expand its coffee delivery platform.
