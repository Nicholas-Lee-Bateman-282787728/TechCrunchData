Genius is evenly distributed; opportunity is not. That truth is the driving principle behind Andela, a startup currently building a network of top tier computer science education programs across the African continent.The brainchild of Jeremy Johnson, co-founder of recently public edtech startup2U, Nigerian entrepreneur Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, American educationadvocate Christina Sass, and Canadian startup founder Ian Carnevale,Andela opened its doors in Lagos, Nigeria less than a year ago. Already, the companys track record and ambitious roadmap has attractedthe interest of venture investors in the U.S.Today, Andela isannouncing the closeof aSeries A round led by Spark Capital, the $2 billion fund headquartered in Boston that counts Twitter, Oculus, and Tumblr among its successful exits.Many of the companysseed investors, including impact fund Omidyar Network and Learn Capital, participated in the new round, which sources have confirmed to be well over $10 million.Answering The Call For Better Tech Education Andela put out its first call for applicants on Twitter in June of last year. At thatpoint, the startupdidnt even have a functioning website, but itquicklyreceived 700 applications for a four-spot program.I saw a tweet about this company called Andela that was saying well train you to be a world-class developer, and well pay you to do it, said Chibuzor Obiora, an Andela fellow who was teaching high school physics before he was acceptedinto the program last summer. It was really strange, it almost seemed too good to be true.Compared tothe Silicon Valley-obsessed culture in America, computer science isnt a very attractive fieldfor college students in Nigeria, Obiora said.When you tell someone youre a software developer in Nigeria right now, they think, Oh hes just playing with his computer, said Obiora. Careersin banking or energy are much more respected, he said, whereas many computer science majors are relegated to the much less trendy IT support industry after graduating college.This is largely due to the fact thatcomputer science programs in Nigeria dont prepare students for the startup world, according to Andelas founders.Every school in Nigeria has a computer science program, but they dont teach you anything practical, said Andela co-founder Iyinoluwa Aboyeji. Many of the graduates earn computer science degrees without ever writing a line of code.While this may sound absurd, co-founder Jeremy Johnson argues that even the best engineering programs in the world arent an adequate preparation for a career as a software engineer.The technology world has 18-month cycles and iterates rapidly, and unless youre really working and engaging with great teams, youre not going to be cutting-edge, Johnson said.Birds-eye view of the Andela cafeteriaSo while its shocking to think of what students in computer science programs in Nigeria dont learn, the reality is many computer science students in the U.S. dont learn how to do a pull request on GitHub, he said.Thats why Andela fellows are placed with a tech company just six months after they start their training, even though Andela pays students a wage that puts them in the top 5 percent of Nigerian income earnersfrom the start.During the four-year program, which is centered onacurriculum of both technical and business courses, each fellow is also a full-time employee at a tech company in the U.S., where they work in real-time with their U.S.-basedteam members.The idea is that after six months of intensive training, working as a developer is the best way to continue learning  and so far, its working. Andela has placed dozens of developers with companies ranging from Microsoft to Udacity, and Johnson saidthat 80 percent of clients have asked about bringing on more developers within the first six months.100,000 World-Class Developers In Ten YearsFor every software developer in the U.S., there are fiveopen jobs. Thats 1.8 million open IT jobs in North America alone, Johnson said.Nigeria has 178 million people with a median age of 17 and one of the highest internet penetration rates (and literacy rates) in Africa. It also has one of the highest youth underemployment rates - the unemployment alone is 50 percent, and Johnson said that underemployment raises that figure to 80 percent.After a year in operation, Andela has received more than 15,000 applications. Johnson said that the programs acceptance rate is .5 percent  ten times more selective than any U.S. university  withanaverage class size of abouttennew students per month.As you see 50 percent unemployment in countries like Nigeria, its clear there is a massive opportunity, because at the same time there are incredibly smart people there, said Alex Finkelstein, who led Andelas round for Spark.What Andela is really building is the MIT or Stanford Computer Science Graduate School. On the ground. In Africa, Finkelstein said.Thanks to a local co-founder, and relatively stable local politics, Nigeria was an ideal place for Andela to start.Theres a lot of optimism right now  maybe more than any time in the countrys relatively short history  that were moving toward increased stability, but theres also an acceptance that job creation is critically important, Aboyeji says.As the company continuesexpanding into new regions, with the first class slated to begin in Kenya next month, Johnson said that the mission is to train 100,000 developers across the African continent in the next ten years.Africa has seven of the ten fastest growing economies in the world, but one of the challenges is that access to human capital and technical talent, said Johnson.Our hope and expectation is that the Andela fellows, as they go through the program and graduate, play a key role in the continued growth of the continent overall.
