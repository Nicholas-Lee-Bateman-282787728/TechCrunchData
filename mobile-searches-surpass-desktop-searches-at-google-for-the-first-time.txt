Googles search chief Amit Singhal said for the first time this summer, more Google searches were completed on mobile devices than desktop computers.Singhal said Google fields more than 100 billion searches per month. The number is particularly significant because Singhal was speaking about just devices with screensthat are less than six inches, so it excludes many tablets.During theinterview with Kara Swisher at Code/Mobile on Thursday, Singhalspoke about the future of the companys search products.It does seem a little neanderthal-ish to put words in a box, Swisher said, challenging Singhal on the companys search function.Though Google commanded the market share of desktopsearch, Google increasingly competeswith Facebook and Apple for mobile web browsers. The company that dominated advertising on desktophas struggledto monetize mobile.Though the shift to mobile suggests Google is adapting to the new digital landscape, it poses more of a challenge for the company as mobile search isincreasingly vertical. Shoppers increasingly are bypassing Google and searching for products directly on Amazon.Singhalsaid when designing search for mobile, the company thinks about how you wantdifferent search options depending on your setting and your device. Hesaid you dont want to be talking to your phone when youre sitting in a quiet presentation, but when youre walking your dog you wouldnt want to have to type much.One way Google has tried to improve search on mobile is through Google Now, its personal assistant. But Google Now faces still competition from other artificially intelligent, voice recognition assistants, like Apples Siri and Microsofts Cortana.Singhals announcement comes one day after the company unveiled its Accelerated Mobile Pages Product.As its name suggests, theprojectaims to help webpages load more quickly. Many viewthe product as a competitor to Facebooks Instant Articles, though Google says it is not limited to news publications.
