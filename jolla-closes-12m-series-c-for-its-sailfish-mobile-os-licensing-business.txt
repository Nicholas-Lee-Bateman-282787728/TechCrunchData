Alternative mobile OS maker, Jolla, whose Sailfish licensing business aims to compete with Googles Android platform by offering OEMs the ability to tailor themobileplatform to their needs, has closed out a $12 million Series C financing round.Back in Novemberthe startup ran out of runway after failing to close itsSeries C in time, and was forced to let go of half its staff. It also had to begin a debt restructuring process.Jolla says it has now cancelled thatdebt restructuring process, andsaysthe $12 million Series C closingis enough to see it through to the end of the year.The startup received the first tranche of the round at the back end of last year, but was not disclosing how much funding it had taken in at that time. It has now closed out the round, at $12 million, which is a little higher than the $10 million it had originally sought last year.For some context on the size of the round, a new mobile OEM called Sirin Labsraised a $72 million seed round at the end of last month, aiming to build secure smartphones  a space Jolla has also previously said it intends to target with a security-hardened version of its OS(andrather more modest financial backing).The Series C financing will befully focused on Jollas SailfishOS licensing business. Itsaid today itis also looking torecruit more software developers to bolster its product development for new and upcoming products.A new community program is also in the pipeline  but Jollasaid details on this will be announced shortly.Last year the startupstepped away from the device-making side of its business, splitting into twoand saying it was focusing its initial efforts on the OS  with only a vague plan to establish another entityto continue to build devices.We are currently focusing strongly on software development, and licensing projects, meaning that consumer device business is not our ambition as such. However, we might of course introduce new interesting spearhead products for Sailfish OS, Jolla chairman Antti Saarnio told TechCrunch.Extending its licensing partnerships program is the clear priority now. As well as successfully seeinglicensee devices arrive in their respectivemarkets.Back in FebruaryJolla announced it had signed its second OEM partner, Africas Mi-Fone, following an agreement with Indias Intex last July. The latters first Sailfish powered device, the Aqua Fish, had beenslated to be launched in Indiaby this month  although Jolla says now it is in the final phases of the project with Intex, and the device is set to enter the Indian market during the coming months.Sailfish has also been chosen as the OS to powera forthcoming smartphone from Turing Robotics  another device targeting the security/pro-privacy space. The device makers had originally intended to use Android but switched to Sailfish, citingdatasecurity as the motivation.Sailfish OS is already running fast on the Turing phone, and we are now working together to get all the needed software in place, added Saarnio in a statement. We at Jolla believe that it is possible to produce niche target group smart devices in Finland, as Turing is now planning to do. Our aim is to support them in the best way we can.One hardware hangover for Jolla  a crowdfunded tablet that had to be canceled followingthe companys Series C financial difficulties  remains, but Jolla has previously said it will refund all customers who donot receivethe tablet.The latest on the tablet is that Jolla saysit hasshipped nearly all available tablets to buyers, and is proceeding to fulfill promised refunds.The refund process will take place in two parts, with Jolla saying today that it anticipates that all payments from the first round willbe processed during April and May 2016. The second round is slated tobe paidwithin a year of round one  depending on itsfinancial status. So, presumably, depending on whether its able to secure a Series D round or not.Jolla is in the planning phase for our further financing rounds,Saarnio added.
