Former HP CEO and current presidential candidate Carly Fiorina took the stage at Disrupt NY today to talk about her campaign, experience at HP and the role of technology in politics.In talking about her experienceinthe tech industry today, Fiorina noted that she shepherded HP through the last tech downturn. She doesnt, however, believe that todays boom is comparable to that of the 1990s.We are in a different time for a whole host of reasons. There were some artificial things pushing the last boom. It wasnt sustainable, she noted. But I do think were in a rather frothy time. Specifically, she noted that a lot of the money today is going into applications and not into manufacturing.Talking about current tech fads, Fiorina also noted that she believes that we are still trying to find the balance between whatwe can do and we should do.Im willing to bet that 85 to 95 percent of what people spend doing on their technology today is pretty superficial and useless. Instead of using our tech to vote for American Idol and The Voice, why arent we using it to more effectively engage with our politicians, she wondered.On a similar note, she also argued that paying governmentworkersaccording to theirperformance instead of seniority would keep them from watching porn all day.
