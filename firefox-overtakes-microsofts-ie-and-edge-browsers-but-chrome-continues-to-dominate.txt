Microsoft may have built a new web browser that is befitting of todays Internet, but thedecision to develop Edge and deprioritize Internet Explorer might be benefitting its rivals. Thats according to a new report today from StatCounter, one of the most notable Internet tracking firms, which claims Mozillas Firefox browser has overtaken Edge and Internet Explorer on marketshare for the first time.StatCounter, which takes its data from three million websites which received an estimated15 billion page views per month, said that, as of April, Firefox represented 15.6 percent of its desktop web traffic globally, fractionally ahead of Internet Explorer and Edges cumulative reach of 15.5 percent.Allthree are well behind Google Chrome, which has more than one billion users across all platformsand accounts for over 60 percent of StatCounters traffic, but its notable thatFirefoxhad trailed the Microsoft browsers in February and March, according to StatCounters data. Apples Safari and soon-to-be-China-owned Opera are among the also-rans make up the rest of the field.Looking back over the past year of StatCounter data  which it is important to again note is for desktop Internet traffic  April was the first time that Firefox had any kind of lead on Internet Explorer. Edge, which is only available for Windows 10, doesnt have the marketshare to overcome that gap.StatCounter is an interesting barometer for Internet trends  it was among thefirst to signal that Chrome had become the worlds most populardesktop browser  but its data represents a (large) snapshot of the total webnot a definitive one. Furthermore, StatCounter itself notes that Internet Explorer and Edge are both ahead of Firefox in the U.S. and UK, two of the worlds most notablePC markets.That could suggest that in countries where Windows 10 isnt selling particularly well, perhaps because there are many existing machines running old versions in the market or high levels of piracy, as is the case in China and many parts of Asia,Internet Explorer is seeing higher churn than usual as older versions of the browserhave been killed off.The report could be a sign of the future, or a rogue statistic  but, either way, its clear that Chromes dominance isnt about to bechallenged any time soon.StatCounter is less reliable for mobile traffic but, if you are wondering, Chrome is again top dog there, ahead of Chinas UC Browser, Safari, Opera and the stock Android browser. Also of note: Samsungs browser for its Galaxy devices hasbeen on a growth spurt this year, though its share of the market remains below 10 percent, according to StatCounter.
