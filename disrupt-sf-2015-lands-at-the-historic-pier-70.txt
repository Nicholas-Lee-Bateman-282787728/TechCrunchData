The gears are starting to turn for Disrupt SF 2015, and in a few months, TechCrunch editors and a host of the most influential people in tech will be gathering to talk about the future of startups and technology. The conference will run from September 21 through 23 at San Franciscos Pier 70.Pier 70, located in San Franciscos Dogpatch neighborhood, has historical significance. Itwas the home to companies like the Union Iron Works and Bethlehem Shipbuilding, both of which built elaborate ships dating back to the 1880s.Everything from ferry boats, schooners and steamboats were built at Pier 70, as well as warships that were active in wars fromthe Spanish-American War toVietnam.At its peak during World War II, the pier was home to as many as 18,500 employees who worked to build ships to support the war effort.Today, the rusted venue is being revamped as part of a reformation project  Proposition F  that California voters passed in November 2014. The $100 million renovation project will rehabilitate three massive buildings occupying 28 acres on the pier, and will bring around 2,000 housing units, 1.8 million square feet of commercial space, 400,000 square feet for retail and nine new parks.The buildings themselves look run down from the outside, with rusted metal facades eliciting images of a bygone era. But the inside, with its massive steel beams and open space, provides a pretty awesome venue for large events.Were thrilled that Pier 70 will play host to TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015, and we cant wait to show you what we have in store for the space.Tickets to Disrupt are now available to purchase at super early bird rates, and you can secure your spot by buying a ticket here.
