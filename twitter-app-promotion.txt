It was just over a year ago that Twitter started a broad rollout of its mobile app promotion ads. Its marking the occasion with a blog post discussing how the program is going and announcing some new features.App install ads have been a notable success for Facebook, and theyre turning into a broader battle between the big digital media companies.In Twitters case, app promotionads can either take users to an app download page or deep link to a specific page within the app. (On the latter front, Twitters helped by its acquisition of mobile ad retargeting startup TapCommerce, which now reaches 40 billion ad impressions daily.)Richard Alfonsi, the companys vice president of global online sales, suggested that Twitter is a particularly appropriate place for app installads, since the user mindset on Twitter is to discover something new, and since 80 percent of its monthly active users are on mobile.The company doesnt break out app promotion revenue when it shares its broader mobile ad numbers, and todays post is less focused on overall trends and more on praise from individual advertisers like Postmates, Lyft and Comedy Central. For example, Lyft says Twitter ads perform 3x more effectively than those on other social media sites and says Twitterhas become our go-to channel for social media marketing.
