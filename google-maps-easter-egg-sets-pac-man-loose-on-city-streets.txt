Google has created a new Easter Egg for Google Maps (pretty much just in time for actual Easter) which lets you play Pac-Man in real-world locales on the companys Maps apps for desktop and mobie devices. Its easy to play, by either navigating to the Google Maps website or opening the app on your Android or iOS device, and then just searching for a location where Pac-Man might show up.Google is offering hints to help you find the iconic 1980s video game protagonist, but if youre in a hurry just search for times square and you should see a pixelated map flag icon like the one pictured here. Click on that and youll launch into a game with simple controls, letting you control Pac-Man as he evades his ghostly enemies with either the arrow keys on a computer or by swiping up, down, left and right to change direction on mobile.Rack up a decent high score with your five lives and then share it with others to see how well you can Pac in the streets.
