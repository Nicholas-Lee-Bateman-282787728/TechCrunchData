The Rift is here! The Rift is here!After years of build up and pre-release developer kits, the first deliveries of the consumer version of the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset started arriving this morning.Lucas and I got to spend time with the Rift over the past few days (read Lucas full review here)  and, though we rarely do unboxings these days and a gnarly cold was making my nose so stuffed up that I could hardly speak, we figured this one was worthy. Its a damned fine box with a whole lot of goodies crammed inside.Join us as we take our first steps into this crazy new future were in, wont you?(P.S  we figured out what that mystery tool at the end of the video is for: removing the headphones.)
