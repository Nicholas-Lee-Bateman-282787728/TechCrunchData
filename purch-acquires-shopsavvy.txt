Purch just announced that it has acquired ShopSavvy, the mobile shoppingstartup backed by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin.Purch was formerly known as TechMediaNetwork and operates sites including Toms Guide and AnandTech. The company recentlyraised a $135 million funding round, and has been actively buying up companies  this is its fourth acquisition in the past year.CEO Greg Mason said the theme across Purchs properties is helping people find the product they need, and then driving an actual purchase. The ShopSavvy app seems like a good fit for that vision.Across our currentportfolio, theres not a lot that we do in terms of price or deals or special offers, hesaid. Its more about, Whats the best product for my particular needs? and not necessarily about, Where do I get the most value or best price?  ShopSavvy has a lot of the raw material that we need to create a well-informed user experience.The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Mason said the ShopSavvy team will be joining Purch, and itsoffices will become the San Francisco branchfor New York City-headquartered Purch.
