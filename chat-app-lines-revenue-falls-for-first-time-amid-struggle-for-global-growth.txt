Mobile messaging app Line saw its revenue decrease quarter-on-quarter for the first time as the Japanese company battles to grow its user base amid increased competition worldwide.The company, which saw its monthly active user count rise by 6million to 211 million, posted revenues of27.8 billion JPY ($224 million) for Q2 2015. That represents a 37 percent year-on-year increase, but a 1percent decrease on its previous quarter of business.Line, which is owned by Korean internet giant Naver, makes its moneythrough in-app purchaseswithin titles on its games platform, by selling stickers, and through a platform that allows brands to connect with it users. The four-year-old company posted stellar revenue growth last year  its Q3 2014 doubled year-on-year, for example  but its failure to expand successfully beyond parts of Asia (half of Lines users are located in its three strongest markets: Japan, Thailand and Taiwan) has groundthings to a halt.The company has turned in a range of new services aimed at helping it grow its network in new markets  a keyboard app for iOS is designed to get users in SMS-centric U.S. into its ecosystem, while a new lite app is aimed at emerging market Android owners.But messaging apps are not like social networks. You dont chat or send stickers to yourself, soonboarding new users requires them to bring their friends over, and remain there, too. No friends, means no network effect, which means little engagement and lowmonetization opportunities.To its credit, Line has seen this coming and it has expanded its focus from chat to becoming a mobile content portal of sorts. The company has outed a range of digital services  including a YouTube-like TV service, a paid music streaming app, and mobile payments  and expanded into online-to-offline services with a taxi-hailing service, grocery delivery pilot and more. But in each of these cases, the services have only been launched in markets where Line has a strong user base  the aforementioned Japan, Thailand and Taiwan  because they only stand a chance of success withusers who are highly engaged.That again comes back to the network effect, which Line has struggled to reproduce outside of its three core markets.Not just a message app: CEO Takeshi Idezawa says he wants LINE to be a one-stop shop for games, music  #Converge pic.twitter.com/9XknUQH1aV Geoffrey Fowler (@geoffreyfowler) July 30, 2015The companysrevenue growth was always likely to slow given the increasing maturity of messaging apps worldwide, but, with itbelieved to be considering a public listing this year  itaborted a planneddual U.S.-Japan IPO in 2014  it needs to showprospective investors that its business has the legs to continue to develop, both in terms of users and revenue.Its hard to see Line making serious inroads in other markets worldwide because mobile messaging is no longer new, and every country already has its favorite app. Maybe its time for the firm to hunker down on its three key countries and capitalize on its popularity to really own the mobile experience and push its digital and online-to-offline services.In other news from Line today, the company launched a packaged Chrome app. It already has apps for Windows and Mac, but this new addition includes a note-taking feature.
