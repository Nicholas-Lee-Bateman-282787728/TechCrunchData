Agrilyst, the winner of our Disrupt SF 2015 Battlefield competition, today announcedit has raised a $1 million seed round for its indoor agriculture analytics service.The round was led by Brooklyn Bridge Ventures with participation from Metamorphic Ventures and a number of angel investors and seed funds, including the co-founders of QuickFire, another Battlefieldcompany that was later acquired by Facebook.As Agrilyst co-founder Allison Kopf told me, the funding round was oversubscribed. She attributed the interest from investors to thefact that the company combines agriculture  something investors are interested in but typically know little about  with the more traditional concept of a Software-as-a-Service business and data analytics.Thecompany, which is now about a year old, currently has six employees. When it launched at Disrupt SF, the company had only finished building a basic beta version of its product.Now, six months later, the company is launchinga new version of its service that is specifically optimized for vegetable producers.The servicenow alsoincludes workflow management tools, as well as support for tracking inventory and managing nutrients and pests. The new version also features an easier onboarding process.Just like in the beta, Agrilyst uses allthis data to then provide recommendations to indoor farmers for how they should manage their crops.The company also wants to add another dimension to this over time: flavor. To do this, itll have to start capturing data about taste first, though.Kopf noted that most indoor farmers still dont use sensors  and when they do, the data often goes to a local desktop and isnt stored online (so Agrilyst allows growers to import spreadsheets, too).Thats slowly changing, though, and Agrilyst can import data from the most popular sensor system in indoor agriculture (think CO2 and humidity levels). A lot of the data, however, still has to be entered by hand. Agrilyst isnt interested in becoming a hardware company itself, though, but instead plans to support as many third-party sensors as possible.When Agrilyst first launched, Kopf told methe company didnt want to be perceived as a cannabis company. That crop, after all, is typically grown indoors and represents a fast-growing market. Come July, though, Agrilyst will offer support for cannabis growers, too.
