Earlier this week I got on a call with Duane Jackson, founder of online accounting company KashFlow, which in late 2013 was acquired by Iris Software, making Jackson amillionaire many times over.His story is both unusual and inspiring; he tells it with refreshing candour in his recently released memoirFour Thousands Days, My Journey From Prison To Business Success.During the interview we discuss Jacksons conviction for drug trafficking,the transition from prison life to startup life, why he shunned VC money, and KashFlows eventual and successful exitnearly 4,000 days after Jackson left prison.You can listen to the full interview below.
