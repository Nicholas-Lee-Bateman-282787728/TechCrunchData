Brian Milne is a freelance writer and former senior reporter/editor for McClatchy Newspapers, advocating sustainable water technologies and precision agriculture. Will Gerry might look the part of a fourth-generation farmer  dirty denim jeans,shirt sleeves rolled up and a gray beard that wraps from brim to brim on his leather hat.But once Gerry whips the smartphone out of his pocket, he starts rattling offtechjargon and analyzing data points across his farm like a 20-something whiz kid from Silicon Valley.The Gerry family has been farming in Ventura County formorethan 140 years, but the longtime local grower isnt afraid to step away from conventional practices when it comes to growing berries in drought-parched California.In fact, Gerry has been growing blueberries withprecisionirrigation practices for more than a decade atCoastal CaliforniaBlueberry Farmin Camarillo, making the bold move to level the familys citrus and avocado trees in favor of 300,000 bushes that produce berries throughout the year for a global market.Weve always wanted to have this place healthy, Gerry said. Soil health is the beginning of all things above ground. If you dont have that soil health, youre not going to be able to compete over a long period of time. If its not sustainable, were out of business.Gerry started using sustainable technologies long before the current drought shined a bright spotlight on agriculturalwateruse.And withCaliforniafarmersexpected to lose about33 percent of their surface water supply this year, not to mention fallowing 6-7 percent of the states annual irrigated cropland, more and moregrowers are having to adoptprecision irrigation practices togrowmorecrop per drop.This is a permanent plant, Gerry said of his 170 acres of blueberries. Its not going to be dug up tomorrow and switched out, so we need this plant to stay healthy.Gerry points out that blueberries are extremely sensitive to dry or overly wet conditions, so he monitors plant stress and soil moisture levels in real-time usingHortaus smart irrigation management systemsin the field. The wireless, solar-powered stationsare equipped with soil and temperature sensors that report to the web in real time how his crop is faring.Using a smart phone, tablet or computer, Gerry is able to make irrigation decisions based on the live soil tension/moisture/temperature data. Using an online dashboard that graphs out plant stress thresholds, he knows exactly when he needs to turn on his computer-automated drip irrigation system, and,moreimportantly, when to turn it off once an optimal amount ofwaterand nutrients have reached the root zone.SinceMonsantos acquisition of Climate Corp. in 2013, the precision irrigation/agtechspace has been ahot one for investors.Throw inCalifornias historic drought, and theagtechspace is hotter than ever, with events such asGAI AgTech Week,Forbes Reinventing America: TheAgTech Summit, Ag Innovation Showcaseand theAgri-Investor Forumeating up investor calendars this year.Hortau, like a number of otherprecisionirrigation companies of late, has caught the eye of investors, and earlier this monthreceived $5 million in financingfromAdvantage Capital Agribusiness Partners.Otherprecisionandagtechcompanies to strike deals in recent months includeFarmersBusiness Network($15 million with Google Ventures),VitalFields($1.2 million from various backers, including SmartCap) andPowWow ($3 million in grants and angel investors).Speaking of Google andprecisionag,Eric Schmidts Innovation Endeavorsalso joined the investors backingthe ag-optimizing robot companyBlue River Technologylast year ($10 million, led by Data Collective Venture Capital), showing just how much traction the space is getting in Silicon Valley alone.But whichprecisionag companies will sustain? That comes back to adoption, and what solutions the boots on the ground are willing to adopt to help cut costs, as well as reduce water and energy use and environmental impact.Thatprecisionagapproach to delivering precisely how muchwaterand nutrients a plant needs in the root zone is being used by growers of both permanent and seasonal crops on the Central Coast of California.Local strawberry growers, for example, now make it a habit to improve soil health through precisionirrigation practices such as electromagnetic soil mapping and laser leveling of fields to help getmoreout of thewater resources they do have.Otherprecisionagpractices in use on Central Coast farms include:By usingprecisionirrigation management tools, local growers are able to be more proactive in the field and not only reducewaterconsumption but improve crop health and production, said Gil Luera, an irrigation management specialist for Hortau irrigation management systems. Its a critical part of the industry right now, finding innovative ways togrowmorewithless, and a lot of our local growers should be commended for the precisionirrigation practices theyve adopted.Like many operations inCalifornia, El Rio Farms in Oxnard is having to figure out innovative ways togrow morewithlesswaterduring the drought.The Oxnard region, known for growing many of the strawberries we buy in stores, is not only battlingwater shortages, but also salinity issues stemming from depletedwatersources, saltwater intrusion, urban and agricultural use, and treatedwaterdischarged into waterways.Despite the host ofwaterissues, El Rio Farms operations manager Pal Halstead said their strawberry operation was able to cutwateruse by about 27percent last season, thanks toprecisionirrigation practices such as drip irrigation and smart soil tension monitoring sensors.Im very passionate about water conservation, Halstead said. Its important to me,morethan just on a natural level. We really dont have a choice right now.Faced with a dwindlingwatersupply and a fourth consecutive year of drought,Governor Brown in Aprilimposed an executive order to help better manage irrigation for agricultural purposes along with improve in-fieldwater technologies.Local agencies are now tasked with imposing various degrees of cutbacks, and sustainable water management will soon become the new norm forCalifornia.Heading into the warmer summer months, the drought has already led toeconomic losses of an estimated $2.7 billion not to mentionthe loss of about 18,600 jobs  according toresults published in Preliminary Analysis: 2015 Drought Economic Impact Study by the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences.All of which means there aremorechallenges, conservation requirements and precision irrigation innovations on the horizon for our local growers.The impact that thewaterissue has on our lives is significant, Halstead said. Wateris hugely important, and conserving it is a legacy we have to hand down to the next generation.
