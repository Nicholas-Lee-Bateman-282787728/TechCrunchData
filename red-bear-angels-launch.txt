Hows this for school spirit? A group of alums have come together to invest in startups connected to Cornell.Chairman and founder Sam Sezak (also a partner at Blue Heron Capital) has a bachelors degree from Cornell. He said the idea began a few years ago, after he attended a Cornell entrepreneurship event  the event impressed Sezak with the communitys entrepreneurial energy, but he also said (via email) that it wasclear that Cornell needed to find a way to catalyze the alumni to efficiently provide both capital and expertise.Red Bear Angels (the group has no official connection to the university, and takes its name from Cornells unofficial mascot) has already made five investments since last year. Now the group is formally launching Red Bear Angels Management and has hired its first managing director, Meghan Cross. Cross was Cornell Class of 2008, and previously worked as director of communications at StyleCaster, before getting her MBA fromColumbia.The group aims to invest between $250,000 and $500,000 in seed, Series A and Series B deals forcompanies that are founded or led by Cornell alumni, faculty and students. The investors, on the other hand, dont have to be affiliated with Cornell  they just have to commit to making at least one investment per year. The group is also planning to raise a fund in 2016.According to Sezak, Red Bear isnt focused on a particular industry.Rather, we have a talent thesis, he said. We are capitalizing on the fact that Cornell University is home to the countrys best engineering program attached to the widest set of vocationally focused niches  from hospitality and agriculture to ergonomics and labor relations. And what better time to support this pool of talent than at the launch of the much-anticipated Cornell Tech & Technion campus?Red Bears portfolio includes development/investment firm CoVenture, agriculture financing startup ProducePay, ed tech company Academic Merit, the New York Code + Design Academy and Eversound, which makes hearing devices for the elderly.
