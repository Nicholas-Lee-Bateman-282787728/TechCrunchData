Get ready, Austin.For the fourth year running (maybe more, its hard to keep count) were visiting one of our favorite cities in the world to check out the shining stars of Austins stay-weird tech scene.Tomorrow evening at the Palm Door on Sixth, well be holding our world-renowned TechCrunch Pitch-Off, where some amazing companies will get exactly 60 seconds to pitch their product in front of a live audience and a panel of expert judges.But thats not all.After the presentations well hang out, talk about Austins up-and-coming startups, and have a few beers. (21+ only please.)But, we need you there. Thats the thing. So if you havent bought tickets, Id be highly appreciative if you made your way over to this link and commit.Its also worth noting that well be hitting up Seattle on June 25, so hopefully you folks on the West Coast are preparing yourselves.Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
