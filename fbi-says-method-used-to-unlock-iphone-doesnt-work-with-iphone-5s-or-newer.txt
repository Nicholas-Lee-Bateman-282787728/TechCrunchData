Slowly but surely, the FBI is releasing information about the method it used to unlock Farooks iPhone 5c involved in the San Bernardino shooting. Now that the Justice Department has dropped the case, the FBI doesnt have to disclose the mysterious method it used.First, the FBI disclosed this alternative method to some U.S. senators. And FBI director James Comey gave a few more hints. According to CNN, Comey said in a speech that the method doesnt work on all iPhones.In particular, he said that it doesnt work with iPhone 5s or the newest models. So the FBI cant simply just hack into an iPhone 6s using the tool it just bought.iOS 8 and later comes with encryption features that make it much harder to get access to an iPhones content. But Farooks iPhone was running iOS 9 on an iPhone 5c. So it looks like the tool works with iOS 9, but not on recent iPhones.The iPhone 5c doesnt have a Touch ID sensor or a secure enclave. The first iPhone with a Touch ID sensor was the iPhone 5s. So it could be related to the Touch ID sensor or not.But theres one thing for sure  the FBI hasnt told Apple. Given that the FBI might take advantage of this security hole for future cases, it doesnt want Apple to fix it too quickly.We tell Apple, then theyre going to fix it, then were back where we started from, he said according to CNN. We may end up there, we just havent decided yet.This is a shameful strategy as it exposes the data of millions of iPhone users to hackers and intelligence services around the world. Also, we have to trust the FBIs word because no security expert has seen its method yet. And its hard to trust the FBI after this case
