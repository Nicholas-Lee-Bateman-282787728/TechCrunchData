Update: In an interview, Microsoft indicated that Bing now doesnt lose money. Thats several quarters ahead of its stated public cashflow schedule.Following the news that it will shed around 100 employees to Uber in a mapping technology deal, Microsoft announced this afternoon that it will now power AOLs search property, and will apportion parts of its advertising work into both AOL and AppNexus.AOL, which owns TechCrunch, was recently purchased by Verizon, so it seems that Microsoft and our New Corporate Death Star are now in business together.The move comes with a host of layoffs  reportedly around 1,200  some positions of which will be subsumed into AOL all of which will be offered jobs at AOL.Its worth keeping in mind that Microsoft recently underwent a sharp series of layoffs following its purchase of the majority of Nokias hardware assets.The deal is another plank in Microsofts current, and very vocal attempt to slim its operations and have a more concerted product focus. Todays earlier news that the company is getting out of the mapping imaging world is a similar move by the company; the old joke that an argument that answers everything answers nothing applies, but in this case, the company that does everything does nothing well.Oddly enough, Microsoft said something nice about TechCrunch.

It noted in a blog post that its seen more than 50 percent of business in its Nordic countries turn programmatic, something thats allowing it to take this larger step forward today.Heres the official comment:Todays news is evidence of Microsofts increased focus on our strengths: in this case, search and search advertising and building great content and consumer services. This evolution in our approach to display advertising allows us to keep this focus, while working with industry leaders to market our services.Shares in Verizon, a partner in the deal, are flat after hours. Microsofts own shares are currently up all but unch.
