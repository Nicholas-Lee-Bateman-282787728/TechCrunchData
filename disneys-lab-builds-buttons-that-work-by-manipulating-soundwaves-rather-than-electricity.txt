Im a fan of Disneys research labs. Meant largely to help Disney discover new ways to innovate in their parks and products, its a seemingly endless stream of crazy thinking.Much of what they build and share is really, really cool, but hard to imagine being used by anyone outside of Disney. This crazy robot that draws massive pictures on the beach? Its cool as heck, but unless you own a big stretch of beach to act as a canvas (as Disney does with its resorts), its not super practical.Some things they come up with, though, are great because theyre just so different. So clever.Take, for example, this just released video on what Disneys research hub is calling Acoustruments.The video is a bit slow to start, so a primer: by manipulating soundwaves emitted by your smartphones speaker, theyre able to build buttons/knobs/sliders/etc. that can interact with your device without any power source or wired connection.You launch an app thatemits a tone through your phones speaker. When you push a button or twist a knob, the acoustrument modifies the tone much in the way your finger changes the tone of a flute when it blocks a hole. Push the button, the air pathway changes, the tone changes accordingly. Your phones microphone detects the tone change and reacts accordingly.Why? Imagine an alarm clock that works with any phone, as long as it has a microphone/speaker on the bottom. Or, as demonstrated, a Google Cardboard-esque virtual reality headset with buttons that work with just about any phone, all without power/wires.Like much of what comes out of Disneys research labs, this was built in partnership with Carnegie Mellon.Is it 100 percent practical in all cases? Is anyone going to throw out their soldering iron and go all-acoustic? Of course not. But its clever as all heck  and if youre a builder/tinkerer, its definitely a trick to keep in your arsenal.
