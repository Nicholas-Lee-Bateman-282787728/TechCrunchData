Practo, anIndian startup that provides a search portal matching doctors with patients and other digital services for practices, has closed a $30 million Series B round to expand its services in India and other emerging markets.The fundingwas led by existing investorSequoia Capital with participation from MatrixPartners. Bangalore-based Practoraised $4.6 million in 2012, and closeda seed round in 2011.The companys primary platform is a doctor search portal, which allows patients to look up and book appointments with doctors across six cities in India.That service claims to be Asias top health search portal with120,000 doctors on its platform, and 1.5million visitors and four million searches per month.Outside of India, Practo has fledgling businesses in Singapore (6,0004,300 doctors) and it recently launched in thePhilippines.Practo co-founder and CEOShashank ND told TechCrunch in an interview that the funding will go towards scaling the business to reach 35 cities in India and at least four more international markets this year. Southeast Asia, the Middle East, South Africa and Brazil are among its targets. He anticipates that the companys headcount will rise from 600 today to over 1,500 by the end of 2015.At first glance, the company is akin to a ZocDoc, but actually its business is more sophisticated than merely a search portal. Thats because it also offers a software-as-a-service platform  Practo Ray that managespractices, organizing doctor schedules, collating patient notes, and handling payment, for example.Practos search portal is free for patients and doctors alike. The company makes moneyby licensing Ray, and also through Google-style advertising on the search results within itsconsumer portal.Thatdual approach provides plenty of synergy for the company  doctors and practices wont want to turn away potential traffic from the main Practo service, essentially a free portal, and that hook gives Practo a chance to make money either via ads or Ray.For example, Practo offers doctors who pay for Ray an instant appointment option whichtakes advantage of knowing their schedule to book appointments with patients quickly.Shashank said that around 10 percent of doctors on the Practo India service are signed up for that feature.With smartphone adoption growing faster in India than anywhere else in Asia, the company launched its iOS app this year  having debuted an Android app last year  and nowit sees closeto one-third of activity from mobile devices, withShashank claiming mobile traffic doubled over the past month.The growth of smartphones hasseen a number of patient-doctor apps sprout up, particularly across Southeast Asia, but Practo was actually founded back in 2008.Shashank, then an undergraduate, ran into problems trying to get a second opinion on a hip operation that his father was due to undergo in India.I found it very difficult to get his patient records sent to the specialist in the U.S.. In the end, I needed to scan the records and upload the photos into an email to send over. When I asked the doctor [in India] he told me that his software didnt have an email button, he recalled, laughing.That got Shashank and Practo co-founder and CTOAbhinav Lal started, but the duo have identified far wider possibilities with their company. While it is common for most startup founders in India to focus on the domestic market  thats understandable given Indias billion-plus population  Practo is also keen to grow its international footprint.Ourtop priority is to serve India, and we see short-term growth primarily coming from India, Shashank explained. But, in the long-term, theres a huge opportunity inemerging markets  and we choose to do both.Aside from aggressive domestic and international plans, Practo also plans to expand the scope of its service to coverdiagnosis labs and hospitals. The model will be the same, provide a platform to help people connect directly for appointments and offer software to help manage organizations.With its Series B round banked, the company doesnt have an immediate plans to raise again, butShashank accepted that the business will necessitate furtherinvolvement from VCs for acceleration, even though it is moving towards profitability in India.This is a capital intensive business, we see a lot of potential both in India and other emerging, sowell probably know [about the timing of our Series C round] in a few months, he added.One of the interesting things about covering emerging markets is observing just how many startups are rising out of markets like India and China with business models that are either not matched by companies in Western markets, or wouldnt fitwith industries in the West. In similar fashion to NewsHunt  the news app from India that raised $40 million this weekand is moving towards being a digital marketplace and payments service  Practo is anotheremerging market model that is unique because well, the emerging world and its needs are unique.The U.S.healthcare market is very different to that of India, so solutions will be very different too. In emerging markets, were seeing a different need for technology and how it can help. We aim to build our products to help patients live healthier, and to live longer, Shashank concluded.
