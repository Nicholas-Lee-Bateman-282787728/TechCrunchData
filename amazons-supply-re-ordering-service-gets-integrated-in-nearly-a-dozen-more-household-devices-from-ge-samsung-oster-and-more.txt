Amazon this morning announced a significant expansion of device partners thatwill support its Dash Replenishment Service  the initiative that enables connected household devices to monitor their supply levels and automatically reorder when those supplies run low.For example, printers canreorder ink just before you run out. Your Brita water pitcher canreorder a new filter as the old one goes bad. Today, Amazon says that it has added eleven new brands to the program, includingGeneral Electric, Samsung, August, Gmate, Oster, Obe, Petnet, CleverPet, Sutro, Thync and Sealed Air.The new partners are in addition to the much smaller handful thatwere already participating in the program:Brother, Whirlpool and Brita.With the expansion, consumers will soon be able to buy things like washing machines that automatically order detergent, smart locks that send you replacement batteries, pet food dispensers that ship you new dog food, and more.For theDash Replenishment Service (or DRS) program to work, manufacturers create connected devices that are capable of detecting and measuring consumable usage by way of infrared sensors, scales or other mechanisms, Amazon explains. They then integrate Amazons DRS APIs by adding as few as 10 lines of code to their software, which allows them to connect to Amazons infrastructure to fulfill their customersorders, as needed.For example, GEssmart washer is an ideal candidate for this type of service. Designed to make doing laundry more of an automated experience, the washerautomatically dispenses the right amount of detergent for each load, lets customers work the washer through a mobile app, tracks supply levels, and then orders more detergent when supplies are low.DRSis the same reordering service that also powers Amazons consumer-facing Amazon Dash Buttons, which are the hardware dongles you can mount or hang around your home to reorder everyday supplies like paper towels, trash bags, diapers, and more.With the new brand partners, there are a number of interesting implementations now in the works, including the above-mentioned GE high-efficiency washer; an August Smart Lock whose app will notify you to change your batteries and order them for you; a Gmate SMART Blood Glucose Meter that will reorder testing supplies; severalpet food dispensers from Obe, Oster, Petnet and CleverPetthat measure food and water consumption and reorders the food as needed; Samsung Laser Printers that automatically ship you new toner; a Sutro pool monitor that automatically orders pool chemicals; Thyncs de-stressing wearable that auto-orders new strips; and Sealed Airs hand soap and hand sanitizer dispensers that automatically reorder the soap or sanitizer.At this time,these companies have committed to launching DRS-enabled devices, but products are still arriving to market. An Amazon spokesperson confirms that the first ones will arrivelater this year.
