Update: Samsung has reached out sayingthat the United States is actually not one of the select countries where the Gear 360 will be launching onApril 29. Blargh.Samsung unveiled the Gear 360 virtual reality camera last monthat Mobile World Conference. People were generally impressed, but without a price tag most withheld judgment. Well today onstage at the Samsung Developers Conference, the companyrevealed that the 4K 360-degree cameras will be going on sale April 29 in select countries and..we still dont know the price.We do know the device is retailing for 350 euros in Europe, which is about $400 USD. If Samsung can stick in that general $350-$400 area than this could be a big development.Now, $350-$400 for a little racquetball sized camera sounds pretty expensive (and lets be honest, it is), BUT that amountfor a 4K 360-degree camera is actually a pretty great deal these days. Add in the fact that the Gear 360 plays so nicely with Samsung handsetsand the Gear VR, which is the most popular decently-powered VR headset on the market, and youre left with pretty killer potential for a great VR ecosystem from Samsung.The 153-gram camera hosts a pair of fisheye F2.0 lenses that can capture near-4K (3840 x 1920) quality video or 30 megapixel photos. It can hold up to 128GB of content on its internal microSD slot and canrecord for up to 140 minutes of active use.The camera has some coolplayback features that play wellwith the new Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones. You can live-preview content captured on the Gear 360, and, after recording it, you can opt to save footageto a phone over WiFi for 2D viewing on the mobile app or a true 360 experience through the Gear VR. Past that, you can alsoshare your captured content directly to 360 video-compatible services like YouTube orFacebook.This thing comes out in two days so hopefully we find out the price soon. Given the emphasis Samsung has placed on marketing VR in the US, I wouldnt be shocked to see Samsung drop the price a bit lower than $350-$400 and give all of those new Galaxy owners sporting Gear VR headsets one more reason to buy into virtual reality.
