Have you ever wished you could stand on deck as a 160-foot rocket lands an arms length away from you, after a short trip into space? Yeah, me too, but given the rockets tendency to fall over and dramatically explode in a giant ball of fire, perhaps watching it with a VR headset is a the slightly safer option.SpaceX just shared a gorgeous 360-degree video with the world, and if you happen to have a VR headset, now would be a good time to dig it out and strap it to your noggin; this video is definitely best experienced up close and personal, its quite the spectacle.If youre on mobile, the Facebook player does a pretty good job of showing it off even without a headset, but its available on YouTube as well, if youre so inclined.Landing a rocket on a barge in the ocean is such a tremendous technological success that one cant help but be agape and amazed at the feat. If SpaceX is able to consistently landall  or even most  of its first-stage rockets, it will mean a tremendous reduction in the cost of sending stuff up to the great, star-speckled darkness beyond.Its a fantastically exciting time to be a space fan, for sure. And with that in mind, why not enjoy another view in glorious 4k resolution below, of the same triumphant victory of engineering, ingenuity, and perhaps just a tiny little bit of good fortune thrown into the mix as well.
