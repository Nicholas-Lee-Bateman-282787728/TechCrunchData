Perhaps yourerethinking your go-to-market strategy, leaning towardsChina or Europe instead (if youre from the USA and can even conduct business with your prospects).Well,we believe that this is,in fact, the best time to enter the Russian market.Decreasing Costs Of User AcquisitionEvery crisis turns into economic growth eventually. Leveraging thecurrent economic downturn to finish with the highest user base, or simply following the buy lowrule, could lead you taking it all at the end.For one thing, investments in online marketing are in local currencyand youre paying only half of the previous prices becauseofthe exchange rate slide alone.Anotherpiece of good news is that most Russian companies will decrease advertising spending to savein this tough period and you can get the best inventory on the market with almost nocompetition.More Russians Are Coming OnlineThe Russian population is still about 150million, withinternet penetration of 57% on average (growing rapidly in the regions away from the dominanturban centers). We believe mobile internet domination will come in the next two years,so you have a chance to get nearly 120 millionconnected users on thenew economic wave.Source: FOM, 2014Most Russian Tech StartupsDont Compete GloballyThe lack of revenue and investment meanslocal development is contracting. According to our analysis, purchasing capacity willdrop 75% in the coming months, which will cause a wave of bankruptcy and M&A deals as companies struggle to survive (e-commerce has taken its first punch already, a teasing one for now, but theserious blow is coming).These factors will bring about the ideal circumstances for a foreigner to enter the market withnew business models and products which couldflourish in the current economicsituation (sharing economy, savings, security etc.).The online market in Russia is still young and unsaturated. Globalproducts gain more and more local users if theyre localized properly. And globalization itself still hasan impact. This cant be turned around in one moment.If you bring a better product tothe target audience the demand will come. For example, we use Slack, GitHub, Dropbox,LinkedIn and Duolingo not because we dont have local analogs  we actually do  but becauseforeign products are craftedso well that its financially andemotionally costly to switch to anythingelse.To give you some context, lets recall the super-ambitious initiative of the government-heldRostelecom to launch a patriotic search engine, Sputnik, almost a year ago  with annual costs ofnearly $20 million by some estimates. After months of effort from the team (read: money andpropaganda), Sputnik accounts for about 850 thousand total visits per month, compared to 1.5 billionforYandex (which holds 62% of the market) and 644 millionfor Google.Bargain Hunting For TalentLay-offs of up to 30% are expected, and so international companies can have the hugeadvantage of being boss to the best minds inthe market.You also can think about hiring developers in Russia as well. It might sound crazybutsince a lot of ambitious start-ups will fold in the coming months with no sources of revenue or investment, the brightest minds will be available and you can get the best engineers forthe price of $18-25thousandper-year.Lyft, for instance, is already out headhunting, proposing stock options, relocation and other perks.Chinese Companies Are Moving FirstChina is a big brother to Russia not because of the Communist unity of the past, but simplybecause its close enough and Russias geography is immense. Even in Russia, half of thecountry doesnt really know that if you go to its Eastern provincesyou can barely see any Russianproducts  everything is imported from China and these territories are infact more Chinese than Russian as the Slavic population thins out. This, and the similarmentality of both nations, have resulted in Chinese apps and handsets flooding the marketacross Russia.Chinaspresence continues to grow dramatically. Huawei now competes with Cisco to controlstate purchases. Dolphin Browser (a Chinese mobile browser backed by Sequoia Capital) forAndroid grew fast, reaching 12 millionusers within a couple of years andwith no marketingefforts. Dolphins management has the right idea, increasing its local presence and scalingits success in user acquisition and monetization of 150 millionusers in Russia now.Moreover, AliExpress is opening its first pick-up point in Russia. And its pricingiswinning the hearts of Russias regional populations through pricing.Chinas trendy Xiaomi hasnt blinked either, declaring its intention to enter the market this year.Xiaomi could become a market leader pretty easily since last year the sector overachiever,British low-cost brand Fly (Meridian Telecom Group), overtook Nokia and Apple in Q1 and thenalmost got Samsung in Q4.Sources: Evroset Retail Chain, GFK.Svyaznoy Retail Chain reports the sales of devices cheaper than 5 000 RUR ($75) haveincreased from 20% in 2012 to 33% in 2013 and reached 42% in 2014. We believe this sharewill spike to 55% in 2015.Alot of low-cost smartphones and feature phones are illegally importedfrom Asia (we call it the gray market), but you can leverage this disruption by dealing with theexporters on pre-installs of your app.The Competition May Be Coming?Yes, its crazy here and you might be banned from the country, but usually what you hear is justmedia overreaction. For now, there are no major precedents for tech businesses being kickedout for political reasons.The level of risk of expulsion you face depends on the type of the business you run, though, andwed recommend you do some market research in advance and apply some common sensetoo. For instance, you might agree that it does not sound like a brilliant idea to launch a newpolitical media outlet for Russians.However, a team of ex-Lenta (a leading online mediaoperation shut down over a content policy issue) employees entered the market three monthsago with a brand new outlet, Meduza, focusing on social-political news and Russian reportage(they have an English version too). Today they reach 1.3mln readers monthly and this is by farthe fastest growth in the industry in Russia so far.Lower Regulatory Barriers To Entry Than Other Emerging MarketsYou dont have to receive certification for your software in Russia, as you do in China or some other emerging markets.In Russia, enter the market with an offering, which is comparable to local pricing or even cheaper (if not forfree).

Some of them have quite high barriers anddemand a lot of long-term investments. Long-term is a tricky word in Russia; we dont havesuch a thing really. Just keep this in mind.If youre Palantir, (or not, but your revenue also comes from state purchases) be ready to find astrong local partner with strong GR skills (read: a lot of banya and vodka-based activities).And you can buy intellectual rights, patents and teams for small sums($100,00 to $3 milion) inRussia. Its not always an acqui-hire from the local point of view, and both sides of the deal will behappy.
