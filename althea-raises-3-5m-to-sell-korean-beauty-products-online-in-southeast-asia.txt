Althea, a Korea-based company that exports and sells cosmetics and beauty products to Southeast Asia, hasclosed a $3.5 million Series A round for expansion.A report co-authored by Google this weektipped Southeast Asias internet economy togrow six-fold to reach $200 billion annually in the next decade, with e-commerce setto accountfor over 40 percent of that figure. But, with a cumulative population of over 600 million, the region is already seen as lucrative opportunityfor many online retailers  among them,Alibaba recently invested $1 billion in Rocket Internet-backed Lazada.Althea, which was launchedin July 2015, aims to take advantage of the popularity of Korean culture  such as K-Pop and Korean drama series  in the region. Founded by ex-Ticket Monster duoFrank Kang and Christopher Cynn alongside CFOJae Yoon Kim, the Korean startup sells to consumers inIndonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Philippines with plans to enter Southeast Asias two other major markets  Thailand and Vietnam  before the end of this year.This new funding round is provided by a range of investors that includeMirae Asset Ventures, Posco Ventures, 500 Startups, Tekton Ventures and Cherubic Ventures with the aim of carrying out that market expansion, adding to the companys 25 staff with new hires, and investing inmarketing and logistics.There are plenty of companies also exporting Korean beauty products. The most notable example is Memebox, which graduated Y Combinator and has raised close to $30 million from investors, but Memebox is focused on Western markets while Althea is looking only at Southeast Asia for now.The startup prides itself on bringing new products to market in Southeast Asia first thanks to a sourcing team on the ground in Korea, CEO Frank Kang told TechCrunch in an interview. Thats important for beauty brands in Korea, which Kang pegs at 10,000, because they need a dedicated route to overseas sales.Our plan is to really build a brand, so were really focused on trendy items with a lot of potential [and] products that have not been introduced yet, Kang explained. The aim is to be the number one marketing generation platform for Korean brands in Southeast Asia.The past year of work seems to be going well, with Althea claiming 500,000 monthly unique visitors and an annualized run rate of over $10 million in revenue. The company said it is growing at 30 percent per month and is on track to reach profitability by the end of this year.Althea, whichhas an office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but exports all products directly out of Korea, is solely focused on Southeast Asia for now, but Kang admitted that it could expand its horizons in the future.Our business is scalable so we can consider any market and any country, but we want to focus on Southeast Asiabecause it is the second largest region for Korean exports behind only China. We really want to conquer this market first [since the]competition is stronger in China and the U.S., he said.We need to grow to scale first, then we could consider other parts of the world but thats the long term future, Kang added.More immediately, Althea plans to introduce its own label products by earlynextyear.The company is in the early stages of working on this now, butKang admitted that the startup will probably need to raise another round of funding in order to bring its own brand to market.
