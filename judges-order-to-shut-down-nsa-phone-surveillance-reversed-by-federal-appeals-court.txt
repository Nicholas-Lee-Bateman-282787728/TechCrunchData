A federal appeals court has just ruled againsta 2013 decisionorderingtheNSA to stop its bulk metadata collection program.The three-judge panelissued its ruling Friday, contending that conservative privacy activist Larry Klaymanhad not adequately argued the likeliness that his owndata had been collected as a part of the metadata collection program.Judge Stephen Williams wrote that the plaintiffsclaim to suffer from government collection of records from their telecommunications provider relating to their calls. But plaintiffs are subscribers of Verizon Wireless, not of Verizon Business Network Services, Inc.the sole provider that the government has acknowledged targeting for bulk data collection.Judge Janice Rogers Browns separateopinion stated that the plaintiffs had failed to show a concrete and particularized injury in regards to the NSA program. Brown ended her opinion quoting Daniel P. Moynihans book Secrecy: The American Experience.Regulations of this sort may frustrate the inquisitive citizen but that does not make them illegal or illegitimate. Excessive secrecy limits needed criticism and debate. Effective secrecy ensures the perpetuation of our institutions.This court decisions importance really isnt as critical as it would have beenbefore the recent legislation passed in Congress,as todays ruling is more procedural and doesnt touch on the programs constitutionality. The law passed by Congress allows bulk phone data collection to continue until the end of the year, but it severely scales back the NSAs phone surveillanceprogramthereafter.
