In this episode of Foundation, I sit down with a long-time mentor and friend, Leo Laporte. Leo was the star of TechTV and is the founder of TWiT. We discuss his early days as a fry cook at McDonalds, how the concept of This Week in Tech was born, and the importance of keeping a positive attitude.Leos advice for aspiring entrepreneurs:Im lucky for one thing. I do what Im really interested in. I never burn any bridges. I always did my best work. I never got resentful. I kept one foot in front of the other, and always try to remember that we have a mission. Our mission is to educate and inform people about technology so they can improve their lives and have more fun. And thats worked pretty well.Editors note: Kevin Rose is a co-founder of North Technologies and an advisor at Google Ventures. You can watch Kevins prior Foundation episode, an interview with chef Jamie Oliver, here.
