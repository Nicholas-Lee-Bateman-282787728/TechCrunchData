Google unveiled two new Nexus phones, an updated version of its Chromecast dongle and an audio-only version of the Chromecastat a press event in San Francisco today. This was Googles largest dedicated hardware event to date, and we spent some quality time with all of the new devices.The metal-clad Nexus 6P definitely feels like a premium device. It still has a bit of heft to it, but because its a little bit smaller, it feels much better in the hand than the somewhat oversized older Nexus 6. Officially, its a tiny bit lighter than the previous model, but I doubt youd notice much of a difference. The AMOLED screen looked great, but wed have to spend a bit more time with it in real-world conditions to really draw any conclusions about it. At the event, it looked very sharp and seemed to render colors nicely, but youd expect that from a quad-HD screen.Within the controlled environment of the event venue, the camera seemed to work really well, but we werent able to do any low-light tests yet, for example.Compared to the new Nexus 6P, the smaller Nexus 5X clearly doesnt quite feel as premium  mostly because in comparison to the metal Nexus 6P, the plastic housing of the 5X is obviously a bit of a letdown. For about $130 less than the 6P, this is still a phone to be reckoned with, especially because it shares its camera tech with the larger phone.The first thing youll probably notice about the device is that it feels very light.Given that it has a 2,400 mAh battery, thats actually surprising. The 1080p screen wont blow you away, but its perfectly fine.Which one should you get? We havent spent enough time with either of them to give you a recommendation just yet, but well review both phones once we get our review units. From the timeI spent with them, though, Id probably go for the 6P. Unlike the last Nexus 6, this one doesnt feel as bulky  and for me, that was the main reason why I kept my old Nexus 5 around until now.
