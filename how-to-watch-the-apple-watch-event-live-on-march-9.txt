Its almost certain Apples March 9 event will provide specifics about the upcoming April launch of the Apple Watch, but you can find out for yourself by tuning in to a live video feed Apple will provide for the event that starts at 10 AM PT.All youll need is Apples dedicated live events site, and a recent version of Safari running on OS X, or on iOS. You can also stream directly to your Apple TV, so long as its a second- or third-generation device with Apple TV OS version 6.2 or higher.As usual, Apple is limiting official access to its own hardware and software, but it isnt too surprising that the company would have platform expectations in place that reward those most likely to be excited about the event in the first place.In case the live video stream experiences technical challenges, or youd rather get some commentary and silence along with your news, well also be providing live updates on the ground from the show at Yerba Buena in San Francisco, complete with photos and text. We realize some employers arent thrilled about work time video watching, so weve got your back.
