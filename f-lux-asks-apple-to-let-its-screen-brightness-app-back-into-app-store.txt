As manynoted when Apple released its beta version of iOS earlier this week, one of the mobile operating systems newest features, a nighttime reading mode with reduced blue light emissions, looked awfully familiar. The ability to adjust the screen brightness on iOS devices is something software makerF.lux has been developingfor years. Its technology, which even briefly worked on iOS without jailbreaking, lets users adjust the screens lighting for daytime and nighttime use.Now that a similar technology which Apple dubs Night Shift is an official feature in iOS 9.3, F.luxis calling on Apple to allow itsapp back into the iTunes App Store.In case youre unfamiliar with the problem: studies have shown that blue light keeps peoples pineal gland from releasing melatonin  something which normally occurs a couple of hours before bedtime. This hormone reduces alertness and helps signal to the body that its time to sleep. But as we cuddle up with our smartphones and tablets before bed these days  as opposed tobooksor magazines  were inadvertently making it more difficult on ourselves to fall asleep.F.lux also notes that research points to links between this exposure to light at night and cancer, referencing reports that statedisruption of our circadian rhythms by way of night shift work or disturbed sleep-wake cycles may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer and other diseases, for example.The company was among one of the original pioneers in the software space with a solution to this problem. Its app, originally designed back in 2009, now works on a range of devices, including Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and iOS devices, if theyre jailbroken (meaning, a way to hack the device to run unapproved applications.)In November 2015, the company released an open-source version of its iOS application, which was a brief, but welcome respite from the need to jailbreak your device in order to take advantage of itssoftware. The iOS app offers settings thatadjust your screens color temperature. Unfortunately, F.lux had to quickly pull its download link, asthe app was in violation of Apples Developer Agreement.The problem with side-loaded version wasnt really the method of installation  Apple now lets anyone with an Apple ID load apps directly from Xcode  but rather with F.luxs use of private APIs.However, with Night Shift now officially supported as an iOS feature, F.lux believes its app should be allowed back into the App Store. That is, Apple should open up access to those private APIs so that the app is no longer in violation of Apples terms.A good handful of iOS users agree  following the ban, over 5,000 F.lux fans signeda petition asking Apple to reconsider its position.Its a reasonable request, now thanks to Night Shift. If Apple is officially offering a feature that will automatically shift the colors in its display to the warmer end of the spectrum at a given time, it seems there would be little harm in allowing a third-party to build on top of that functionality to offer a more advanced feature set to power users.Of course, while F.lux deserves credit for being an early solution provider for this issuewithblue light emissions from our computing devices, addressing the problem is something that the device makers are now solving for themselves. Amazon, for example, recently rolled out a similar Blue Shade feature for Kindle devices, and Google introduced a blue light filter in its Play Books application just last month, too.In addition, its worth noting that there are a number of third-party applicationsthat offer the same blue light reduction functionality on the Google Play store today, indicating there is a market for third-party software in this space.However, its not uncommon for Apple to borrow ideas from the jailbreak community, having taken inspiration from a number of unapproved tweaks in years past, to do thing like enhance notifications, implement Wi-Fi sync, add support for widgets and dynamic wallpapers, improve multitasking and app organization, and more.Image credit, top: 9to5Mac.com
