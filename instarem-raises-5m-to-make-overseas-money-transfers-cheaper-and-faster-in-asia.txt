InstaRem, an international remittance payments startup headquarteredin Singapore, has raised $5 million in a round led by Vertex Ventures.The Series A investment included participation fromFullerton Financial Holdings, an investment fund that, like Vertex, is a subsidiary of Singapores sovereign wealth fund Temasek, and existing investorGlobal Founders Capital.A wave of fintech companies are promising to liberate bank customers from painof international transfers, which come with sub-market exchange rates and hefty processing fees.While the likes of TransferWise, which was founded by Skype alumni and is backed by famed U.S. investment firm Andreessen Horowitz among others, offer better exchange rates and lower fees, the usual cross-border service takes days and has limited support worldwide.Thats where InstaRem hopesto stand out from the crowd.The company is focused on serving Asia, and it claims tocharge lower fees than banks and traditional remittance services like MoneyGram or Western Union  InstaRems rate is typically less than one percent  while transactions are completed within one day, if not same-day.The service started out serving Australia. InstaRemisnt saying how many customers it has,but co-founder and CEOPrajit Nanusaid it has already captured two percent of the countrys payments corridor to India in just over one year of operations.He added that theaverage transaction size is $1,800  multiples higher than typical remittance companies  while InstaRem sees 60 percent repeat trade, and 80 percent of new customer accounts make a transfer within the first five days of registering.Companies like TransferWise usemyriadbank accounts to funnel money across borders using different customer transactions as the float. InstaRem, by contrast, uses more traditional means. It works with mid-size banks that already trade in overseas currencies. Its the financial equivalent of putting a few boxes on a UPS freighter thats about to head out,thus paying just a sliver of the costs youd incur if you had to find a boat and ship it yourself.Banks might seem like they are being cut out here. But the cross-border payments represent a fraction of their overall business, whilemid-sizeestablishments are interested in companies like InstaRem, Nanu explained, because they have the potential to bring themtransaction volumes.The company holds financial licenses inAustralia, Hong Kong and Canada, and it said it is in the process of applying in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Luxembourg (which opensbanks across Europe) and anumber of U.S. states. That said, according to Nanu, the focus will largely be on [serving customers in] Asia.Beyond just individuals  such as expats and first-generation migrants wanting to send money home  InstaRem also works with SMEs, which make up around 20 percent of its customer base. While non-business customers tend to appreciate the cost savings, Nanu said that business customers are also keen onthe faster transaction times.Some of our SME customers Ithought used us for price, but one told us recently that a primary reason is because they can sit on invoice longer than with a bank, he recalled.In other words, one-day overseas transfershelp small business owners with theircash flow because they can hold on to their money untiljust before it is due.InstaRem currently has 20 staff and is anchored in Singapore, with offices inSydney, Singapore, Mumbai and New Jersey. Nanu is targeting volumes of $100 million per month before the end of the year, as the company and its service ramps up to include more markets, which he said will include more remote places like Nepal and Bhutan as well as more obvious markets.InstaRem is currently working ona range of new products, targeting unbanked populations in South Asia and tapping intoits mesh network to offer new services to banks. The latter is one area where its relationship withFullerton, which made its first investment in a tech startup with this deal, could pay dividends since it holds investments inbanks across Southeast Asia.
