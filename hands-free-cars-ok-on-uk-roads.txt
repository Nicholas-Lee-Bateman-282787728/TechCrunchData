A U.K. government review into automatedvehicleshas published its findings in a reportout today,giving thegreen light for driverless car technologies to be tested on public roads.The report concludes thereare no current legal and regulatory barriers to prevent testsof automated vehicles where an individual is ready to take control of the car if necessary.So, to be clear, this is not yet a green light for U.K. roads to be filled with fully autonomous robot overlords sans anyqualified human on hand to take the wheel if necessary. The government notes that sort of full automation is likely far further out (at least the 2020s).Itsearly focusfor this report has therefore been on vehicles designed to allow thedriver to disengage from the task of driving, aka hands free driving. This makes sense given that fully autonomous vehicles are indeed lurking much further down the road, involving fargreater levels of complexity across the board  fromthe tech itself to a sympathetic and supportive regulatory landscape.When it comes toshort to medium termstepping stone vehicle automationtechnologies, whichthe government sees asmoving societycloser to the ultimate scenario of a vehicle which is completelydriverless', itsreview notes:Those wishing to conduct tests in the UK are not limited to the testtrack or certain geographical areas, do not need to obtain certificatesor permits, and are not required to provide a surety bond (providedthey have insurance arranged).Now this is a little bit of a so-what finding, given that automated parking assistance features are already implemented in cars on U.K. roads. And cruise control, which lets drivers give theirfoot a break from the accelerator pedal when on the motorway, has been around for decades.However the report dubs those technologies driver assistance systems, notingthey still involve the driver needing to remain alert in case they are required to take over the controls again. Whereasit is concernedwith what it dubs higher levels of automation  akasystems that are designed to allow the driver to completely disengage from thedriving task and undertake other tasks.(The reports use of the term full automation, meanwhile, refers to truly driverless cars  a technology that cant legally be tested on public roads in the U.K. yet, but can be trialled at dedicated testing centers, as noted below).The next step in the governments driverless tech acceleration plan is for itto introduce a code of practice  to provideindustry with the framework they need to trial cars in real-life scenarios, and to create more sophisticated versions of the models that already exist.Itsays it expects this code to bepublished shortly, in spring 2015.Last summer the U.K.published its first official robotics strategy whichcalled for the establishmentof real-world test sites over the next five+ years forkicking the tyresof robotics and autonomous systems.While, back in December 2013, when the government announced it would be reviewingtheregulatory landscape to pave the way for driverless cars, it alsoannounceda 10 million prize fund for a town or city to develop as a testing ground for driverless cars.The fund has since been upped to 19 million,andLondons Greenwich, MiltonKeynes, Coventry and Bristol selected as the test site winners last December.The government says itexpects the first driverless cars supported by this prize fund to be tested at those sitesthis summer  such as the two autonomous vehicles pictured below, set for testingin Milton Keynes and Greenwich respectively.Todaysreport also notes that the government intends to work with devolved administrations within the U.K. to reviseand amend legislation to support the introduction of automated vehicle technologies, and also at the European level  noting it willliaise at an international level with an aim toamend international regulations by the end of 2018.Areas where the government says it sees the need for legal and regulatory tweaks to support driverless developments are three-fold:Commenting on todaysreport in a statement, the U.K.sTransport Minister, Claire Perry, said: I want Britain to be at the forefront of this exciting new development, to embrace a technology that could transform our roads and open up a brand new route for global investment.These are still early days but today is an important step. The trials present a fantastic opportunity for this country to take a lead internationally in the development of this new technology, she added.
