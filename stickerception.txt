Stickers. Theyre big in Asia and going global, dont you know? Line, a company that makes more than $10 million per month from selling themand also lets regular peoplesubmit designs, has so many packs that it created a new app that specifically helpsyou find new ones.If you thinkFacebooks standalone app for addingstickers to your photosis overkill, then the Line Stickers app for iOS and Android is most definitely not for you.The app serves up over a million stickers, letting Line users tag the ones they like with phrases. Tagged stickers show up in a feed of Line users fromeach country, allowingothers tovote on them, leave comments and tag friends.The idea  it appears  is that you can peruse your feed for new sticker ideas, and head to the store if you find one you like.Big caveat though: the initial selectioninside the app are paid-for and come from its thriving Creators Market, as far as I can tell.So cheapskates like yours truly wont have much joy here, but I guess you can feel good for supporting indie stickerists with your cash.Id like this app if I could do things, such as post stickers to Line chats or annotatethem for future use.But you cant.This app is only useful if you have a sticker fetish and dont mind opening your wallet to fund it.Line also hasa selfie sticker app but personally I think its most notable contribution is preloading stickers and emoji as you type.That development has madeactually having to open the in-chatdraw to add a new sticker an arduous task. It goes without saying then, that having to download and open a standalone app just to find stickers that you need to buy isa ridiculous proposition to most of Lines 500 million registered users. Or maybe its just me
