Editors note:Fayez Mohamood is aco-founder and CEO of Bluecore.Every New Year, I pick a new hobby  yoga, sailing, something I dont know how to do  and in 2011, I chose improv comedy. I was absolutely terrified. On day one, I stood onstage and talked with a stranger about hiking for 10 minutes. At the end, 10 strangers critiqued every little thing I did. They told me quirks about my posture, tone and body language that my best friends wouldnt dare to say. Within a year, I was performing weekly in amateur improv shows.I began to realize that improv for entrepreneurs was akin to weight lifting for professional football players, minus most of the grunting. It is a training regimen that transforms people into their most powerful and effective selvesin a startup environment. It can take a shy software engineer whos never talked to a client and turn him into the companys best salesperson.In 2013, Mahmoud Arram and I co-founded Bluecore, a marketing technology company whereevery single employee is required to complete an improv 101 class within the first four months on the job. In terms of importance, this ranks right up there with required reading and sales training. But why?Improv is unconventional training designed to build a team that can own the ambiguity, frenetic pace, interpersonal challenges and harsh feedback of startup life. There are five parallels between startups and improv that make these classes so effective at building up employees and company culture:Improv has taught to me to view entrepreneurship not merely as something we do, but rather as a skill that needs to be conditioned outside the office. Whether your culture is thriving or struggling, I challenge you to sign up your team for a six-week improv class. I dare you to push your comfort zone and see what happens.
