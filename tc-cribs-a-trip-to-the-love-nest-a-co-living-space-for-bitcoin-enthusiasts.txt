This is a bit of an experimental Cribs episode this week. Stretch your wings and expand your understanding of life in startup land as I take you on a journey over to the Love Nest, a technology commune made mostly of bitcoin stars in Palo Alto, California.The Love Nest is a little Burning Man, a little startup incubator. Friends, co-founders and what the house calls tech nomads gather to work and play in the houses many rooms.Youll see people doing early morning yoga in the backyard or enjoying a late night hangout in the hot tub. Theres a tea room, a meditation room, bunk beds for those passing through, an emphasis on a vegan lifestyle and of course, an homage to Elon Musk in the bathroom.Many of the members of the house came from the infamous Startup Castle. There were a lot of weird rules at that place and when the landlady shut it down, a handful of the tenants wound up at the Love Nest.I met up with Love Nest papa and founder of the bitcoin crowdfunding platform Swarm Joel Dietz to take a tour. Check out the video above for a birds eye view into this quintessentialSilicon Valley co-living space.
