Riding the coattails of a small pieces, loosely joined approach to the enterprise, Belgium startup PieSync offers a platform that connects a plethora of cloud applications and syncs contacts stored in those apps two-way. Thats no mean feat considering the risk of data corruption or overwriting an important contacts information, which is why, says PieSync, companies are warming to the companys proposition.VCs appear to like the product, too, seeing PieSync raise $1.6 million in new funding. The round is being led by Ark Angels Activator Fund and SOFI (PMV). The startup had previous raised a small amount of angel funding as well as going through the Belgian incubator iMind.The SaaS space is fragmenting: there are thousands of SaaS applications out there, and a typical SME deploys on average 7-8 different apps. Thats creating a lot of problems to keep data consistent between those different apps, says PieSync co-founder and CEO Ewout Meyns.Also, its not easy for individual SaaS companies to solve syncing. Its technically hard to do it right, and the solution needs to be able to cope with many different data structures and changing APIs, detect changes, match similar contacts (to prevent duplicates), and merge information.Meyns concedes, however, that other companies are tackling the same problem, but reckons none are going as far and wide as PieSync. A lot of SaaS offer integrations with a handful of other SaaS platforms, but no SaaS is interested in offering integrations with hundreds of sometimes overlapping solutions. That makes syncing a perfect pain to solve, he says.To that end, PieSync says its built technology that allows it to quickly add new platforms with very different data structures, enabling all of the SaaS offerings it supports to talk to one another. We can add a new solution in a day or two, says Meyns.PieSync already supports syncing with 16 apps including Podio, Pipedrive, Mailchimp, Google Contacts, Nimble, OnePageCRM, and SalesForce, to name a few. It says its adding more apps each month.The startup, which charges a monthly subscription for the service, says its typical customers are teams that use multiple cloud applications, but who are struggling to keep contact data synchronised between, for example, a sales platform like SalesForce, a marketing platform like Mailchimp, and contacts stored in an individuals work Gmail.
