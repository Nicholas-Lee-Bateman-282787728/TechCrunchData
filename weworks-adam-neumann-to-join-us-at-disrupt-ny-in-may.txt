WeWork is just about five years old, and in five years has grown to be one of the biggest real estate companies in the world, with a valuation north of $5 billion. Given the tremendous growth of the company, alongside WeWorks ability to combine technology with physical space, made CEO Adam Neumann a perfect fit for the Disrupt NY Stage. Were very pleased to announce that hell be joining us on the main stage for an interview during the conference, going down May 4  6. WeWork started out as a service that allowed startups and entrepreneurs to rent a very small amount of physical space to use as an office. Over time, theyve grown to 31 locations across the globe, servicing cities like New York, DC, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami, alongside a number of international locations in England, the Netherlands, and Israel. But the WeWork folks would be the first to tell you that they dont measure success by square footage, but rather by the number of people that are part of the WeWork community, which has now topped 20,000 people. Part of this success is due to the fact that WeWork integrates technology, such as an internal social network for community members, that not only helps with user acquisition but leads to retention of those users even after theyve outgrown WeWork. Plus, with 20k members, WeWork has the ability to negotiate benefits with large corporations as if they themselves are a 20k person company, as opposed to a company with a few hundred employees and 20,000 tenants. Were thrilled to have Neumann joining us in a few weeks on stage. Adam Neumann will join other notable Disrupt NY speakers, including TindersSean Rad, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, and Vines Jason Mante.The show runs May 4-6 at the historic Manhattan Center.
