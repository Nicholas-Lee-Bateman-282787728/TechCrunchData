Microsoft has a grip of Windows 10 versions on tap, it revealed today, most importantly noting that the smartphone-friendly build of the operating system will be called Windows 10 Mobile.The software company has made repeated mentions of the idea that Windows 10 is a single platform, capable of serving any number of device form factors. Thats true, but the company has tuned the operating in a number of ways.(For an early look at Windows 10 Mobile in action, head here.)Here the breakdown:Microsoft confirmed in its blog post that Windows 10 is still on track to become generally available sometime this summer.According to the firm, the number of people testing Windows 10 has scaled to 3.9 million. The company has repeatedly updated that number, which it evidently views as strong.I had hoped that Microsoft was just going to call the damn thing Windows 10, but it seems that naming schemes of histories past were a bit too much to slough off.
