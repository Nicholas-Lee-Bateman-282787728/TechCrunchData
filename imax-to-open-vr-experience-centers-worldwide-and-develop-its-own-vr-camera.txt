IMAX, one company that has more than done its part to pushcinema technology forward, is preparing to toss its hat into the virtual reality ringwith a set of new initiatives.Following Google I/O, the firm revealed its plan to develop the IMAXVR camera, a cinema-grade virtual reality (VR) camera that will enable producers to shoot 360 degree, 3D content. The cinema tech giantis working with Google on the project, which will use its Jump platformand is expected to take 18 months to bedeveloped. Given the specs, itll be an industry camera that isnt for consumers  unless you want to part with seriousamounts of cash.Beyond that, IMAXsaid also that it will provide Google with existing cinematic footage for conversion into VR content.Aside from bringing VR footage to screens, IMAXis also looking to bring VR screens to people.The firm is workingto introduce VR experiences in malls and other public places, according to the Wall Street Journal. In other words, places where anyone can get access to a VR headset to play games or watch videos.Through an alliance with Sweden-based Starbreeze  which is down to provide headsets and games  IMAXplans to launchVR centers in six locations worldwide, starting out withLos Angeles, before expanding to China and other places.That plan ties in with the VR camera, since IMAXaimsto encouragefilmmakers to create VR content that canbe broadcast at these VRlocations.VR as a content form could be transformative to the media industry, but there remain fundamental issues with distribution. As was mentioned at a panel session at our recent Disrupt event, the form factor and cost of a headset limits it to early adopters and those with disposable income, while the idea that it is left at home also limitspotential usage scenarios. Mobile VR addresses some of those problems but it also presents different kinds of challenges, since devices are tethered to less a powerful machine, subject to battery life concernsand other mobility factors.IMAXsVR experience centers wontsolve the distribution challenge but they could make VRmore accessible, which in turn could raise awareness and bringthe benefits to more people. At the minimum, it sounds like we can expect new (and kickass) film experiences in the future and that should get you excited.
