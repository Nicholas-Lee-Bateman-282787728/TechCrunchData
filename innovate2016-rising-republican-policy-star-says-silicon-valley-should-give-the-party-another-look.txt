Andrew Keen is the author of three books: Cult of the Amateur, Digital Vertigo and The Internet Is Not The Answer. He produces Futurecast, and is the host of Keen On. After Sarah Palins bizarre embrace of Donald Trump this week, not everyone associates the Republican Party with deep thinkers.But Lanhee Chen, one of the Republican Partys rising policy stars, reminds us that the brains can be found on the right as well as the left of American politics. Chen was Mitt Romneys major policy advisor in the 2012 Presidential election and, as a fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institute, remains very influential within the party as, amongst other things, a senior advisor to Marco Rubio.Like RNC Strategy Director Sean Spicer, Chen believes that economic innovation is the natural home of the Republican Party. And like Spicer, Chen argues that Silicon Valley needs to look more closely at the Republicans  with their focus on the free market  as its natural home. Given Chens commitment to the sharing economy and many of the other disruptive features of the digital revolution, this is a compelling argument  especially if (and its a big if, of course) a moderate, pro innovation candidate like Rubio should happen to win the nomination.Many thanks to CALinnovatesand Lincoln Initiative for their help in producing this interview with Lanhee Chen.
