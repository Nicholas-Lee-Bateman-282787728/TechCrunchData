Los Angeles Uber riders, rejoice. UberX is finally coming to LAX.The companyannounced that as of 8 a.m. tomorrow, riders will be able to request and get picked up by UberX cars.This comes exactly one month after Lyft launched at LAX, which was originally announced by LAs Mayor Eric Garcetti.Uber and Lyft had battled for months with the airport and the LA city council to reach an agreement that allowed pickups at the airport.Similar to the setup at SFO, UberX cars will join Lyft by picking uppassengers at designated spots on the departures level, instead of at arrivals.Uber Black and Uber SUV rides (both driven by TCP-licensed drivers) will continue to pick up passengers at arrivals.For this convenience, LAX is charging asurcharge of $4 per UberX pickup and drop-off, a dollar lower than the $5 fee the airport charges licensed Uber Black drivers.Earlier this week I requested aLyft as my ride home from the airport, and the experience still has somekinks that need to be worked out.It seems drivers are still trying to figure out the month-old system, and it took me a few requests to find a driver who was willing to pick me up.Plus thereare only a few designated ride-share pickup locations, and youll most likely have to trek outside of your arrival terminalto find one.Ultimately, its great to have another affordable pickup option at LAX, even if its notyetas seamless as a pickup by a traditional TCP-licensed black car.
