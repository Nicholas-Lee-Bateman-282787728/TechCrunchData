Happy Sunday! Ready to have your mind blown?By mixing ultra-bright projectors and advanced facial tracking with some damned fine visual design, these guys are able to use their faces as a canvas some truly wild work.Watch on as they morph from human, to alien, to cheetah, to robot overlord on the fly.So how does it work? To oversimplify it: an array of cameras tracks the dots on their faces, akin to the way Hollywood motion capture systems work. They then take some truly amazing texture/animation work and digitally morph it around a model of each guys face  essentially making a mask of light  and project it onto their skin in real time.This is actually the second time this group  OMOTE, an artist collective out of Japan  has pulled off something along these lines. While this latest video kicks it up a notch over that first one (if only because theyre hacking two faces, instead of one), the first one is still absolutely worth watching:With a bit more (totally hard and not at-all-trivial) work, its easy to imagine a system like this being used in live entertainment. Imagine a deadmau5/daft punk style EDM artist who uses this to morph his mask in real time, perhaps based on the song being played. Uhng.
