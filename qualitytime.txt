Running out of stuff to quantify? Never fear! A new app launching today on Android promises to quantify your deviceuse by serving up a usage timeline right to your lockscreen so you can be horrified at how many times youve unlock your phone today, or bythe amountof life-minutes youve squandered onFacebook.ZeroDesktop, the startup behind the QualityTime app,has previously made an app for parents to manage their kids device usage, called DinnerTime,as well as crowdfunding an Android computer for families called the MiiPC.President and co-founder, Richard Sah, says the team sees two main markets for QualityTime: people who are worried about over-using their devices, andalso thosewho are just curious, and want to tracktheir app usage.The teamsearlier kids-focused app apparently sparked the idea for QualityTime  after they got feedback from adultsasking for something similar to self helpthemselves. And presumably to contributeto domestic harmony.We found that there were adults using [DinnerTime] (i.e. partners using it on each other, friends using it on each other), Sah tells TechCrunch. We know that adults can also experience excessive app usage addiction  but observing parents and friends using it to help each other really raised our interest in this area.QualityTimelets users set custom usage alerts to help manage how long they spend on their deviceand/or particular apps. It can even be set up to lock the screen for set periods of time. Which might help nix arguments between couples about device usage at bedtime, for example.The app willalso integrate with IFTTT  functionality thats coming later this month. So, for instance, excessive Facebooking could be set up to turn your Philips Hue lightbulbs deep blue. Or more than 500 unlocks in aday could result in an auto dial to your significant other for a pre-agreed ear-bashing. Or add a shame note to your Google Calendar.Whether over relianceon techis bestmanaged by reliance on more tech to provide background warnings/notifications is up for debate. But at this point in thedigitalevolution strata its apps all the way down.Indeed, QualityTime itself follows in the phone-usage quantifying footsteps of BreakFree, Checky, Momentto name three similar services. Thats presumably a sign of something. Growing concern about app addiction is one possibility. Nothing new under the app sun, with major app stores having passed the one million apps mark, isanother. And/or the speed with which adigital ideacan proliferate and be cloned or tweaked is yet a third.There is a big appetite for this kind of product, as mobile/app addiction is such a widespread problem, says Sah. The difference [between QualityTime and rival apps] is that ZeroDesktop is leveraging its cloud-based solution expertise to create a family of products in this arena.Weve accumulated data based on user feedback following the launch of the DinnerTime Plus app, and used this to build on the app development for QualityTime, ensuring that the user experience is the priority. ZeroDesktop want to provide not just a single app, but holistic solutions  a family of products and tools for various ages.For a little general context on app usage, a recentyear-end report from app analytics firm Flurry foundoverallapp usage grewby 76% in 2014.Top app categories included Shopping, Utilities & Productivity, and Messaging  which all recordedtriple-digit growth in the pastyear.The QualityTime Android app is free to use, and saves usage data for up to two weeks six months. An in-app purchase option will be coming in futureso users who are willing to shell out some money can save usage data for longer than six months.An iOS version of QualityTimeis also planned  although, given Apples control over its ecosystem  itsclearly not going to be able to take over the lock screen or freeze device usage. So expect some kind of app analytics dashboard that can send you a few custom notifications.
