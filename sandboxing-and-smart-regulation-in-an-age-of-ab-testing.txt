Editors Note:Nick Sinai is a Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy Fellow at Harvard Kennedy Schools Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, a Venture Partner at Insight Venture Partners, and a former U.S. Deputy CTO at the White House.The small drone crash at the White House earlier this week is just the latest in a series of reminders that when it comes to regulating new technology the government is woefully slow.In the White House incident, the quadcopterwas operated by an employee of a U.S. intelligenceagency whohad been drinking and lost control of his friends recreational drone.The incident highlighted the fact that the FAA hasyet to finalize its drone rulesand that this security breach may put pressure on the FAA to accelerate that process. I dont think that is a good idea.Rushing the regulatory process can result in rules that are burdensome or unfriendly to innovation.In our era of robust tech experimentation and testing, perhaps the greatest danger to innovation now is the age-old temptation to draw bright lines quickly and lay down knee-jerk rules before all the data are in.Instead, the FAA could try regulatory sandboxing  where some initial constraints are relaxed, without sacrificing public safety, while the rules are still being made.As an example, suppose the FAA stipulated that for the next few years, companies are free to fly drones, under 200 ft, in the state of Texas, for agricultural applications  as long as they exhibit common sense and due caution. The lessons from a limited use case would then inform the FAAs ongoing rulemaking efforts  likely making the final rules simpler and better.Regulatory agencies are deliberative for a reason. They are tasked with providing clear, enforceable rules that protect the American people while minimizing the burden and cost of those rules. They must get wide-ranging input, draft interim rules, seek additional feedback, and only then finalize a rule.The traditional approach to the process can take years.By contrast, regulatory sandboxing would signal to the innovation community a sense of urgency about the industries of the future. We want robots, drones, Bitcoin, 3D printing, and other emerging industries to be built in the U.S. and exported around the world.If we fail to innovate in the regulatory process, it will be at our own peril. Entrepreneurs and investment dollars are already flowing to countries that are moving faster to welcome drone use. Google istesting delivery drones in Australia, instead of the U.S.Of course, there are a lot of important issues the FAA (and other federal agencies, like the FTC) need to sort through in its final rule-making on drones. Should the rules be the same for a Cessna-sized drone and a toy quadcopter? What happens when a drone causes a plane crash or injures an innocent bystander? What about the privacy implications of making it really easy to remotely spy on someone?Im confident these issues will be solved. Drones have the potential to provide tremendous benefits in search and rescue, law enforcement, movie-making,and dozens of applications we havent yet envisioned.The Obamaadministration has madegood progress on regulatory modernization, focusing on ensuring a strict cost-benefit test, revising or repealing outdated rules, and encouraging simplicity.
Building on that progress,the administration should do three thingsto further modernize the regulatory state:Smart, modern regulation means less cost and burden on regulated entities, as well as more innovation and investment, without sacrificing protections and safeguards. For these reasons, it should have bipartisan support.
