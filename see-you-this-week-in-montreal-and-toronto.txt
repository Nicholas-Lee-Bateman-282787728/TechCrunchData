Here we go! TechCrunch is winging its way to Montreal and Toronto this week for some amazing meetups. We want to see you there so I hope youve purchased your ticket, eh.All the pitch-off companies are picked and the judges are in line to offer pithy commentary. The pitch-offs will follow our tried and true formula. Well pick 6 to 8 startups per city and they will have 60 seconds to pitch. Unless you get an email from me specifically stating you are in the pitch-off then you are not in the pitch-off. Applying is not the same as making it. That said, we want to talk to as many of you as possible so be ready with your pitches as we make the rounds. Its a great opportunity to show off your work, your ecosystem, and your city.See you soon!The meetup starts at 7pm and goes until 10:30pm. Tickets cost $10 and include drinks.Place: Socit des Arts Technologiques (SAT)
