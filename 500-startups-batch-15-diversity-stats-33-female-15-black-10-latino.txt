A new 500 Startups batchmeans new diversity stats. In the startup accelerators 15thbatch, 44% of the founders are international, 33% are female, 15% are black and 10% are Latino, 500 Startups Founding Partner Dave McClure announced today at demo day.500 Startups has generallybeen pretty good around investing in female founders. To date, more than 400 startups in the 500 Startups portfolio have at least one female co-founder, McClure said.At the last 500 Startups demo day, we noted that the accelerator made no mention of people of color when touting its diversity numbers. Batch 14, according to McClure,had 25% female founders and 39% international founders. According to our own count, 25% of the founders on stage were people of color.After McClure made the diversity announcement, I mentioned it on Twitter and McClure promptly apologized for not breaking out those stats. He said that he would aim to include those stats in the future, and thats exactly what he did today.Thanks for keeping your word, McClure. Next time, itd be cool if 500 Startups got even more granular and broke out thestats around black and Latino female-founded companies.
