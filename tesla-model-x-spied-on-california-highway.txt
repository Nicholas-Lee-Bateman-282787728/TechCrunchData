Teslas pure electric SUV is nearing launch and there is apparently at least one cruising around California. The video above shows a slightly camouflaged Model X near Palo Alto. The SUV looks good even with all the design elements covered up.Road testing unreleased vehicles is standard operating procedure for automakers. Likewise, capturing pictures and videos is a fun sport for enthusiasts. Generally more cladding is used the farther the vehicle is from launching. In this case, since the Model X was already announced, Tesla likely just covered up the bits of trim not yet finalized on the production model.The Model X is said to hit dealerships in the second half of 2015 after its launch date was pushed back several times.This isnt the first time the Model X was spied in the wild but the video above should give those who pre-ordered a Model X hope that eventually, one day, hopefully sometime this year, Tesla will actually start shipping the electric SUV.
