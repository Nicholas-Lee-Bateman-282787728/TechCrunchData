This past week I made it my mission to see what was going on in downtown Manhattan. A well-timed email here, a hastily caught trainthere, and I found myself at the headquarters of Priority Cycles  a NYC-based bicycle startup that got its wheels on Kickstarterback in 2014.Raising over $565kfor itsoriginal city bike, called the Classic, resulted in the birth of a niche category: bikes that you could throw around without much need of maintenance, if any. Isnt that what youve always wanted from a bicycle?But my visit to the new headquarters of Priority Cycles wasnt to window shop or to look at the bikes of last year, but to speak toco-founder Dave Weiner, and see the next bike in the lineup. Turns out, its a surf bike: characterized by a relaxed riding stance, curved handlebars and mount accessories to accommodate things youd use at a beach, like a surfboard. Weiner calls it the Priority Coast.While the model seen here is a prototype, the core materials and aesthetics will remain the same, with indigo, black, white and sunset rose colorways available through the CoastsKickstarter page. A single Priority Coast will go for $349, but alas, thats only for the first 100 backers; the final retail price will be $399.With a name like that and a clean aesthetic, the Priority Surf looks  picturesque. Made of aluminum and stainless steel with sealed cartridge bearings, sand and water will have a hard time ruining your fancy new surf bike. Also, note the lack of traditional bike chain: aGates Carbon Grease-free belt drive is used instead, meaning this is a fixie surf bike.Despite never having needed a surf bike,I can entertainthe need of having a rust-proof bike. However, personally I dont take too much liking to relaxed riding  chalk that up to being a young man.So while somemight not see it aestheticallysuited for the urban flora of Manhattan, thatPriority Cycles choice of materials is robust, results in confidence knowing that the Priority Surfcantake a beating near the California surf  ora New York pothole or two.
