Today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2015, our ownRyan Lawlersat down withChris Dixon ofAndreessen Horowitz to dig into the investors strategy and how successful the New York technology scene will prove inthe next few years.According to Dixon, New York, a technology scene that cantbe called up and coming, will create 10$1 billion companies in the next three to five years. Some New York-based firms have already broached the unicorn mark, making the point smaller than it might seem.
