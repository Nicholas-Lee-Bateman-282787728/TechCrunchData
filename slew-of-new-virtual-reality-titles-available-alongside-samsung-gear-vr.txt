As we reported earlier, you can now pre-order your Samsung Gear VR. Its a device thats going to unlock virtual reality for a lot of consumers, even though it requires a Samsung phone to drive it.Along with the announcement of pre-order for a ridiculously low $99, a bunch of games are hitting the scene to support its launch. Lands End by Ustwo Games, Bandit Six: Salvo by Climax Studios and Dead Secret by Robot Invader are now on the Oculus store. The Oculus team promises more soon. While Im not a gamer, these are the kind of light-play games and experiences that helped the Nintendo Wii take off.Check out the new action (which Ill be testing over the next few days and will report back on):Additionally, something Im personally excited about and had heard rumblings on, Oculus has released Oculus Arcade, a new way to experience your favorite old-school games like Pac-Man and Sonic. Yep, youll be standing at a good old arcade machine:Toss in thousands of videos from Twitch, Vimeo and over 70 full-length movies from 20th Century Fox and Lionsgate, and youll have plenty to play around with when you get your Gear VR. I mean, thats the point right? Why bother having this tech if the content to go along with it isnt there.If Oculus Socials beta takes off? Well then we wont be alone in our experiences, and thatll mean big dollars and more attention to the space. And of course, thats where Facebooks expertise will really come into play.
