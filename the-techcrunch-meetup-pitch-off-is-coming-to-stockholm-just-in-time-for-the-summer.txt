So heres whats up.As the name suggest, the TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off is a double feature. Were all getting together to have a drink, meet interesting people, talk about the startup ecosystem and the meaning of life.In addition to this exciting networking part, were hosting a pitch-off. Eight to ten startups will have exactly two minutes to pitch their product to a panel of local VC judges and TechCrunch editors. At the end of the night, well crown the winner of the Stockholm Pitch-Off.But a competition without prizes is no fun, right? The winner will get a booth in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt in London. Second and third places will respectively get two tickets and one ticket for the big show.So why dont you apply for a chance to participate in the pitch-off?
