Services like Pandora, Spotify and whatever Apple is working on tend to get most of the headlines, but iHeartRadio says it has been buildinga big audience of its own  specifically 70 million registered users.The streaming music service was created by radio giant Clear Channel, which rebranded as iHeartMedia last year. iHeartRadio allows users to listen to live radio stations, as well as creating their own custom stations.One point of pride: The fact that it only took less than four years (1,361 days,specifically) to reach the 70 million number, which it says is faster than any other streaming music service. Its only been six months since iHeartRadio announced that hit 60 million users.iHeartRadios General Manager Owen Grover said one of the big sourcesof growth has been eating our own cooking, namely promoting the app on iHeartMedias traditional radio stations. He argued that this illustrates the personal relationship that the company and its on-air personalities have developed with listeners.Its the differentiation of a Google AdWords campaign versushaving a trusted personality as part of your routine, he said.Of course, a registered user count doesnt tell you how many people are actually listening on a regular basis. (Spotify, in contrast, says it has more than 60 million monthly active users and 15 million paying subscribers.)Grover did note that the service is still getting tens and tens of thousands of new registrations on a daily basis.You can read more in this company blog post.
