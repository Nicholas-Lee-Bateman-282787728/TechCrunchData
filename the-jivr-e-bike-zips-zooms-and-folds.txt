The electric bike, like the electric car and, for some, electric underwear, has long been the dream of futurists. Many have tried to make a solid, portable, and foldable bike and many have failed. Perhaps Jivr hasnt?This chainless bike was created by a Polish inventor Marcin Piatkowski. It can go about 20 miles per hour with a 20-mile range and it is light enough to pedal if your battery poops out. It is highly portable  just fold it and go  and it connects to your cellphone via a plug-in cable and Beacon technology.You can get an early bird unit for about $1,200 and they will start shipping in September. Its obviously a bit pricey but most e-bikes are floating in the $1,500 range and this one looks like the old Polish skladak, a bike so beloved/hated by many in the country that it is almost cultic. To be able to own your own super-powered, high-tech folding bike is, for some, a dream come true.The team is looking for 70,000 to start building and theyre pretty close. Ive seen the bike in person, or at least an early prototype, and it looks pretty nice. Id like to give it a spin one of these days and race a Tesla while wearing, obviously, my electric underwear. Excelsior!
