For those of you who havent used it yet, HotelTonight allows users to book same-day hotel rooms from their smartphones, at discounted rates  useful if you end up staying out late at one of the Disrupt parties. Or, if youre not quite comfortable waiting until the very last minute, the company added a seven-day reservation system last fall.HotelTonight was founded in 2010 and has become my go-to hotel booking app, not just because of the available rooms and prices, but also because of its beautiful, easy-to-use mobile interface. And its attracted significant venture backing, raising a $45 million round back in 2013, plus an investment from former Starwood Hotels CEO Barry Sternlicht.Before co-founding HotelTonight, CEO Sam Shank led travel search engine DealBase. Hes also an angel investor whos backed startups including campsite search engine Hipcamp. And as you can see from the photo above, Shank was on-stage at the Crunchies last month, where HotelTonight took home the award for best on-demand service (Im the stressed-out looking Asian guy behind him).Disrupt NY will place from May 4-6 at the Manhattan Center. General admission tickets are currently available at an early bird discount rate. Startups can also register to exhibit in Startup Alley.Our sponsors help make Disrupt happen.
