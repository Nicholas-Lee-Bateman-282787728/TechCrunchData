On Wednesday afternoonthe Federal Communications Commissionfiled its net neutrality order to the Federal Register, an FCC official confirmed to TechCrunch. Once published by the Register, the filing opensthe gates to an inevitableoutpouring of legal challenges fromnet neutrality opponents.The FCCs filing comes a week-and-a-halfafter the agency was slammed with the first lawsuits attempting to block the new rules. An FCC official saidthe lawsuits from both The United States Telecom Association and Alamo Broadband  which were filed just 12 days after the rules were published  jumped the gun and maybe dismissed on the grounds they were filed too early.In the comingdays when the filing is formally published in the Federal Register,the providers will beon solid legal footing to submit such challenges.The rules go into effect 60 days after they are published by the Federal Register.Before the FCC even released its net neutrality order, the agencys chairman Tom Wheeler anticipated an influx of legal challenges to the new rules. He famously said, The big dogs are going to sue regardless of what comes out.But the FCC maintains that the rules were developed with potential challenges in mind, and as recently as last week, Wheeler saidthat the rules will withstand challenges in court.In addition to private suits, the chairman is defending the rules toCongress, where Republicans have alleged the Obama administration exerted influence over the independent agencys rule-making. The chairman recently completed a circuit of congressional hearings, testifying before five committees and subcommittees over the course of two weeks.
