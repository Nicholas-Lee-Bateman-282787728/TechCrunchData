We have come a long way from the first event in a bar in Bermondsey in 2009, but in front of almost 800 of Europes top tech entrepreneurs and investors, The Europas Conference and Awards played host to the cream of Europes tech startup industry. Over 600 participants attended this year for the largely invitation-only daytime conference and around 800 attended the Awards ceremony. All the pictures are here and a short video is below (more is coming).The editorially-curated Conference and Awards for European technology startups announced The Best Tech Startups in Europe, at least according to the combined votes of over 10,000 public votes and a panel of 19 industry judges made up of European journalists, entrepreneurs and investors.TechCrunch was the exclusive media sponsor for The Europas, and all attendees, nominees and winners of the Europas Awards were presented with discounts to TechCrunch Disrupt in London, later this year.Citymapper took home the Best Transport Startup, Best Mobile Startup and the ultimate Grand Prix prize.The annual celebration of Europes brightest and best tech companies, The Europas saw over 50 speakers come together in Central London, just ahead of the industry Awards finale, where over 25 of Europes best startups and founders were honoured by their peers. It even featured a fire-breathing robotic horse.Over the last few weeks, startups have been able to either apply for an award or be nominated by a third party. A judging panel has then selected a shortlist of nominees, which has been submitted to public voting. The results were combined to determine the most forward-thinking and innovative European tech companies across 25 categories.As a first this year, The Europas featured a new award category honouring startups aiding children in the worlds toughest environments, sponsored by UNICEF UK. The winner in that category was Simprints which is building a mobile biometric scanner and open-source software to empower the mobile tools used by researchers, NGOs and governments around the world.Its been an incredible year for European startups, which have continued on their upward curve over the last few years. Weve seen some very significant fund-raisings, some amazing new products and a mounting number of exits, whether through acquisition or IPO.Michiel Kotting, Accel Partners, commented: Its a fantastic time to be an entrepreneur or investor in Europe right now. Were seeing new globally defining businesses being built, with metrics that are unprecedented. The standard of this years entries in the Europas prove this trend.Robin Wauters, Founding editor of Tech.eu also commented: One of the things that characterises the European technology industry is a distinct lack of celebration of its past and current successes, and chronically insufficient recognition for its main role models. As hubs across Europe continue to mature, The Europas does an excellent and important job by giving international recognition to the individuals and companies that dare to innovate, challenge the status quo and consistently lead by example. Europes movers and shakers deserve a spotlight, and The Europas provides them with the best possible stage.Eileen Burbidge, Partner at Passion Capital added: The Europas Awards has been vital ingredient and long-time supporter of the European startup ecosystem. Its fantastic to see so many impressive nominees and shortlisted companies and people this year recognized by The Europas which will go on to deliver huge successes in the region.Dimitri Sarle, Arctic Startup said: This years Europas Awards demonstrates just how much the startup scene has both grown and synergized across Europe. There is a much wider selection of startups from many countries and industries than before. It is really becoming the Oscars for the Tech Industry in Europe.Alex Wood, Editor in Chief, The Memo, said: The Europas is the definitive awards for European startups. This years entries were the best yet and demonstrate the talent Europes tech scene has to offer.Alexandre Barbosa, Managing Partner of Faber Ventures, concluded: The Europas has been a great opportunity to meet high potential founders and dive into informal and interesting discussions with peer investors and partners from all over Europe. I look forward to having a growing number of participants from South Europe and seeing more nominations of early startups from Lisbon, Barcelona and other emerging and vibrant hubs.Those honoured consisted of an amazing group of companies and people.The winners, selected from the nominees, were:# Category Winner 1 Best Entertainment Startup
