Outside of a mobile applications official product, there tends to exist a broader ecosystem catering the wants and unmet desires of its user community. ForInstagram, there are apps toboostyour followers; Tinder users could oncepeer into who likes them and undotheir accidental swipes; and dozens Snapchat apps bloomed, allowing users to automatically save incoming photos or share items pre-recorded items fromtheir phones Camera Roll.But in the latter case, at least, those apps will be no more.While many todayare still available for download in Google and Apples mobile app stores, the company confirmed this week what many users have beenrealizing for months now  these apps will no longer work, and theyll soonbe forced to shut down entirely.Given Snapchats popularity, its not surprising that massive numbersofthird-party applications have beencreated, including apps likeSaveSnap, Snap Sender, UploadSnap, Snap Keeper, SnapBox, Snap Save, UploadnRoll, Snap Up, Save for Snapchat, Snap-Hack, Snap Upload, SnapPad, Snap Up, SnapSend, the infamous Snapsaved, and many more. What is surprising, perhaps, is how long they were allowed to operate.Snapchat never provided developers with official access to its APIs,but as the large number of third-party applications makes clear, reverse engineering access to the APIs was not too difficult. If anything, the company seemed to have been shrugging its shoulders at the existence of its growing third-party ecosystem, instead focusing on the development of its bottom-line impacting initiatives, like the launch of new features including Snapchat Stories, Our Story and Discover, for example.But last fall, Snapchat was finally forced to pay attention to the problem as it realizedthe negative ramificationsthat came from allowing unauthorized apps to thrive. In October 2014, insecurities in a third-party app werefound to be the cause for the large-scale Snapchat hack that was dubbed The Snappening. The hack exposed some 200,000 Snapchat photos from a services whose main draw to date had been its ephemeral, and therefore more private, nature.The Snappening ended up having littleimpact on Snapchats growth or usage, but it certainly gave the company a black eye in the media spotlight, and its impossible to track how many potential new users may have shied away in light of the news.At the time, Snapchat did little in way of apologizing to its users, essentially pointing the finger at the third-parties, instead of acknowledginghow easy it made it for those apps to exist in the first place.Now the company is doing something about it.In an interview this week, Snapchat confirmed what many app users could already tell you: the third-party ecosystem is being shut down.The change is a result of the companys months-long efforts to make its APIs tougher for developers to access  something that users have begun to notice, according to App Store reviews. Especially on paid apps, youll find users posting complaints of error messages and other bugs, and begging for developers to fix the problems. But this time around, those developers may not be able to get their apps working again.Snapchat explained how its initial efforts to block these apps hadaffected users, noting that first the user would bewarned, and then, if they continued to use the app, Snapchat wouldlock theaccount.However, the company says that the warning messages should no longer be necessary as it believes it has fortified its API to the point of being able to lock out these third-party apps for good. Whats more, Snapchat says its also been working with Google and Apple to try to get the apps removed from their respective app stores, citing Terms of Service violations.Today, in fact, there are very few third-party Snapchat apps at all on Google Play, and none which claim to help you save photos or upload images from your photo gallery. Meanwhile, the iTunes App Store is still fairly full of these apps, but most no longerwork weve found, and app store reviews confirm.Some users feel ripped off having once paid for apps that are now broken. Their only recourse, in most cases, isgoing through the cumbersome refund process at the respective app stores. After all, many of the developers dont publish contact information or support addresses on the App Store. They simply rode the wave, took usersmoney, then disappeared.Snapchat is not alone in making a delayed decision with how to approach its third-party developer community. Twitter, for instance, had a long history of retroactively revoking developer access to its various functions over the years, putting app makers out of businessin the process.LinkedIn, too, has beenpulling back more on which developerswill be able to use its API and how. And recently, Facebook-owned WhatsApp has been running its own crackdown on third-party apps, which confused somewho thought they were being banned from WhatsApp itself thanks to unclear reports about the problem.While the decision to shutter the broader app community could leaveusers frustrated, fast-growing Snapchat is likely not too concerned with theircomplaints.You maythink thatkickingusers out from apps they grew to love and then began to think of as part of their default experience would see those peoplehesitant to return the officially sanctioned app going forward. But doesnt seem to be the usual turn of events following these kinds decisions, history has shown.
