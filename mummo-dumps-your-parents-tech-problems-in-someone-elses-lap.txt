How many times has your mom or dad called with an obvious-to-you question about their phone, or printer, or in the case of my mother, the Apple TV?Of course, you want to be a good son or daughter and help, but sometimes its a bad time or its hard to understand the problem without being there with them. Thats where Mummo, a product built at our Disrupt London Hackathon, comes in.Mummo lets anyone, whether they have a smartphone or not, send a text to the service to get tech help. Mummo responds to each text (via the Twilio API) to get a name and a post code for each customer, and then finds a local helper to solve the problem.Helpers can be anyone who registers forthe service, as Mummo isnt meant for hardcore IT issues but rather simple problems like upgrading to a newer version of the OS.We find that older people are worried about clicking and playing around with gadgets, said founder Heidi Khkonen. We allow anyone who has a basic understanding of tech and some free time to register to be a helper on Mummo.The helper can start by initiating a phone call with the customer to try and solve the problem via phone. If it seems that an in-person interaction is necessary, the helper can make a house call.The client then chooses what to pay, with a minimum required payment for all problems that are solved. For phone calls, the client can pay between 1 and 10, while a house call could range from 10 to 30.Obviously, the team will have to look into safety concerns (with strangers visiting peoples homes) as well as the right percentage to take for Mummo per transaction. But given that the product was built in the last 24 hours, its safe to say Mummo is only starting.Mummo connects the ones that can help with the ones that need help #HackDisrupt https://t.co/wlgnavoBex TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) December 6, 2015The team hasnt yet secured a domain, but well be sure to update this post with a link as soon as we get the info.
