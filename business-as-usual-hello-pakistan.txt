Facebooks Internet.org initiative to provide free basic internet access has been heavilycriticizedover the past few months, but its business asusual for the U.S. company after its service rolled into Pakistana country with a population of over 180 million today.Telenor is the local operatorpartner this time around, and the launch makes Pakistan the eleventhtwelfth country where Internet.org is present. Telenors 35 million customers in Pakistanwill gain access to 17 internet service if they opt in to Internet.org, those include the usual mix of weather and news services,as well as Bing andFacebooks own Messenger service.Its hard to mention Internet.org without raising the topic of net neutrality,which has been hotlydebated in Indiasincethe service arrivedthere in February.Facebooks approach to Internet.org effectively creates a limited walled garden of services which customers of partner operators can access for free. That situation hands thosechosen services an unfair advantage over their competitors, not to mention that itmakes Facebook and operators powerful gatekeepers. Concern around thisprompteda number of Internet.org partners in Indiato withdraw fromthe initiative, while alsoincreasing awareness of the issue in other Internet.org markets too.In response, Facebook opened the program up to third-party developers, but a seriesof caveats imposed on developers  including a ban on VoIP services, no support for HTTPS, and the fact that operators can rejectservices outright  provides plenty ofcause for concern. Added to that, many startups are time and resourceconstrained already, without the additional demand of creating apps for yet anotherplatform.Mark Zuckerberg continues to maintain that some access to the Internet is better than nothing at all, particularly when billions of people on the planet remain offline. While that statement is undoubtedly right at face value, Facebooks approach to providing its program is at odds with a fair internet. Critics have argued that offering time-limited access to the entire web would represent a more progressive strategy, but for now Facebook is ploughing ahead with its Internet.org rollout even though its now a platform.
