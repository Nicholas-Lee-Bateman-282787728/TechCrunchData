Standing is better than sitting. Most of the time. Sometimes your body needs a rest and thats where the Humanscale OfficeIQ powered by Tome comes to play.Tomes Jack Sigalstopped by the TechCrunch broadcast booth to show me how this desk can help me lose weight. Software and hardware developed by his new company is built into the Humanscale desk and chair and will send notifications to the user about the optimal work position.Sometimes its better to stand and sometimes its better to sit. The desk will even help the user properly adjust to the best height.Co-founders JakeSigal and Massimo Baldini founded Tome after selling their last startup, Livio, to Ford Motor Company in 2013. Sigal tells me Livio is still going strong and found a great partner in Ford.
