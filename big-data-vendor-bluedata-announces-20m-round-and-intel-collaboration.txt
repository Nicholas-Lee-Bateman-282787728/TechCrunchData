BlueData, a company that helps customers generatevirtualized big data clusters,announced a $20 million Series C round and a partnership with Intel today.Intel Capital led the round. Also participating wereAmplify Partners, Atlantic Bridge, Ignition Partners, as well as a strategic investor who chose to remain anonymous. As part of the deal,Doug Fisher, senior vice president of Intel and general manager of its Software and Services Group, will join BlueDatas board of directors.BlueDatas founders have their roots in VMware. The goal with BlueData has been to make it as easyto spin up a Hadoop cluster as it is avirtual machine, company founder and CEO Kumar Sreekanti told TechCrunch.Enterprises require efficient and agile implementations for their on-premises big data solutions. Speed and innovation are essential in big data analytics, and the infrastructure cant slow this down.Sreekanti wrote in a blog post.The product is essentially Hadoop- or Spark-as-a Service, but instead of living in the cloud, it resides on-premises on customerhardware. It combinesthe agility, speed and multi-tenancy of the cloud with the performance of running onbaremetal in the data center.Whats more, itworks with any version of Hadoop or Apache Spark. The company isalsoplanning on supporting Docker containers in an upcoming release.The deal with Intel will involve several levels including engineers from both companiesworking together. BlueData will also haveearly access to new hardware releases. The idea is that BlueData will work to optimize its products on Intel architecture, particularly Intel Xeon chips.The two companieswill also work together on jointmarketing and sales projects, and Intel will provideBlueData with the entree at the large enterprise customers it craves.The partnership has the potential to be a huge boost to a small company like BlueData, which currently has 35 employees. The agreement is part of Intels ongoing effort to support big data companies, and comes on the heels of a similar dealwith Cloudera, a BlueData partner, last year.This isnt the first time, Intel has shown interest in BlueData. It also contributed to the companysSeries A and B round.Intel has been spreading the wealth this week. Justyesterday,it announced a big cloud pushto go with its big data initiative. As part of that, it invested significant money and resourcesinMirantis , an OpenStack company.Since it launched in 2012 BlueDatahas raised a fairly modest $39 million across three rounds including todays announcement  and it wasnt looking for a big score this time.We werent looking for a huge amount of money. Its too early for that,Sreekanti said.Sreekanti wouldnt say exactly how many customers it has, but it lists several on the companywebsite including Comcast, Orange and Symantec.
