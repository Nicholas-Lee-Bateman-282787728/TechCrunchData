You wait ages for the next gen of pro-privacy smartphones to come along and then a couple of contenders start making noiseat onceToday, Silent Circles Blackphone 2 has gone on sale  with an RRP of $799 (excluding taxes).The company started taking pre-orders for the devicelast month, having first announced the phoneback in March at the Mobile World Congress trade show.Meanwhile, on Friday, BlackBerry CEO John Chen finally confirmed the various leaks pointing to a forthcoming Android-powered BlackBerry, due to go on sale by the end of this year in major markets. The BlackBerry Priv  as its called  runs Google, as Chen put it, while demoing the Qwerty slider to BNN. Theres no word on the Privs price tagat this point.Silent Circles Blackphone targets the enterprise segment where BlackBerry used to dominate, before it fell behind the Android and iOS curve. Blackphone 2 runs the companys security-hardened flavorof Android, now calledSilent OS. And although this is an Android fork itnow includes Google services  such as thePlay Store as well assupport for Googles Android ForWork program, to check theIT departments mobile device management box.Silent Circle says the handset is thefirst component of its cloud-based Enterprise Privacy Platform  which comprises a suite of services, softwareand devices all aimed at appealing to enterprise users by baking in privacy. Its also certified with existing MDM systems, including MobileIron, Citrix, Good and SOTI.And while,on the surface, the phones OS nowlooks more like A N Other standard Android handset, a spokesman for Silent Circle assertsthat under the hood key security-focused differences remain. Theyve worked closer with Google than they did before, which is why youll see that the Android platform is a much truer version. But SilentOS is built deep into the phone so everything that sits on it is very much an enhanced version of Android, he says.The Blackphone hardware offers a vehicle for Silent Circles existing encrypted comms apps, such as Silent Phone  which are also available on other companys hardware but the handsetalso includes additional features such as Security Center, where users can granularly tweak app permissions, and a sandboxing feature called Spaces that offers separate secure environments to put barriersbetweenpersonal andbusiness data.The original Blackphone included subscriptions to a variety of pro-privacy third party services. But SilentOS now bakes in more features so, while theres a one-year subscription to Silent Circles services included in the price-tag, theres no longer the range ofthird party subscription services that were included with the debut handset.What has been developed a lot more is actually what is available on the phone itself, saysthespokesman, discussing the shift away from bundling in third party subscription services.Before you didnt have access to things like Spaces, the Security Center, these aspects of the phone have been directly built into the new phone, which didnt exist before.The wi-fi manager is more than simply managing connections  it provides you with an extra layer of security where if youre in an area where theres an insecure network it helps prevent making a connection, unless you specify youre comfortable with allowing it to happen, which you wouldnt get with any other traditional wi-fi systems.Andwhereas the original Blackphone bundled a subscription tosecure cloud storage and file transfer service SpiderOak, the spokesmannotes that secure filetransfers can now be done via the Silent Phone application  which allows for files of up to 1GB to be transferred via itsencrypted network.As well as Google Play on board Blackphone 2, theres also a Blackphoneapp store which aims to offer a curated selection of apps security reviewed by Silent Circle staff. As yet there arentmany apps in this store but the spokesman saysthe aim is to start fleshing that out now.Theyre going to begin filling that over the next few months, he notes. Theres also going to be applications available on Google Play that get put through a rigorous series of tests by the security team and engineering team within Silent Circle.And then youre going to almost have applications that sit in that store which although theyre linked directly through to Google Play, [youll have] the peace of mind and knowledge that theyve gone through a thorough testing process. And any applications that would sit in that store are ones which are highly secure, unlikely to be leaking any of your data.Specs wise, theBlackphone 2 beefs up the original handsets hardware with a larger, 5.5inch screen,anOcta-core Qualcommprocessor, 3GB RAM, 32GB of internal storage plus a Micro SD cardslot for user expandable storage,and a 13-megapixel camera.
