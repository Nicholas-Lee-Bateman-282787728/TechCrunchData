Our Disrupt London hackathon is officially underway. More than 1,000 people have registered to compete  by this time tomorrow, theyll formteams, buildnew products and present them on-stage.Katie Roof and I took the opportunity to interview a few of them, finding a mix of neophytes and veterans  even a romantic couple who first met at a hackathon. We cant promise similarly sweet stories from the rest of the event, but hey, you can always hope Tickets to Disrupt London are still available and can be purchased here.
