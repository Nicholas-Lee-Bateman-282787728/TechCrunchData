Editors note:Patricia Nakacheis a partner atTrinity Ventures. Shehas active investments in companies including mcommerce players Care.com, EAT Club, and ThredUP.Phil Carteris an associate atTrinity Ventures, where he focuses on mobile-enabled marketplaces and services and has supported recent investments in RelayRides and ZIRX.Last year represented a tipping point inmobilecommerceinvestment, so as we begina new year,we wanted to take stock by updating our m-commerce market map and offering ourpredictionsfor2015.Arecent report by Digi-Capital estimates that VCs invested$4.2 billion in m-commerce from Q3 2013 to Q3 2014, far surpassing the$1.2 billion invested in 2013 and the $829 million invested in the previous two years combined. While much of this capital was poured into a few multibillion dollar juggernauts likeUberandPinterest, it has also continued to fuel an explosion of m-commerce startups, including several in new subcategories.In marketplaces, startups likeEatWithandFeastlyare betting they can replicate the success of P2P models likeAirbnbandRelayRidesto disrupt the $600 billion U.S. restaurant industry with in-home dining experiences. Meanwhile, On-Demand Services are emerging in several new subcategories, particularly in dense urban areas with high-frequency use cases. ZIRXandLuxemake commercial parking easier with on-demand valet services that let drivers drop cars off wherever they want, with optional add-on services like gas refills and car washes included.And B2B models likeKeychain Logistics,Cargomatic, andDelivare revolutionizing logistics at every part of the supply chain. Finally, in app-based services, theres been a proliferation of new businesses focused onmobilehealth and wellness fromRiseandKurbo Healthin nutrition toLantern,Talkspace, and7 Cups of Teain mental health, among many others.These startups are leveraging smartphones to intercept users in the course of their daily routines and help them to lead healthier, happier lives. We also added education and productivity, two established app-based service categories that did not appear in the first version of the market map.Given thatmobiledevices only account for1 percent of the $3.25T U.S. retail spending market, m-commerce is clearly still in its infancy, and we expect continued rapid growth in2015.If there was one m-commerce theme that summed up 2014, it was the explosion in on-demand services. In the last 12 months, many articles have been written about the Uberification of our economy, withSteve Schlafmans deckpublished in April providing a helpful summary.This trend has been led by Uber itself, whose value skyrocketed from a few billion dollars at the beginning of 2014 to$17 billion in Juneand$41 billion in its most recent $1.2 billion round. Yet there have been plenty of on-demand services that have failed to replicate Ubers success, including many of Ubers competitors in the ridesharing space thathave struggled to demonstrate either exponential growth or positive contribution margins.At issue for some on-demand services is not only intense competition in certain subcategories, but that their value proposition is not dramatically better than that of incumbents.For example, in the home cleaning and laundry service categories, the benefits provided by amobileapplication are less dramatic relative to ridesharing because these services are typically not delivered on a truly on-demand basis.In subcategories where the market size is too small, the capital required to scale is too large, or the improvement relative to incumbent models is too marginal,we expect there to be a significant shakeout in2015as VC investment in on-demand services slows down and startups with no discernable path to profitability sell or go out of business.The web is an increasingly visual experience, and its no secret that companies have capitalized on this trend by using photo rich content to attract large user bases. Pinterest is perhaps the poster child of this movement, having amassed60-70 million usersthat are now being monetized through the use of promoted pins. Similarly, e-commerce companies such asZulilyhave learned that high-quality photos consistently boost conversion rates.Onmobile, photos are even more important given small screen sizes, and contextual commercecompanies large and small are increasingly using photos not just to acquire users but to monetize them.According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted last year,18 percent of smartphone users were using Instagram and 9 percent were using Snapchat as of October 2013. And just as Pinterest did on the web, these apps are creating new forms of visual advertising to capitalize on their user traffic.Instagram launched video adsin October, letting brands directly target users in their feeds rather than relying on traffic to their corporate accounts, and expectations are that the service will introduce commercial transaction capabilities. Similarly,Snapchat released its first snapvertisements,which are interspersed in a users story feed and disappear forever after a single viewing just like ordinary messages.We expect the trend toward visualcommerceto expand asFacebook and Twitter build infrastructure to support transactionsand other m-commerce startups increasingly rely on photos and videos to attract and monetize users.In the same way that offlinecommercehas seen the rise of specialty retail, the App-Based Services category is also experiencing a proliferation of startups targeting niche markets, with the potential to expand into larger platforms.Given the constraints imposed bymobile, it has become increasingly clear that App-Based Service startups are better off doing a great job meeting one need rather than trying to do a good job meeting many needs. We see this pattern inmobilehealth, whereGlowandOvulinehave amassed highly engaged female user bases with initial products focused entirely on personalized fertility tracking and pregnancy support, and in personal finance, where apps likeActiveHoursandMileIQhave achieved impressive app store rankings despite targeting narrow initial use cases in payday loans and business mileage tax deductions, respectively.Going into2015,we expect the trend toward specialization to expand into many other app-based service subcategories.Annual m-commerce investment activity has risen more than 10x over the last few years. Every quarter, entirely new subcategories ofmobile-enabled services are emerging, and we expect the momentum to continue in2015as VCs invest behind trends such as visualcommerceand specialized app-based services. At the same time, in crowded categories like on-demand services, wepredictthat competition and heavy capital requirements will force consolidation over time, with players that have established positive contribution margins and favorable customer acquisition economics emerging as winners.
