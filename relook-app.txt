Generation selfie might be flirting with livestreaming apps butthat doesnt mean its abandoned its primarylove affair with lensing and filtering shots of its own face. God no. How else would it continue injectingthe required expressiveness acrossitssocial feeds?And sopublic places remain awash with phone-holding folk all duckfacing and selfie-sticking  as they attempt to procure le visage juste du jour.Just imagine how much more gurning into a lens is going on in private.Really this issweating toil for very fleeting fancy. Especially when the end result ismutablepixels. Truly the digitalselfie is an entirelymoveable feast. Just add that hipster filter, or run it through that slimming algorithm, and so on.For those wanting to get evenmore pro about how they polish their selfies, a newly launched iOS app called Relook(priced at a hefty $3.99  but hey, what price vanity?) offers an extensive range of mobile-friendly facialcorrecting tools  from skin smoothing to blemish correction to teeth whitening  all designed to work with inexpert finger swipes on a touchscreen, rather thanrequiring specialist image editing software knowledge. (So again, this is mobile as the driverfor overhauling overly complex user interface design.)Although it can be used purely on mobile, the app also supportsfileexports toPhotoshop (with full layer data)  so is aiming to appeal to image editing pros too, as well as anyone who wants their selfie to look a bit less photorealistic.Its extremely easy to use  and the results appearmore than passable for the disposable currency of the socially shared selfie (although proper Photoshop pros may not be so impressed when they dig into the detail).In the same way that Snapseed made high end image post-processingaccessible to anyone with a smartphone,via easy-to-usemobile tools, Relook is aiming to repeat thetrick fully focused onselfie editing. And we know how enormous thatmarket is.Call it thedemocratizing of looking unrealistically good.Remember kids: the camera never lies; itsjust a matterof howyoumanipulatelight and shade.Aka:truthon the Internetis (increasingly) relative.
