Welcome to another Friday and another episodeof CrunchWeek. This week we had a treat in that two-thirds of our staffs Sarahs sat down to dig in and rake over the news.We presume that you are bleary eyed due to staying up all night trying to fend off both nerds and tech press redundant though the juxtaposition may be   to order an Apple watch. Also popping this week was Zyngas share price, in the negative direction, and HBO Now has finally come out to the joy of Millennials and Game of Thrones fans. But again, same difference.So pour something stiff, sit on something soft, and sip along with us as we repine our way into the weekend.
