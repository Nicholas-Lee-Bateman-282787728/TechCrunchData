Rick Devine has spent more than a decade as an executive recruiter, and even introduced Steve Jobs tohis eventual successor Tim Cook back in 1998.Now hes working on a startup called TalentSky, aimingto addresssome of thebig problems he sees in the hiring landscape  specifically,the skills gap,where employers cant find job applicants with the skillsthey need.For Devine, the issue is that the change in the complexity of work, or the evolution of work, is accelerating at a faster rate than the ongoing development of workers.TalentSky is supposed to make it easier for individuals to showcase the skills they already have. Those skills are verified by ratings from colleagues, and not just the random Yeah, this person knows about journalism! recommendations you might find elsewhere. (Uh, no offense to the people who give me positive ratings on LinkedIn.)On TalentSky, you rate someones skills on a scale from basic to expert. The individual ratings are anonymous, but to rate someone you have to be connected through at least one of their work moments. The ratings are also weighted, so presumably a colleague or boss whos worked closely with you for years will have a bigger effect on your overall scores than someone who collaborated with you once.In addition to highlighting the skills you already have, TalentSky could also help you identify the skills you need to get the jobs you want. Devines plans on that front arent limited to individual job applicants, but to broader trends in recruiting.You have to get the industry to speak as one with regard to skills, he said.In other words, he wants to bring together leading companies in each industry to identify the kinds of skills that theyre looking for. To that end, TalentSky has also worked with IBMs Smarter Workforce initiative to create what it calls a universal employer-to-professional skills language, so that theres less ambiguity when an employer or job applicant is talking about a specific skill.
