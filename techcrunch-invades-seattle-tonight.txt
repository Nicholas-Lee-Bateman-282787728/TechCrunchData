Dear city of Seattle,This is a love letter. Because I love you. Wow. Seattle, you're more gorgeous then I remember. Jordan Crook (@jordanrcrook) June 25, 2015Which is why I have come to this beautiful town, bringing with me TechCrunch writers Greg Kumparak and Frederic Lardinois, and a full-fledged Pitch-Off. Well be hitting Showbox SoDo at 6pm tonight, where ten companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product to a live audience and a panel of local VC judges. Its going to be a night to remember, and now is truly your last chance to be a part of it. Tickets are $10, and the only rule is that youre legally able to drink (which means 21+ only). Sound cool? Buy a ticket to the Seattle Meetup + Pitch-off right here. Looking forward to seeing you!With love,
Jordan
