The Sand Hill Road venture firm Andreessen Horowitz is in the thick of fundraising and talking with investors about a fresh $1.5 billion fund, according to several sources who note the fund could always close at a higher number.It was almost exactly two years ago that the firm closed its forth, multi-stage venture capital fund, Andreessen Horowitz Fund IV, with $1.5 billion.The money also comes on the heels of a $200 million fund that the firm announced in November called the AH Bio Fund, a vehicle thats being used to invest in mostly early-stage startups at the intersection of computer science and life sciences.Altogether, Andreessen Horowitz, which launched in June 2009, has so far raised $4.35 billion, including three previous funds.The firm declined to comment forthis story, but its easy to imagine that even Andreessen Horowitz  considered one of the top venture firms in the world  isnt finding fundraising quite as easy as it has in the past given uncertainty in the broader market.Though it will undoubtedly reach its target, the young firm is looking for capital at a time when itsown investors may not be feeling terriblyflush.As Chris Douvos, a limited partner with Venture Investment Associates,recently told us, LPs are definitely yelling at VCs to put some moolah in the coolah. Institutional funds give out money [to VCs] expecting it will come back with profits in a reasonable amount of time, said Douvos. When it doesnt, we cant put more money into the asset class because a.) were at the top of our allocation [to venture capital and b.) were out of money.Indeed, thefirmlooks to have spent recent months preparing to woo investors, including by liquidating part of its stake in the car-sharing company Lyft in December.As the WSJ reported earlier this month, both Andreessen Horowitz and early Lyft backer Founders Fund sold some of their shares to Saudi Arabias Prince al-Waleed bin Talal and his Kingdom Holding Co. (Taking money off the table and making distributions to LPs is adecision their fellow investor Fred Wilson recently arguedmore venture firms should bedoing more frequently.)Andreessen Horowitzhas also been shifting its staff around quite a bit. It marked its big move into biotech not just with that $200 million fund but by bringing aboard longtime Stanford professorVijay Pandeas a new general partner.The company also hired TrialPay cofounder Alex Rampell last summer as a general partner. And last week, it brought aboard aninth general partner inMartin Casado, the cofounder and CTO of Nicira, a software defined networking company.(Nicira was anearly bet for Andreessen Horowitz and ranks among its biggest exits to date.)Meanwhile,general partnerand IronPort Systems cofounderScott Weiss announcedlast month that he will no longer be investing in new companies on behalf of Andreessen Horowitz. (Weiss said he wanted to spend more time with his family.)Despite its maneuverings, Andreessen Horowitz could be caught a bit flat-footed by a market turned rocky. Though ithasseen many of its investments marked up wildly over time, much ofthat appreciation remainson paper, as at other firms.Andreessen Horowitz led a $25 million round late 2013 round in the bitcoin exchange Coinbase, for example. The companys valuation wasnt revealed at the time, but in January of 2015, DFJ led a $75 million growth round in the company, presumably providing a nice mark-up for Andreessen Horowitz in the process. (The company, which isnt quite four years old, remains privately held.)In 2012, Andreessen Horowitz also led a $100 million Series A round in Github, the now-eight-year-old, San Francisco-based online repository for software code. The deal was done at a reported $750 million valuation.Last summer,still-private Githubraised $250 million led by Sequoia Capital at a reported $2 billion valuation.Like its peers,Andreessen Horowitz has also made some bets on companies whose trajectory once moved in a straight upward line and have since encountered slowing growth and, in one case, even bigger problems.The firm led two rounds in the location-based tech company Foursquare, for example, leading Foursquares$20 million Series B and its $50 million Series C round at a valuation of roughly $640 million. But Foursquare, which announced another $45 million in funding last month, saw its valuation halved in the deal.Andreessen Horowitz also led two separate rounds of funding for the human resources software company Zenefits in 2014. TechCrunch reported at the time that the company had a pre-money valuation of $500 million, which suggestsAndreessen Horowitzmay still do well by the company.That betlooks less certain than it once did, however.Though Zenefits went on to obtain a $4.5 billion valuation,things have famously gone very wrongsince. (New CEO David Sacks is busily trying to restore confidence in the company, including resorting to an admittedly funny jokeon Twitter yesterdayabout Zenefits formerly freewheeling culture.)Even a turnaround at Zenefits wont be enough for one top LP, who told us privately this week that Andreessen Horowitz is the poster child for valuation insensitivity, and called the firms move into healthcare a real sign of desperation.Of course, the high-profile firm has always had its share of detractors as well as adherents. Wed hazard a guess that plenty of otherinvestorsare clambering to get into the firms newest fund before the door shuts.Said another LP who talked with us about the firm and some of its recent transitions: They have such a large organization that it necessarily has to be a little hierarchical in terms of how much deal process you lead and how much autonomy you can enjoy.Andreessen will probably always have some [staffing] changes, because there are a lot oftalented people there who have a lot of options.Additional reporting by Matthew Lynley.
