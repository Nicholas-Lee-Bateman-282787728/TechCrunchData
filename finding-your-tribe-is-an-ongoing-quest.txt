Editors note: Robert Siegel is a seed-stage VC at XSeedCapitaland a lecturer at Stanford Business School.I am watching my oldest child explore where she willwantto attend university when she completes her final year of high school. This past monthmy wife and daughter drove through sixdifferent states and looked at over a dozen universities and colleges, with the hope that my 17 year-old childwill find a place where she fits in and will feel excited aboutthe next phase of her life journey.At thissame time, as is the case every spring, I am having numerous conversations with many of my students at Stanford about what their first job will be when they complete their graduate studiesin the nextmonth. The issues they wrestle with include not only finding a company that has a chance for growth and commercial success, but also one where they will enjoy the people with whom they work and look forward togoing into the officeevery day.And for those of my students who are contemplatingstarting a company, many of the entrepreneurs are spending a great deal of time thinking aboutthe type of people they will want to hire and the culture they will want to designinto their new entity.In eachof these situations, I have found that peopleare searching for more than simply their next job, firm or life experience, but at some levelthey are alsoon a quest to findfor theirtribes.Webster defines a tribe as: 1) a group of people that includes many families and relatives who have the same language, customs, and beliefs;2) a large family;3) a group of people who have the same job or interest.In my class at Stanford on theFormation of New Ventureswe teach a series of cases that follow the arc of the entrepreneurial journey  from coming up with anidea, to raising capital, to failing, and even to getting acquired. What issurprising is that when guests come to class and talk to the students about their work stories, they share extensivelyabout not only the challenges of achieving commercial success (or not), but also more personally, the ups and downs of their experiences and the relationships they cemented or destroyed along the way.When I think of the technology startups that my venture firm, XSeed Capital, funds and I watch the roller-coaster rides of the teams as theygo through both good times and bad, I am reminded that one of their desires is to build atribe of individuals who share a set of common goals and cultural norms while striving to build a new product, service or technology thatno one else has. Each set of entrepreneurshas a goal to be effective in constructinga team that can work well together  throughthe ups and downs of the product developmentand startupcycles.In the technology industry, where it is axiomatic that the most valuable asset of a company is its people, building a strong tribe can have tremendous advantages. Not only can it increase loyalty and reduce turnover  helping with the retention of institutional knowledge and providecost savings on recruiting  but it can also make teams more effective at solving problems.When teams have a common language, a known set of operational practices andmethodologies, and when they operate under a set of agreed-upon values and rules, they can be extremely effective in solving difficult problems.However, there can also bea downside to tribalism. The notion of tribal conflict arises when cultures become insular and disconnected from their broader ecosystem. Companiescan lose sight of a changing environmentand miss transitions to new technology architectures, new ways of doing business, and new requirements of customers.Companies such as Intel, Microsoft and HP, all of whom had strong cultures that were celebrated in their day, lost their way in thetransition to a mobile and cloud-based world, and their existing ways of thinking, communicating and looking at the world surely contributed to these very smart people missing tectonic shifts in their industries.I would also posit thatthe challenges the tech communityhas faced inseveral neighborhoods in places such as San Francisco can partly be attributed to several tribes losing perspective on other tribes with whom they bump up against outside of normal work settings (perhaps best exemplified by the conflict captured onvideo between several Dropbox employees and a group of local youth).Thedesire oftechnology companies to build distinct and powerfultribes is one of the most consistent and foundational aspects of Silicon Valley.This very powerful instrumentcan be an importantsource of coherence that helps teams work through the challenges of inventingsomething new, since the journeys of startups and the creationof new technologies tend to be delicate and most often lead to failure.However, the trick for a leader of a technology company is to figure out how to garner the benefits of building ones tribe without having this coherence lead to an inability to recognize and adapt to a constantly changing world.
