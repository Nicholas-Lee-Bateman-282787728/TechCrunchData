Flow, a third-party Instagram app that landed on the iPadnearly twoyears ago, has now made its way to the iPhone.If youre someone who enjoys unofficialapps  such asTweetbot for Twitter  orwant to spruce up the way you use Instagram on mobile, then you might be interested in this app. Important caveat though: third-party Instagram clients cant be used to post photos (at this point, at least) so Flow is strictly about looking and liking.But rather than being a flaw,that premise underpins the app. While the option to post photos would be great, Flow is able to focus exclusively on giving you an easier and more enjoyable way to flick through pics.Oh, and there are no ads  which Instagram just made global  either.The app is an iPhone-optimized version of the iPad incarnation, so if you have that already then youll be familiar. But those who dont will find a very different experience to the native Instagram app that they are accustomed to.So much of the app feels better than Instagram, the layout, interface, design and more.For one thing, Flow uses preview thumbnails to let you easily swipe through a vast array of photos. (The home screen will slowly cycle through photos by itself, a feature I found  and liked  by accident when I left my phone on a table next to me.)Allof your standard Instagram features are here  you can look up all the photos youve liked, click through to profiles, search, find trending images, etc  but theres also a bookmarking option. Given that most people dish out likes for a lot of photos, bookmarks can help keep track of specific images  perhaps ideas for food, new clothes you want to buy or more.The original Flow was particularly appealing because it was optimized Instagram for the iPad  something that the Facebook-owned company still hasnt done  but its a little trickier on the iPhone, where Instagram is already resident and there is limited screen space.Personally, Im not too addicted to Instagram  but even I was able to appreciate the ease in which you can discover and find content inside Flow. Ill be sticking to the native Instagram app for most of my time, but if youre a serious grammer, then you shouldgive it a look.Mark McDermott, co-founder of Codegent  the app development studio behind Flow  said therearent currently plans to release flow for Android, even though it has been heavily requested.As for Instagram,McDermott is hopeful that the feedback will be positive.Weve not spoken much to Instagram since our initial [iPad] launch when they white listed us on the API. They were complimentary of our efforts and we will show them this new version to see what they think, he told TechCrunch.You can download Flow for iOS here.
