Foodpanda, the food delivery on-demand service backed by Germanys Rocket Internet, has ventured into the world of corporations after it introduced a dedicated service for business customers that it hopes will massively increase its income.The companys service is present in 38 countries, primarily emerging markets  thanks to a major spree of acquisitionsover the pastyear  but its corporate offering has initially launched in just sixcountries in Asia:India, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.The idea behind this new offering  which is housed in a separate app and web-based client  is simple. Foodpandaco-founder and CEORalf Wenzel told TechCrunch that around a quarter of itsorders come from corporate addresses but, with many companies subsidizing employee food or providing allowances, Foodpanda smells an opportunity to hone in on that lucrative market.Wenzel predicted that, over time, orders to corporate customers could represent more than 50 percentof income. Given that Foodpanda continues to lose money, though revenue is increasing, the business segment willbe a very crucial one for its future.How it works is quite simple. Corporate customers gain access to the dedicated business service, through which their employees can order food.Wenzel said the selection of restaurants may be different  Foodpanda only selects those that meet a higher standard, e.g. quicker delivery time, for corporates  while each corporate client can select variables, such as budget per employee.The idea is that this simplifies the experience, meaning no need to file invoices, approve expenses, etc.For Foodpanda, corporate clients act much like a subscription, as Wenzel put in, in so much as they are a guaranteed recurring revenue stream  to a point.Foodpanda isnt revealing the identity of its corporate customersyet,but it said that they include multinationals, corporates and insurance companies across the Asia region.The company plans to expand the business service into more markets over time, the addition of more regional, corporate clients could expedite that expansion process.Foodpanda, which has raised $310 million to date  includinga $100 million investment led by Goldman Sachsearlier this year has come under fire in some parts of the world for inconsistent service and, in India, a poorworking culture and manyfake listings on its platform.In response to those challenges, Wenzel admitted that the company had changed how it manages its business over the past few months.We have amore sophisticated and drastic selection [process and we more] carefully manage our inventory, he explained. Werebuilding out our own last mile capabilities [so we can]control the end-to-end experience, we make sure we work with the right restaurants and are taking more responsibility on the last mile delivery.Problems, such as those in India, have necessitated a change in how Foodpanda views itself, Wenzel claimed:We started out being more of a marketplace to connect restaurants to consumers, but, especially in food and certain markets, you need to take much stronger control. We iterated a lot to ensure quality control and weve taken ahigher responsibility of the end-to-end experience.Thats important because, for example, if Iorder food through a platform and the restaurant takes two hours to delivery it, Imight not go back to the service even if though [the platform itself] doesnt have anything to do with the quality of the food orthe delivery service. Its no longer enough to be a simple website or app.With that in mind,Wenzel said that we can expect more changes and iterations to the Foodpanda service, which often competes without major rivals in emerging markets, in part due to Foodpandas global acquisition spree. While he wasnt overly specific in his plans, Wenzels candor is fairy refreshing and unlike the often dour and dryresponses from the CEOs of some Rocket Internet-backed companies.Thefood tech space needs to keep innovating,Wenzel told me. EvenFoodpanda lacks innovationwe want to invest in technology that is new and disruptive.Nonetheless, its impossible to ignore that users in many of Foodpandas markets, thoughactive on the service, are far from delighted at the general quality of its service. While management appear to be aware of the need to improve, Ive met and spoken to plenty of entrepreneurs who believe that they can do food delivery better than Foodpanda.
