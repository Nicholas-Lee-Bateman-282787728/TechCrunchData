You dont even have to pay for shipping.In case you arent sure of what this thing is or does, Google Cardboard lets you drop your iPhone or Android phone into it and lets you view 360 degree videos and photos quite nicely. While its not true VR like what we see with Gear VR or eventually the Rift and Vive, youll enjoy the immersive experience you have.You can only order one, but if you get your friends or family to grab one, you can assemble the entire set of four which includes BB-8, First Order Stormtrooper, Kylo Ren, and R2-D2.These are the droids you're looking for. @starwars Cardboard now available on @GoogleStore. https://t.co/skZOr0ZTyD pic.twitter.com/OKJqGWAAdX Google Cardboard (@googlecardboard) December 11, 2015Of course, once you check out, youre reminded of all of the fun Star Wars things you can do with it:That little infomercial is all you have to pay to get your Cardboard, so rock on and hurry up before they run out.
