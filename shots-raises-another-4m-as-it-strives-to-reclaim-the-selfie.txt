Selfies might bethe social currency of our generation, butthecompanies based around them still kind of need cash.Shots, aselfie app made famous by high-profile celebrity supporters like Justin Bieber, just raisedanother $4 million in funding led by DCM Ventures, adding on to its $8.5 million Series A from this past April. The company has raised $15.2 million to date.Shahidi posting up with the BiebzFor how simple the appis to use, Shots is definitely one of the more intriguingsocial media apps out there.On one hand, Shots is founded on the premise of uploading selfies, a phenomenon often associated by olds with our generations rampant narcissism. But Shots is also differentiatingitself as the app that reclaims the selfie as a means of self-expression rather than a sort of corporate self-branding.Shots takes pride in the fact that its about the photos and videos more than it is about the reactions to them. You can follow friends or celebs like Bieber, but during actual usage of the app youre not stuck with like envy as the appdoesnt allow you to see other users follower or like counts.Shots was founded in 2013 by John Shahidi and his brother Sam, largely with the mission of creating an anti-bullying social network. One of thefirst features to get ditched in this process of creating a safer space was commenting.Per a Medium post from John:Your social status doesnt matter inside Shots. Its about expressing your feelings in a picture, which is why we dont allow comments. We never want our users hurt, harmed or bullied by what they read about themselves on social mediaits about signaling what youre feeling inside.Ive read a lot of these idealistic change-the-world descriptions regarding apps, and my bullshit-o-meter was pretty hyped here, but after actually chatting with Shahidi,its clearthat hestands by this mission.The entire app hones inon thiskind of positivity that isin some way made more genuine by the high profile figures that use the app.Shots tries to play with less of amy life is dope and I do dope shit philosophy towards social media.When you look at [celebrities] Shots feeds, what youll notice is that theyre using that app personally, Shahidi told me. Since you cant upload from the camera roll or use special effects, you really feel like youre getting a very personal look at their lives.Shots community has grown to holdonto a rather interesting corner of the Internet,largely due to the following that Bieber has amassed.Judging by interactions on Shots Twitter account, a large quantityof the apps users seem to beBeliebers looking to get closer insight into the life of the celebrity they adore.Indeed, most of the people active on Shots really are teenage girls. Shahidi told me that over 75% of Shots users are female and the average age of a user is only 16.That makes for a kind of weird philosophical dynamic on the app. With teenage usersflocking to obsess and elevate celebrity icons in their most humanmoments, the appoftencant avoid feedingthe celebrity obsession beast that contradicts its mission. Still, the grittier, less-manicured presentations of celebrity that Shots puts forthare probably healthierfor onlookers than the Im for sale culture that apps like Instagram perpetuate.For all of the philosophy that Shots sells, when you strip away the Instagram-style main feed, youre left with an app that operates very similarly to theStories feature within Snapchat, a companythat is markedlyless idealistic but still does away with public follower counts and commenting, key selling pointsof Shots.What Snapchat lacks though, is a central community that builds off of thatculture.Shots users are continuing togrow moreengaged insidetheir community, though its user base is perhapssmaller than one would expect from an app with such high-profilesupporters.Shots last released user numbers this past Aprilwhentheyclocked their engagement at 5 million users with around halfofusers checking the app on a daily basis.Shahidi acknowledges that Shots core philosophies mighthave limited its short-term growth in some waysthat apps like Instagram havent had to deal with, but he also believes that Shots key to success is in creating an experience for its community that just cant be found elsewhere.When you think about it, social networks are about digital friendships and the best friendships are the ones that really take time to build, Shahidi said.
