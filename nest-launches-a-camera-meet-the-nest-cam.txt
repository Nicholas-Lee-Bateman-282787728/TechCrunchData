Remember when Nest bought Dropcam? That first fruits of that purchase are finally dropping today: Nest has just announced the Nest Cam, an oh-so-Dropcam like security solution.At first glance, the Nest Cam looks like the Dropcam that we all already know. At second glance it still looks like a Dropcam. Its a bit more slim and its curves are a bit curvier  but the base idea is the same: an ultra simple, plug-and-play WiFi security camera.But whats inside?Heres what we know so far:The Nest Cam will ship next week, and cost $199.
