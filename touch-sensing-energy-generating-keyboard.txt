Passwords continue to be a glaring weaknessin digital security. And while biometric alternatives, such as fingerprint readers, are finding their way onto more consumer electronics devices,they are not without their limitationseither.So what about tightening the security screw furtherby applyinga continuous biometric  such as akeyboard that knows whos typing on it in real-time and couldlock out an intruder based on sensing unfamiliar keystrokes?A team of scientists including from the Georgia Institute of Tech and research labs in China have developed just such a prototype device.As well as sensing touch and typing style, the non-mechanical keyboard is able to generate energy to power itself, and self cleans, thanks to a dirt repellent coating and crafty composition thin layers of plastic, topped and tailed withconductive film  so theres no mechanical gullies toharvest the crumbs of your lunch.The low profile keys havea top electrification layer that allows them to generate chargefrom typingfriction (aka contact electrification)  sothe keyboard is able toregister individual keystroke data and track typing style, or to harness typing friction to generate electrical charge for powering other devices.The keyboard identify the force and speed at which the typer input characters. This is not available in todays cell phone at all. The keyboard can identify personality in information input so that it is a high level of security, Zhong Lin Wang, one of the scientists involved in the research, told TechCrunch. The power generated can automatically send signals to the computer so that no power is needed for the keyboard.In apaper detailingthe research project, called Personalized Keystroke Dynamics for Self-Powered HumanMachine Interfacing published in the ACSNano journal the scientists arguethat algorithms whichcan identify who is typingby analyzingkeystroke timing are more limited than their hardware-based approach of typing-induced electric signals, as the latter is also able to sense pressure, as well as speed and strike timing.They write:No external power source is required for the keyboard to function, thanks to its self-powering abilities. So it is evidently a more energy-efficient alternative to tracking typing viacapacitive data that could be harvested from typing ona touchscreen keyboard.How much energycan be generated by typing on the smartkeyboard? Enough tocharge small electronics atarbitrary typing speed greater than 100 characters per min, according to the team which they characterize as a giant leap compared to previous reports.They add:Given such features as self-securing, self-powering, and self-cleaning, as well as unique applicability resulting from distinctive mechanism and one-piece non-mechanical-punching structure, the IKB presented in this work is a practical approach in converting typing motions for self-powered electronics as well as a milestone in the development toward a highly secure behavioral biometrics-based authentication system, which will have extensive applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, cyber security, and computer or network access control.The U.S. Department ofEnergy contributed funding to the research.For more details of the researchread the full paper in ACSNano.The technology is ready for commercialization within a couple of years if some one is willing to invest, addedZhong.
