Microsoft today announced that it has acquired Datazen, a mobile business intelligence and data visualization service.Datazen, which launched about three years ago, allows businesses to create mobile dashboards from data in Microsoft Excel, but also from other cloud and enterprise database sources. To run Datazen, enterprises need to run Windows Server, IIS and .NET behind their firewalls, as well as Datazens server software.The company offers apps for Windows, Windows Phone, iOS, Android and the web. According to todays announcement, all of its products will remain available for the time being and the team will continue to work on Datazens server and client products.Starting today, Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition customers (version 2008 and up) can already download Datazens server software at no cost.Datazen is positioned as a mobile BI solution for customers who need a solution that is implemented on-premises, the Datazen team writes today. As such, it will complement Power BI, Microsofts cloud-based business analytics service.Microsoft will likelyintegrate Datazens technologies and expertise into its Power BI product, but its unclear what the roadmap for this integration looks like. If Microsofts latest acquisitions are any indication, there is a chance that the company will take some of Datazens mobile applications and rebrand them as Power BI for iOS or Android.This acquisition accelerates our Power BI strategy to help organizations create a data culture with easy-to-use, accessible tools to extract maximum value from data  from anywhere, on any device, Microsoft cloud and enterprise director Kamal Hathi writes in todays announcement.He also notes that SQL Server customers love Datazen, because it is optimized for SQL Server Analysis Services and the overall Microsoft platform [].Microsoft has put quite a bit of focus on its business intelligence platforms lately as the amount of data that business create continues to increase rapidly. Todays acquisition fits right into this trend.
