When I met with Buzz Aldrin to discuss his new book No Dream Is Too High: Life Lessons Froma Man Who Walked on the Moon, he described himself as possibly among the luckiest guys.After all, his mother was born in 1903, the same yearthe Wright brothers made their first flight, and Aldrin himself was born less than three decades later. Yet in the span of his own life hes seen the beginnings of the American space program, he went tothe Moon and todayhes still advocating for the next step  Mars. (In fact, we recently wrote about Destination: Mars, a virtual reality project in whichAldrin participated.)Im playing everything I can to serve my country the best I can, he told me. Who are we serving? Generations in the future.Its government competing with the private sector, he said. Noting that many private sector efforts are government-subsidized, he added, The governmentis going to be strongly involved in going to Mars,but they will be relying more and more on contracting industry and telling them what we want. Then the private sector will be in charge of making it happen. But the prescription will not be, Hey, Elon, go do what you want.'Watch the interview above in 360 degrees here:
