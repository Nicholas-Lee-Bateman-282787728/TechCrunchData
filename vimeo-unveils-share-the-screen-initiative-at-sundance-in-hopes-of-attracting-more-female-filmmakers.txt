Vimeo wants more women making films on its platform and is launching a new three-pronged initiative called Share the Screen at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, today to lend financial and other support to talentedfemale filmmakers.Just like in tech, women are woefully underrepresented in the film industry, especially in leadership positions. Women made up just 13 percent of all directors on top Hollywood films in 2014, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film.Whenwe look at the figures and we see just how imbalanced the scales are in terms of the content that were seeing from male versus female voices, we think its important because we can just imagine how much great content and great storytelling isnt making it to audiences and isnt making it to viewers and we want to be a part of helping close that gender equality gap, Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor told TechCrunch.Vimeo hopes to change the ratio by investing in at least five film projects in 2016, starting withthe programs first original short, Darby Forever.Darby Forever from Darby Forever on Vimeo.Written by and starring Saturday Night Lives Aidy Bryant, Darby Forever takes viewers through a story about a shop girl in a bizarre little town and her search for love.Vimeo also pledges to highlight more womenthroughout the site and willadd a new Share the Screen spotlight on the blog as well as make available aFemale-Directed, Vimeo-Approved VOD collection.But Vimeo believes there is hope. Encouragingly we think there are more and more female film directors entering the industry every day, said Trainor. And the web offers it and Vimeo certainly offers it.
