A key tenet of e-commerceis the recommendationengine. If implemented correctly, itcan bea major sales driver for online retailers.However, most sites normally just implement a basic engine that guesseswhat shoppers want, without any input from the shoppers themselves.Shopping Quizzeshas created arecommendation engine that actually asks shoppers what theyre looking for, instead of relying on guesses obtained from their browsing history.Heres how it works:An e-commerceproprietorwill enlist Shopping Quizzes to analyze their product categories and write custom quizzes tailored for a category of product. For example, a site may ask for a quiz designed to help users choose a black dress.The startup will then craft a quiz that asks questions like cocktail or day dress, sleeveless or sleeves andfitted or loose. Then, based on a shoppers answers to allthese questions, the engine recommends three top choices that fit all the shoppers parameters.On the surface, this sounds basic.But the company explained thatdue to the exponential nature of the questions, afour-question quiz can eliminate more than 90 percent of the wrong products, leaving a much higher chance of the shopper finding one they actually want to buy.But does this actually increase sales for the site?According to Shopping Quizs numbers from their beta, yes. One A/B test found that shopperspromptedto use a quiz generated 22 percent more sales than the shoppers who didnt see a quiz.Any online shopper knows quizzes arent new. However, Shopping Quizzes claims to differentiateitself by only asking questions directly relevant to a shoppers end goal. So while other quizzes may decidethat a shopper is preppy or casual and offer a range of products based on that conclusion, each shopping quizwill only recommend three specific products that the shopper already indicated they are interested in purchasing.But this help doesnt come cheap. The company charges anywhere from a lofty $999 for one quiz a month, to an ever more daunting$2,999, which gets a sitefour quizzes per month.At these prices, Shopping Quizzes definitely isnt the right solution for your handcrafted Etsy store. But, if you run a legitimate e-commerce operation and think your large, disorganized inventory is turning off hundreds or thousands of potential customers, this may be the answer for you.
