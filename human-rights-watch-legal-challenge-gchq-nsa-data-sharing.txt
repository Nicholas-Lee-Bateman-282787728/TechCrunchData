A newlegal challenge toU.K.intelligence agencysurveillance practices has been filed in the U.K. by human rights organization Human Rights Watch and three unnamed individuals working in security research, investigative journalism and law. The actionis aimed at ascertaining the scopeof illegal data-sharingthat took place between the NSA and GCHQ.The move follows alandmark legalruling,back in February,whenthe IPT  the court which oversees the U.K.s domestic intelligence agencies  ruled thatprior to December 2014 GCHQ had acted illegally by receiving data from the NSAs surveillance dragnets. It was the first time in the courts 15 year history it had ruled against the agencies.The claims filed today with the IPT will seek to establish whether GCHQ has spied on the claimants, whether their communications were part of those unlawfully shared between NSA and GCHQ, and how the Tribunal is interpreting intelligence sharing, according topro-privacy organization Privacy International, which was one of the groups which brought the earlier legal challenge.This June theIPT also found that GCHQ had acted unlawfully in handling intercepted communications data  although the courtblamed error and technical failures for what it said were breaches of internal policies. That judgment also revealedthat two human rights organizations communications had been targeted by the intelligence agencies  one of which,the IPT subsequently confirmed,was Amnesty International.The revelation that the communications of human rights organizations were being targeted by government intelligence agencies isconsistent with disclosures by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden  who told aEuropean parliamentary hearing back in April 2014 that the NSA had spied on human rights groups.Todays legal action seeks to probe forfurther confirmations of the scopeof U.K. intelligence agency spying activity  such as whether journalists, lawyers and security expertshave also been directly targeted by state surveillance agencies in the recent past.Commenting on todaysaction in a statement,Dinah PoKempner, general counsel at Human Rights Watch, said: Surveillance on a massive scale and data swapping without suspicion or independent oversight pose a grave threat to the lives, safety and work of human rights defenders, researchers, journalists, lawyers and their sources. We are bringing this case because those who work to protect human rights and expose abuses and war crimes depend on confidentiality of communications.In a crowdsourced pincer movement, Privacy International has also today launched what its calling phase two of an earlier attempt to make it easy for any web user to find outwhether GCHQspied on them. The organization previously set up an online form to gather sign-ups and authorizations for itslegal team toact as a go between claimants and the IPT and GCHQ.However, earlier this year, the IPT declined to hear consolidated claims  instead insisting that each potential claimant file his or her own complaint individually. Privacy International has now launched another online mechanismaimed at makingthe process of individual claim-filing easier for people wanting to request information on whether the U.K. spied on them.As of last May more than 25,000 people had signed up under phase one of thecampaign. Those people (and/or organizations) will now need to re-submit individual claims if they wantthe tribunal to take notice oftheirrequests.
