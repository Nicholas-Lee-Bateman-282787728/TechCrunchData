GrabTaxi, the SoftBank-backed Uber rival operating in Southeast Asia, is putting aside a portion of the$330 million in fundingthat itraised over the past 18 monthsto create a welfare fund for its drivers.The company is piloting the initiative in Singapore initially, where it has allocated S$3.5 million (US$2.8 million) to provide financial support for drivers in cases of health issues, accidents andcrisis support.The company didnt specify how many of the 60,000 drivers that it claims overall are based in Singapore, but it did reveal that it will set aside S$300 (US$240) per driver per month. Drivers qualify for the fundbased on howregularly they useGrabTaxi and the standard of their service.Lim Kell Jay, general manager for GrabTaxi Singapore, told TechCrunch that standards would be based on a combination of metrics like customer ratings, and the number of complaints, while the expectation of rides completed would vary per month. The threshold for January is 210 trips on GrabTaxi, for example, Kell Jay said.Drivers willbe able to draw out the remaining funds left in their welfare account at the end of the year, he added.GrabTaxi is present in seven markets across Southeast Asia  where it claims three million downloads and620,000 monthly users but Kell Jay said the company isadopting acountry-by-country approach to the fund and is currently studying potential expansions.GrabTaxi, which landeda $250 million investment from SoftBank in December, is Ubers primary rival in Southeast Asia. Rocket Internet-backed Easy Taxicompetes in a number of markets  though it has withdrawn from India and other markets while Hailo is present in Tokyo and Singapore.The move to offer drivers welfareis the latest in a steady war of attrition to attract both customers and the drivers that transport them around.Uber has a vehicle licensing program, which expanded into India last year but has not reached Southeast Asia yet. To date, Uber and GrabTaxi have sparred by racing to launch new expansions and offering aggressive price cuts/promotions across Southeast Asia, nowit looks like the rivalry to recruit and retain drivers in the region will increase too.GrabTaxi is one of three taxi-hailing app companies in Asia that isbacked by Japanese telco giant SoftBank. BuzzFeed recently reported that there are plans foran alliance between thefirms, and minor U.S. player Flywheel, though SoftBank saidit has no immediate plan to link them up, according to a statement given to us last week.Nonetheless, information sharing between portfolio companies is common, andseems likely that SoftBank-backed Ola (India) and Kuadi Dache (China) will be be keen observers of this GrabTaxi pilot.
