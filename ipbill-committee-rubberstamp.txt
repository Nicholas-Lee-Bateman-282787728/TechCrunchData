The U.K. government is being accused of once again trying to fast track complex and controversial surveillance legislation. Yknow, remember DRIPA?Thedraft Investigatory Powers Bill, which will replace DRIPA when that legislation expires at the end of next year,was introduced to parliament earlier this month,with Home Secretary Theresa May telling MPsthere would be adequate time afforded for careful Parliamentary scrutiny of the proposed legislation, including by a special cross-bench committee.However theamount of time this joint select committee is being afforded to scrutinize a document that runs to some 300-pages has been slammed as inadequate  including by members of the committee itself.The committee is expected to report by February 11, 2016, giving it only a few weeks to conduct expert hearings beforeparliament breaks for theholiday period  with perhaps only as few as three expert hearings likely to be possible within the current timetable.The House of Commons breaks forChristmas recess from December 17 to January 5.While the deadline for written submissionsto the committee is today  meaning just 10 days havebeen afforded to gather wider responses on factors such as the technical feasibility, costs and cyber security issues, as well as onimpacts on U.K. citizens and businesses.By contrast the prior attempt to legislate in this area, the 2012Data Communications bill, was afforded some five months of parliamentary time for scrutiny  and ultimately failed to convince MPs its measures were proportionate.The IP billnot only seeksto enshrine in U.K. law controversial mass surveillance powers that only came to light after the Snowden disclosures  and which U.K. intelligence agencies hadbeen using for years without a clear oversight regime. But it also expands surveillance capabilities by, for instance, putting a requirement on ISPs tokeep records of users web activity for a full 12 months.There are also concerns about the implications of the bill for strong encryption, and controversy around its sanctioning ofbulk hacking powers by the intelligence and security agencies  with the suggestion that tech companies could be compelled to backdoor their services to provide access to government agencies.On web activity logging, the Home Secretaryargues thatthe intelligence and security agencies need to be able to find out which Internet services a suspect might have been using. However thetechnical feasibility of determining this from theso-called Internet Connection Records set outin the bill has been called into question by ISPs.Bottom line, the select committee is being expected to interrogatea highly complex interlocking webof technical, legal and ethical issuesin far less time than was afforded the last piece of proposed legislation in this area.In a tweet earlier this week one of the members of the committee, Liberal Democrat Peer Lord Strasburger, dubbed the timetable set out by government as ridiculous, noting that as it stands the committee willhave just two weeks to hear witnesses.Ridiculous. Committee scrutinising massive Investigatory Powers Bill given just 2 weeks to hear witnesses. Govt turning it into rubber stamp Paul Strasburger (@LordStras) November 25, 2015Today he tweeted that the committee is attempting to get more time from the government so we can do a proper job  but added: Theyre not budging yet.Committee scrutinising Investigatory Powers Bill trying to get more time from govt so we can do a proper job. They're not budging yet. Paul Strasburger (@LordStras) November 27, 2015A Home Office spokesman told TechCrunch the House of Lords agreed the schedule for the scrutinycommittee with no opposition at all, adding that the time to challenge the timetable would have been when the Lords had the hearing.The committee has two and a half months for its report, the spokesmanadded.
