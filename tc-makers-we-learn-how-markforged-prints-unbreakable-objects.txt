We first met the folks at MarkForged at CES where they showed us their printer that could create nearly unbreakable objects. By weaving carbon fiber between layers of plastic, the team made some of the coolest 3D printed objects weve ever seen.I went to Boston where we met MarkForgeds founder Greg Mark who walked us through his workshop from start to finish. There we saw early prototypes and the final product and learned what it takes to make 3D prints out of the hardest stuff on earth.
