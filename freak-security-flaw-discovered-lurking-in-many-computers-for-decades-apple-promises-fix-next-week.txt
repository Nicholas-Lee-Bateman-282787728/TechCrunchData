Ugh  another week, another nasty widespread security bug to worry about. The twist this time: this one has apparently been around since the 90s.Dubbed FREAK by the researchers who discovered it, the exploit allowed researchers (and potentially hackers) to sniff traffic going to and from many otherwise encrypted websites  including some government sites  thanks to some stuff left behind from the 90s.Heres the issue, as I understand it:The short version: hackers force a victims connection to use long-forgotten encryption ciphers left behind in popular products (Android, Apples Safari) instead of todays stronger stuff, then decrypt the data.As of this morning at 1 a.m., researchers were able to coax a good chunk of the webs most popular sites into accepting the now-obsolete encryption request.Theyve put up a list of some of the sites here, and its a doozy. Banking sites, quite a few retail sites, and even a few U.S. government sites make an appearance.Named by the researchers as one of the larger parties at risk here, Apple was quick to respond with a promise to fix things on their end. Writes an Apple spokesperson:We have a fix in iOS and OS X that will be available in software updates next week.Weve reached out to other companies involved for comment.Update: Google says it has made a patch that has been provided to partners. That likely means its on device manufacturers to patch this on a phone-by-phone basis. We encourage all websites to disable support for export certificates. Androids connections to most websites  which include Google sites, and others without export certificates  are not subject to this vulnerability.  We have also developed a patch to protect Androids connection to sites that do expose export certs and that patch has been provided to partners.
