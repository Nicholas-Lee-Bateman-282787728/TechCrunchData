Salesforce announced today that vice chairman and president Keith Block was also taking the role of Chief Operating Office at the cloud CRM giant.That gives him three major executive roles and a seat on Salesforces board for those keeping score at home.When Salesforce landed Block a couple of years ago, it was a major coup for them. Block had spent more than 25 years at rival Oracle and getting him in the fold was a big deal.At a press conference last fall at the companys Dreamforce customer conference, Block discussedthe companys goals. We are about growth and customer success he said. He talked about the company strategy to achieve that, which involved always driving product choices toward helping users service their customers, however that manifested itself.His boss Marc Benioff was effusive in a statement announcing the change. In his expanded role, Keith will bring stronger alignment across our customer-facing and company operations. I look forward to working even more closely with him to deliver customer success and achieve our goal to surpass $10 billion in revenue faster than any other enterprise software company in history.Block is going to have a full plate with his new title as he tries to push the company toward that $10 billion goal. Hewill continue to lead global sales, alliances and channels, industry strategy, customer success and consulting services. If that werent enough to fill a day, he will also oversee the companys day-to-day operations.In his spare time, Blockserves on the Board of Trustees for Carnegie Mellon University, the Advisory Board at Carnegie Mellon University Heinz Graduate School and the Board of Trustees at the Concord Museum. He also helps out with an educational program called Boston Partners in Education, a program designed to help Boston school children.The COO role has been vacant since George Hu left last fall to run startup Peer, an HR app thatfocuses on providing employee feedback, which was backed by Hus former boss Marc Benioff.
