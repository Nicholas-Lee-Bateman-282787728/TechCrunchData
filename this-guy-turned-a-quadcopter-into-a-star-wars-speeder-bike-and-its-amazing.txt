Okay, this is the last quadcopter-to-Star Wars Universe-thing we (or at least I) will post*, I promise.[* this week]BUT SERIOUSLY, LOOK AT THIS THING. It is perfection. About 30 seconds into the video, I actually stood up and whooped.Weve seen the Millenium Falcon quadcopter. Weve seen a TIE Interceptor quadcopter.But a Speeder Bike? WITH a Scout trooper on top? This this is perfect. It brings one of the best scenes from Return Of The Jedi to life in an straight up magical way.By gutting a 1999 Hasbro POTF Speederbike and strapping its bits to a low-flying quadcopter, Adam Woodworth has made a toy that would have made 12 year old Greg throw every penny of his allowance at the screen. Hahah, who am I kidding; Now-28 year old Greg would throw all his money at this, too.You can read about Adams full build process, including figuring out how to get that relatively-heavy frame up in the air, right over here.If only there was a camera in the helmet for first-person tree-dodging footage.. OH WAIT, THERE IS.Dear Disney: make this. Seriously. [via makezine; Photos via Adam Woodworth)
