After a very long wait for long-promised autopilot features, Model S owners in Hong Kong were surely unhappy to discover yesterday that those same features have now been remotely disabled.According to the International Business Times, Hong Kong officials told Tesla to remove the semiautonomous driving technology until authorities can confirm the features are safe.Teslas autopilot features enable the Model S to control a drivers direction for miles on end, with no hand contact on the steering wheel. They also executes lane changes on command and enable automatic parallel parking when conditions permit.Perhaps unsurprisingly, some abuse of the features have followed. For example, onedriver thought it would be a good idea to shave in the front seat. Another climbed into the back seatof a Model S to test the reliability of the software.Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed the unsettling trend earlier this month on an earnings call, suggesting that Tesla itself plans to add more limiting features to the technology.Theres been some fairly crazy videos on YouTube, said Musk. [] this is not good. And we will be putting some additional constraints on when Autopilot can be activated to minimize the possibility of people doing crazy things with it.In Hong Kong, at least, Tesladoesnt appear to have a choice. As the company wrote to its car customers yesterday: The Autosteer and Auto Lane Change functions in our recent 7.0 software update are still pending approval from Hong KongsTransport Department.To ensure we comply with the countrys regulators, we will be temporarily turning off thesetwofunctions on all Model S in Hong Kong effective immediately.The IBT storycites a Tesla Motor Club forum member who says a similar situation is taking place in Japan, but Teslaisnt commenting on other challenges to its technology elsewhere in the world.Either way, its an eye-openingdevelopment and surely one that the auto industry will be following closely, given that other carmakers offer similar features, including Mercedes Benz, whoseS-Class offers what it callsIntelligent Drive.
