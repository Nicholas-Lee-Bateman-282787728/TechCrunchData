Despite on-goingbelt-tightening of the U.K.s public finances, theres going to be more taxpayer cash and support up for grabs forcyber security startups starting from early 2016.YesterdayChancellor George Osborne named the techsectoras a priority area, setting out a plan to boost related government spending over the next five years with the aim ofbolstering domestic intelligence capabilities and defending U.K. critical infrastructure and ecommerce activity from hackers.The government alsowants to explore ways to work more closely with ISPs to try to divert malware attacks and blockknown malicious URLs.Bolstering the regulation framework around critical national infrastructure is anothergovernment priority in this area, he said.Giving a speech at the GCHQ intelligence agency, Osborne announced a plan to nearly double spending on cyber security investment  with 1.9 billion to be spent by 2020 (although total government cyber security spending, so also addingcore capabilities to protect its own infrastructure and networks, brings thetotal to more than 3.2 billion).He dubbed it a bold, comprehensive programme that will give Britain the next generation of cyber security, and make Britain one of the safest places to do business on line.Thespending increase will specifically go towards adding 1,900 new staff across the U.K.s three intelligence agencies, andsetting upa new National Cyber Centre, which will report to the director of GCHQ  allowing the new Centreto tap into classified expertise.Osborne said the aim with the Centre isto create a one-stop-shop for cyber security advice and support, staffed by adedicated cyber force', replacing the current array of bodies with a single point of contact to make it easier for industry to get government support on cyber security matters and vice versa.It will give us a unified platform to handle incidents as they arise, ensuring a faster and more effective response to major attacks.And we will build in the National Cyber Centre a series of teams, expert in the cyber security of their own sectors, from banking to aviation, but able to draw on the deep expertise here, and advise companies, regulators, and government departments, headded.As part of the security funding bump  and partly funded by it, along with funding from the Defence budget he also detailed a new165 million Defence and Cyber Innovation Fund specifically aimed at widening government procurement when it comes to security technologies by bringing startups into the mix.We will create a 165 million Defence and Cyber Innovation Fund, to support innovative procurement across both defence and cyber security, he said. It will mean that we support our cyber sector at the same time as investing in solutions to the hardest cyber problems that government faces.A Treasury spokesman confirmed this pot of money will be specifically for investing instartups building cyber security technologies that are of interest to the government andits intelligence agencies.Its to invest in startups that are working in areas that overlap with and are in line with what the government and the intelligence agencies believe are the important areas to strengthen in our innovation, the spokesmantold TechCrunch.So when they see areas of overlap they will invest.The government is not revealing which specific securitytech priority areas its most interested in at this stage  albeit presumably startups offering robust end-to-end encryption need not apply (givenongoing criticism of companies use ofthis techby senior government ministers, the Prime Minister and U.K. intelligence chiefs).Its also not clear how the 165 million will be assignedand dividedbetween startups that are buildingtechnologies that align with government surveillance and cyber security priorities. Nor whether startups have to be founded in the U.K.The spokesman said more details will be provided about how the fund will operateby early next year.Government-backed Passion Capital founding Partner Eileen Burbidge, who is also Chair of Tech City UK and an active investor in security startups as well as an advisory board member of the recently launched London-based cyber security incubator CyLon, said the fund is loosely inspired by In-Q-Tel  aka the CIAs VC arm.Does Burbidge see anycontradiction in the U.K. government pushing an anti-encryption message, on the one hand, yetbanging the drum for improved cyber security on the other?I do not find the announcement of a Fund to support the cyber security industry in Britain at all in any kind of conflict about other statements or rhetoric regarding what law enforcement might need/want for national security, she told TechCrunch.I think increasing Britains capability to lead in cybersecurity defense (and offense which Chancellor also mentioned yesterday) is very good And will even go to help foster and create other solutions and means for reassuring citizens about safety of systems online Which maybe helps to quell unhelpful or technically inarticulate statements about encryption for example.Bottom line we need to get smarter/better about security in general; thats how we get away from making blanket statements or implications out of reaction  which lead to confusion and concern, she added.Giving one hint of tech areas the government is interested in, Osborne said itintends to ramp up both cyber security defence and offence  the latter via an existing partnership between GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence, called the National Offensive Cyber Programme.We are building our own offensive cyber capability  a dedicated ability to counter-attack in cyberspace, he said.And we will now commit the resources to develop and improve this capability over the next five years.Osborne said the government will also be establishing two cyber security co-working spacesforearly stage startups  apparently taking a leaf out of thestartupincubator playbook. Albeit its not clear how these government cyber innovation centres will operate as yet.Osborne said these will be places where cyber start-ups can base themselves in their crucial early months, and which can become platforms for giving those start-ups the best possible support.On working more closely with ISPs to try to cut off access to malware, Osborne added: Internet service providers already divert their customers from known bad addresses, to prevent them from being infected with malware.We will explore whether they can work together  with our help  to provide this protection on a national level.We cannot create a hermetic seal around the country  indeed it wouldnt be in our interests to have one  but with the right systems and tools our private internet service providers could kick out a high proportion of the malware in the UK internet, and block the addresses which we know are doing nothing but scamming, tricking and attacking British internet users.Let us try to get to the point where all the internet service providers will as a matter of routine divert known bad addresses.The government haspreviously leant on ISPs to do more to help tackle extremism online  securing agreement from four major U.K. ISPs to host a public reporting button for extremist and terrorist material online this time last year.More recently, ISPs are also at the coreof government plans to overhaulsurveillance legislation and plug what it terms capability gaps in intelligence gathering in the digital era. The draft Investigatory Powers Bill requires that ISPs capture and retain details ofU.K. web users browsing habits for 12 months so the datacan be available to intelligence and law enforcement agencies.Another focusfor the governments increased spending on cyber security is spending to try to boost tech skills, with Osborne announcing a plan to run a 20 million competition to open a new Institute of Coding to plug what heconceded is still a gap in higher education aroundhigh level digital and computer science skills.There will also be a push to create higher and degree level apprenticeships in key sectors  starting withfinance and energy;a government funded retraining program for highly skilled workers wanting to move into the cyber security sector; and aprogrammodeled on an Israeli scheme that aims tofoster cyber skills in14- to 17-year-olds.
