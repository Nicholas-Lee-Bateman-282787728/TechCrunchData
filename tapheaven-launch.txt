The pitch for TapHeaven might sound a little familiar. Co-founder and CEO Chris Hoyt said his technology delivers truly automated ad-buying.What makes TapHeaven more than just another ad startup that talks a big game about its technology? Well, it says its actually delivering bigresults with its first dozen pilot partners  many of them, Hoyt said, have seen their user acquisition costs fall by 50 percent.He added that some of thoseadvertisershave alreadyswitched to using TapHeaven exclusively, dropping their other demand-side platforms (those are the ad-buying platforms that allow them to work with multiple ad exchanges and data providers).The technology out there was very weak, he said. Theres so much wasted ad spend through the human-based processes that are rampant in our industry.TapHeaven is backed by startup studio ventureLab and its officially launching its Sonar Intelligence product today.Given alack of prior experience in advertising, Hoyt and his co-founders Jeremy Jones and Brian Krebs (pictured above) might not be the most obvious candidates to build a serious ad-tech company, but Hoyt pointed to Krebs background in enterprise technology, and he said that they developed TapHeaven by working closely with one of the top companies in mobile gaming. (Krebs said he cant disclose the name of thatcompany or of TapHeavens other advertisers.)Having that customer guide you  theyre using our competitors, they know what the weaknesses are and they know what the technology is capable of, he said.He added that the big request was to directly connect the advertisersperformance data to TapHeavens algorithms, so the ad-buying is guided by an accurate measure of a customers value. More broadly, Hoyt said TapHeaven isnt just a black box for advertisers, but instead allows them to add their own guidelines to the process.And while TapHeavens platform was built to meet the needs of a gaming advertiser, Hoyt argued that it should appeal to brand advertisers too, particularly because everyone is going to become a performancemarketer at some point.
