Im in Las Vegas for this whole week, which means two things. One, I hate myself. Two, Im constantly out at restaurants, which makes it even harder than usual to eat healthily.MyFitnessPal, the popular nutrition and fitness app that was acquired by Under Armour last year, is unveiling a new feature today that should help. The appalready allows you to log your meals at restaurants  in fact, co-founder Albert Lee said users are logging restaurant menu items every 3.2 seconds.However, MyFitnessPal now includes nutritional data about a much broader swath of restaurants, and it makes it easy to look that information up before you order. Its been pretty clear to us for some time now that one big pain point is how to make a healthy choice when theyre eating out at a restaurant, Leesaid.The new featureincludes menu information from 500,000 restaurants nationwide  not just big chains, Lee said, but also single outlet restaurants.MyFitnessPal isworking with Foursquare to get a lot of that menu data. Of course, manyof those restaurants dont provide any nutritional information publicly. In those cases, Lee said MyFitnessPal employs data science tomake an estimate based on the information available. Users can also provide feedback on those estimates, so they should getbetter over time.MyFitnessPal says its rolling the new feature out to iOS users, with Android to come.
