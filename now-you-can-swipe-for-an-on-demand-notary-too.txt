On-demand services have taken off, much to the delight of pretty much everyone who uses them.Now we can add notary services to the list of convenienceswe can call up with a tapon our iPhones thanks to Notarize, a months-old startup with offices in Alexandria, Va., and in Boston. It offersa 24-hour service that enablespeople in all 50 states to have their documents notarized remotely. [Yay.]If youve experienced the ridiculousnessof having totrack down a notary, this may all sound too good to be true.And it would have been until very recently. But in 2011, Virginia passed a bill allowing documents to be notarized remotely, using audio-video technology.Founder and CEO Pat Kinseldiscovered this law soon after learning, while on vacation, that a brokerage couldnt accept a document that hed given to a notary who lost track of it.Kinselwho cofounded an earlier company called Spindle that sold to Twitter and who is today also a venture partner with Polaris Partnerssays that out of his own intellectual curiosity, I started researching this in my spare time.One of the things Kinsellearned? That theres a $30 billion potential market opportunity to chase, given that an estimated onebillion documents get notarized annually in the U.S. (Many are these are done for free, we should mention, but Notarize is charging $25 per document for its ease of use.)As an investor in the Boston-based on-demand alcohol delivery company Drzly which has apparently done quite a bit of verification work to ensure its drivers are at least 21 years oldKinsel also knew there existed powerful ways of verifying IDs that would comply with the law.Thus was born Notarize, which is available as an iOS application alone (right now) and that functions like a traditional notary, but moves the entire process online.Clients verify they are who they say with a government issued photo IDthatNotarize authenticates using computer imagingtechnology and some kind of software-basedforensic analysis. The personis then connected with acommissioned Virginia Electronic Notary Public agent via live video call. (Notarize has 24 agents at the ready as of this writing.) The agent then completes theprocess using digital tools, after which the client canprint and deliver the notarized document or send it electronically to whomever is waiting on it.The companyisnt saying how much it collects versus gives to its agents.Notarizeisnt the first to take advantage of that Virginia law, either, though Kinsel argues convincinglythat its the first to do it in earnest. (Do a search and not much turns up.)Kinsel also thinks theres plenty of low-hanging fruit to go after as the company tests out its concept, including search traffic, which he estimates is a $100 million addressable opportunityalone.Investorsseem very prepared to gamble on the idea, in any case. Notarize has raised$2.4 million inseed funding led by Polaris Partners.Other participants in the round include theDetroit-based seed-stage firm Ludlow Ventures and individualinvestors.You can see a fairly funny video explaining the service here:
