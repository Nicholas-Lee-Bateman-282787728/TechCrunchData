Its a security project thats taken around a year and a halfto complete, but messaging giant WhatsApphas now fully implementedstrongend-to-end encryption onitsplatform and across all mobile platforms for which itoffers apps.This meansusers of the latest versions of the messaging appwill have their commsand media end-to-end encrypted by default. And there are a lot of WhatsApp users; earlier this year the Facebook owned companyannounced it had passeda billion active users.Securing cross-platform video comms was the last piece of the puzzle, according to a WhatsApp spokesman.End-to-end encryptionmeans the content of communications arenot stored in plaintext on WhatsApps servers. Nor isthe company able to decryptusers messages to access them since it does not hold the encryption keys. SoWhatsApp willbe unable to be compelledto hand over messaging data  even if served with a warrant byauthorities demanding access.While the WhatsApp newsmay seem timely in light of the recent high-profile battle between Apple and the FBI over an encrypted iPhone, the companyhas in fact been implementing encryption since 2013, the year NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden triggered a global privacy storm by revealing the extent of government mass surveillance programs.WhatsApp then went on to partner with Open Whisper Systems the following year, and has been integrating its widely respected end-to-end encryption Signal Protocol specificallysince late 2014.In a blogpost todaythe not-for-profit hacker collective behind the latter open source tech confirmedthe WhatsApp implementation is nowcomplete.This includes chats, group chats, attachments, voice notes, and voice calls across Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, Nokia S40, Nokia S60, Blackberry, and BB10, it wrote. Users running the most recent versions of WhatsApp on any platform now get full end to end encryption for every message they send and every WhatsApp call they make when communicating with each other.Although the completion of default end-to-end encryption is a hugely important security milestone for the WhatsApp platform,it does not mean that from here on in every communication sent via the appis end-to-end encrypted,because thats relianton all users being upgraded to the latest version of the software.But the WhatsApp clientwill now notify users of the encryption status of chats, including showing a notice in the messaging screen, to help bridge thetransitional phase:Eventually all the pre-e2e [end-to-end] capable clients will expire, at which point new versions of the software will no longer transmit or accept plaintext messages at all, notesOpen Whisper Systems.WhatsApp users will also be able to confirm the person they are chatting with is the person they think it is, rather thanan imposter performing a man-in-the-middle attack,by verifying the authenticity of the encryption session via scanning a QR code or reading aloud a number string.For its part, Open Whisper Systems says it is looking ahead to additionalrollouts of its tech, saying it will continue to work with additional messengers over the next year.The group also has its own encrypted messaging app, Signal, which launched in March last year. Albeit, the question now is whetherEdward Snowden will be switching to WhatsAppI use Signal every day. #notesforFBI (Spoiler: they already know) https://t.co/KNy0xppsN0 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) November 2, 2015
