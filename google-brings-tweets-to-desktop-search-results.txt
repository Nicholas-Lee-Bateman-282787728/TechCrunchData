Back in May, Google and Twitter partnered to bring tweets into mobile search results. It was, and is, a pretty big deal for both companies.The relationship is apparently going well, as Google announced in a short update on its original blog post that itd be including tweets within search results on desktop as well:Update, 8/21/2015: Weve extended this to desktop now too, and in English everywhere.You got it, @google. We'll bring the Tweets.  Twitter (@twitter) August 21, 2015It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that this means more tweets surfacing, which is great for Twitter. If someone were to come across a tweet, like the ones illustrated above, and feel like they want to jump into the conversation, thats a reason for them to sign up.Google helps you search for things and Twitter/Tweets help you find what people are saying about things. Its a marriage made in heaven, which is why the rumors have always swirled about the search giant acquiring Twitter. Those rumors might kick up again now that its stock is hovering just above the original IPO price (its currently $26.50).
