Startup studio Expa is unveiling its newest company today  Spot, which promises to help users to find the best places in the world.In other words, Spot will deliver personalized recommendations for things like restaurants, bars, stores and hotels. You can use it as a guide when youre traveling, or to explore your home city.The app isnt launching today  its in private beta testing right now, but company lead Luke Groesbeck (previously co-founder of Job Alchemist and consumer product lead at Eventbrite) is ready to talk about the basics of the product, and about his vision.When it comes to local discovery and travel guides, Groesbeck acknowledged that Yelp and Trip Advisor dominate, but he said they came to prominence in the early days of the web. His aim with Spot is build a mobile company that works as well in your corner as it does on the other side of the world.There have also been other startups trying to do something similar, and they havent exactly taken off. Groesbeck said its a really hard problem, but what other companies have focused on is the design side of the equation  they tried to design a better Yelp, a better Trip Advisor. And once they built it, they assumed users would provide all the actual recommendations.In this day and age you cannot rely entirely on user generated content to build something thats going to work at scale, he said. One of the things we have thats different is global reach and local depth. The way we do that is, were trying to do for the real world what Google has done for the web.For starters, Spot is crawling the web to see how people are discussing different locations. Its also trying to bring on travel experts and local curators, particularly during this beta phase.As I said up top, Spot is part of Expa, the startup studio created by StumbleUpon and Uber co-founder Garrett Camp. The first company to launch out of Expa was restaurant app-maker Reserve.You can sign up for Spots private beta here.
