San Francisco-based startupLifeliqe (pronounced life like) debutedand demoed itsnew virtual reality, educational content experience from the floor of the Augmented World Expo 2016 this week.According to co-founder and CEO Ondrej Homola, Lifeliqe spent the last three years creating a library of high-quality, interactive VR content.The patience may have paid off, as the results are pretty impressive.Using HTCs Vive as the hardware to demo the content, Lifeliqes experiencesallow students tovirtually examinea satellite in space, climb on dinosaurs from the jurassicperiod or evenexamineshark anatomies (from the inside out).This new VR capabilitywill jointhe companys existing, eponymous, tablet productthat is already in usewith over 15,000 schools across the globe (mostly in Europe). The tablet content is also compelling and fun to use (see below) although not as immersive as their VR counterparts. However thecombination of content will simplygive teachers more options for how to engage their students.The companys thesis is that ifstudents can participate in a variety of learning situations that are deeply immersive and interactive, their retention and interest will increase. This makes sense, as I can easily see how these learning scenarios could keep kids attention.Lifeliqe is planning for itsVR contentto hit the market in the second half of this year and it isstill vetting exactly which hardware platform tobuild for.
