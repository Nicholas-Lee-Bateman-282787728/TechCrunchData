Thingiverse, Makerbots collection of public 3D models, is one of the keys to its continued success. However, thus far it has been a fairly lonely affair with users uploading their models and interacting with individuals only rarely. Now theres Thingiverse Groups, a small tweak that lets you create an online group of like-minded makers.Quoth the Makerbot blog:Its not a huge change but I could definitely see the value in having, say, a UAV group or a group dedicated to education. Being able to share models and ideas with the group makes 3D printing a lot more fun and, more important, stickier. For example, I made this group in a few seconds and now I wait, breathlessly, as parents stream in from around the world. Should be fun.
