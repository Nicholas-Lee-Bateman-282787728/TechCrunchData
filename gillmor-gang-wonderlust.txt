The Gillmor Gang  John Borthwick, Robert Scoble, Dan Farber, Keith Teare, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Friday, July 10, 2015. To my horror, the entire Gang agrees with The Robert and his passion for All Shiny Things VR. I say if the Watch is dead, long live the Watch. Plus, the latest G3 (below) with Halley Suitt Tucker, Rebecca Woodcock, Rosanna Y de la Cruz, Elisa Camahort Page,  and Tina Chase Gillmor.@stevegillmor, @borthwick, @dbfarber, @scobleizer, @kteare, @kevinmarksProduced and directed by Tina Chase Gillmor @tinagillmorLiner NotesLive chat streamThe Gillmor Gang on FacebookG3: Indivisible InkG3 on Facebook
