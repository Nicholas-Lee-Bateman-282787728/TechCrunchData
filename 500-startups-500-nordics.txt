Just ahead of the Slush tech confab in Helsinki this week, 500 Startups has revealedplans for its latest regional fund: the startup investment group is raising $15 million for 500 Nordics, which it will use for its accelerator program, seed investing and distribution and marketing programs.The target is to fund 100 or more startups across Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland.A Form D filed with the SEC today lists 500s Dave McClure, Christine Tsai and Sean Percival as executive officers, but it will be Percival who has been and will continue to runthe operation day-to-day, initially out of Norway.This is not the first we have heard of 500 Nordics.There were a few reports that mentioned the operation in passing as evidence of 500 Startups increasing interest in developing regional operations globally. That has also included microfunds across Asia, most recently a $30 million fund in Japan.A profile of500 Nordics on AngelListdescribes itas apre-accelerator, an intensive 1 month program hosted in Oslo, Norway.The AngelList profile notes that 500 Nordics is currently accepting applications for the first program startingin January 2016. 500 Nordics proposes toinvest $10,000 in exchange for a 2% equity stake a startup and it charges a$3,000program feein addition to that, netting a startup in the program a $7,000 investment.The program at 500 Nordics sounds similar to what 500 Startups offers at home base and further afield, withparticipating startups receiving a number of awesome talks, office hours, events, and hands-on mentorship in customer acquisition, international expansion, analytics, design and UX, fundraising, business development, and much much more.From what we understand, theidea behind putting 500 Nordics first in Oslo was tobuild an accelerator in another cityto balance or complement, depending on how you look at it  the technology centres that already existin Stockholm and Helsinki.Thesewere originally built around legacy giants like Nokia and Ericsson, with a new wave of startup innovation coming from a windfall of startups that were either founded and/or staffed by talent coming out of those companies and the institutions built to train people to work for them. Companies coming out of these two citiesinclude a fair number of game-changing startups, includingSkype, Spotify, Rovio and Supercell.
