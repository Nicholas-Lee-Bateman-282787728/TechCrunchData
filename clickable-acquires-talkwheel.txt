Talkwheel, a company that offers a unique way to visualize customer conversations, has been acquired by Clickable.I last wrote about Talkwheel in 2014. The company aggregates the online conversation around a given company or topic in a circular format  its supposed to help you follow these often complicated and dispersed conversations. The format can then be embedded on a brands website, offering one place where users can catch up on and participate in the broader conversation.Founder and CEO Jeff Harris said that Talkwheel has seen its revenuegrow by about 400 percent annually over the past two years. At the same time, theres been a lot of consolidation going in the social media marketing space, and Talkwheel began acquisition discussions with another company (not Clickable) in late 2015. Ultimately, Harris said Clickable was the better fit  he praised its listening and social media monitoring tools and said Talkwheel adds that consumer-facing piece to the Clickable platform.The financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed. Harris said it involved a mix of cash and equity, with Talkwheel continuing to function as an independent organization and product under the Clickable umbrella, while also looking for potential integrations. The entire nine-person Talkwheel team will be joining, at least for the transition process, with Harris himself staying on for the foreseeable future.Talkwheel had raised $1.5 million in funding from various angel investors.
