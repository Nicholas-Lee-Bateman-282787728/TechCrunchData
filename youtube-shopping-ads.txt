YouTube videos are goingto get more shoppable, with the company announcing a new ad unit today called Shopping ads.The Google-owned video site has been moving in this direction for the past few months, with the introduction of Cards for related content (including merchandise) and the launch ofTrueView for shopping, which allowsadvertisers to automatically turn their Google merchant data into product cards.While both of these features are great for making advertiser videos more shoppable, Shopping ads bring this functionality to all videos on YouTube, the company says.The point is, Google really wants advertisers to promote their products on YouTube and to allow consumers to start the purchase process directly from those videos.So if youre watching something on YouTube, you might start seeing an info icon on the upper right corner of the video.
