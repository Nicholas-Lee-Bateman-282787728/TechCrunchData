Even in an uncertain market, top venture firms seem to have no trouble locking down huge capital commitments from their investors. This week, Accel announced $2 billion in funding. Last week, Lightspeed Venture Partners announced $1.2 billion across two new funds.GGV Capital is meanwhile raisingtwo funds totaling more than $1 billion.Union Square Ventures, the New York-based venture firm thathas among the best track records in the business right now, has seeminglydecided to stick with what it does best: invest in early-stage deals out of a comparatively much smaller fund. Specifically, according to a new SEC filing first spied by Fortune, the firmhas just closed on $166.8 million, which is very much in the same ballpark as its last fund, closed in 2012.At that time, USV had raised a separate, $175 million opportunities fund to make additional investments in its most promising portfolio companies. This time around, USV isnt raising a similarside fund.As Fortune notes, USV, which is run by five general partners  cofoundersFred Wilson and Brad Burnham,along withAlbert Wegner, John Buttrick and Andrew Weissman has an overallinternal rate of return of60.85 through last November, according to the University of Texas Investment Management Company (known as UTIMCO).Some of USVs best-known bets include Lending Club, which went public in 2013; Etsy, which went public last year; Tumblr, acquired by Yahoo in a $1.1 billion deal in 2013; and Foursquare, which raised new funding in a down round in January.Wilson, who will be speaking at our upcoming Disrupt conference taking place in New York May 9 through May 11, recently railed publicly against companies that stay private for too long, saying of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in particular:Hes wimping out.That should be a publicly traded company.Adding that Ubers investors will want their money back at some point (USV is not among its investors), Wilsonadded: You cant just say f you. Take the goddamn company public.
