Im just going to be honest with you. We record the Gadgets Podcast on Thursday and publish it on Friday. We can usually get away with it, but on the eve of Apple Watch pre-orders, we had a hard time faking it. In the time between recording, the Apple Watch went from being available only through the words of early reviewers to being up for pre-order to being delayed to June shipping.We discuss early impressions of the Apple Watch and the newly launched Galaxy S6 and curved-display Galaxy S6 Edge.Check out the somewhat grumpy conversation on this weeks episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast featuring Matt Burns, Jordan Crook,and John Biggs.We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here.Click here to download an MP3 of this show.
