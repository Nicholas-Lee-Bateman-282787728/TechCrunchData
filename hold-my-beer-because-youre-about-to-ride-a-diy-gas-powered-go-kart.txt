If youve ever dreamt of pulling a Little Rascals and riding down a massive hill on a wooden scooter, have we got a Kickstarter for you. The PlyFly Go-Kart is a flat-pack built-it-yourself go-kart that runs on a gasoline engine and can go up to 25 miles per hour. The kit is made of cut wood and assembles in about a day. It includes a 2.5 or 4 HP gas engine for maximum rev action.The kits cost $745 for the less powerful model or $845 for the more powerful one. They can both fit a normal-sized adult male and they look like theyre great fun.Created by Flat.Works, the kits are marvel of flat-pack engineering. The parts are pushed out of a piece wood and assemble with simple tools. The company was founded by Tim Moulton and is looking for $36,000 to fund their project.While it might be cheaper (and safer) to just head down to your local Gran Prix kart raceway, I suspect the joy of building and riding your very own go-kart might outweigh the risks associated with giving adults a powerful little rig to scoot around on during the odd Fourth of July bacchanal or a Bohemian Grove get-together. While it doesnt beat strapping bottle rockets to the back of your three-speed Schwinn, it might be the next best thing.
