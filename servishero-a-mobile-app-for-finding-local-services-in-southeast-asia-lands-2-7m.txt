ServisHero, a company that provides local services on-demand via a mobile app in Southeast Asia, has landed a$2.7 million investmentled by Golden GateVentures.Founded last June, ServisHero is based in Malaysia but already the service is available in Singapore and  as of today  Thailand too. This round, which is billed as a pre-Series A, also included participation fromCradle Seed Ventures, a funded affiliated with Malaysias government.The premise behind ServisHero is connecting local service providers with customers, and giving customers choice from multiple merchants.CEOKarl Loo came upon the idea when visiting his native Malaysia after stints working overseas. (Loo worked for Groupon in China, Koreas Memebox and Africa Internet Accelerator among other projects.) He told TechCrunch in an interview that he was amazed that mobile apps could be used to hail cars and other services, yet fixing an air conditioning unit or finding a maid is based on offline advertisements  in Malaysia many of those are attached to trees.So, after a friend suggested he shouldwalk to a tree to find an engineer to fix his faulty air con, and go to more trees to get multiple quotes, Loo decided to create ServisHero. He rallied friends Jason Kang, a classmate at Oxford and ServisHero CFO, and Paul Copplestone, ServisHero CTO, and the startup was born in March 2015. The company raised undisclosed funding from telecom firm YTL, online sales site Lelong.my and an ex-Groupon COO, but this injection announced today will go towards expanding its regional footprint with another launch before the end of the year.Loo told TechCrunch that the service has received over 50,000 downloads to date, and it has over 3,000 service providers on the platform. The most obvious services offered are home services  such as repairs or cleaning  but Loo said ServisHero also covers fitness (personal trainers), drivers, massage/beauty and even accounting and other services for SMEs. The goal, he said, is to provide access to allkinds of local services.Whats particularly interesting about ServisHero  beyond a beautiful app created by Pinterest engineerAdam Burmisteris its monetization model. Service providers buy prepaid credits on the service that will allow them to bid for jobs. No credits means a merchant cant bid and credits dont guarantee a job will be won. That incentives them to keep costs competitive and, because ServisHero isnt taking a cut, theres noadditional pricing layer added on.For consumers, ServisHero recommends leaving each job each job request for 24 hours to check for bids, although Loo said that very often a number of service providers have responded to job postings within hours.For Golden Gate Ventures, this deal marks another large check from its new $50 million fund, and another investment in a startupwith ambitions to scale regionally in Southeast Asia, and perhaps beyond.
