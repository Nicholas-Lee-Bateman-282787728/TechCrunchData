When I was listening to Pharrell and Justin Timberlake (assumedly stoned out of their minds) ramble about the meaning of art with Cara Delevigne on Beats 1 over the weekend, I came to the sudden realization that the product thatI had beenlistening to was the future of Twitter.Apple Music is far from the mostintuitive product Apple has pushed out, but the features theyve finessed that emphasize discovery and live curatedcontent are exactly what Twitter has been missing.The fact that Twitter needs a new way to approach live content shouldnt be a surprise,the company has teased Project Lightning,an upcoming feature that heavily emphasizes events, and investors have called for the deconstruction of the timeline as Twitters central hub.Project Lightning (or Moments) isnt enough. Whats Trending wasnt enough.What Twitter needs is already sitting at the bottom of the Apple Music app, those tabs (specifically Radio and For You) hold the keys to the kingdom for the next iteration of Twitter.What should be terrifyingfor Twitter is that what Apple did for musicwith Beats 1 it could just as easily do for sports or news throughdedicated live channels.One of Twitters most important acquisitions to date has been Periscope. The live video streaming service will surely see its importance grow, but if Twitter wants to grow extensively, they need to own the market for user-generatedand professionally-curated mobile video content.Twitter will either die or fully realize its potential asa massive media empire, it doesnt have other options.If it wants to maintain relevance and attract new users, Twitter needs to utilize its reach to hire actual journalists and celebrities to curate the news of everything inside a separate tab of its app. A 24/7 feed of multimedia content that is heavily crowd-sourcedcan make Twitter the up-to-the-nanosecondnews source with thought leaders offeringcommentaryto the140-character snippets that never end.Beats 1 gives Apple exclusivepersonality from major personalities. This should really be something that Twitter is doingas well, given the devoted, verified presence of such a large swath of pop culture figuresonthe site. Twitter should behosting single-page AMAs inside their appand leveraging their celebrity members in a more visible manner. Periscope and Twitter could alsowork together to birththe live social media talk show and createTwitter celebrities just as Vine has produced its own stars.Producinga live broadcast channel would be a pretty radical move,but Twitter really needs to grow more experimental and ambitious with producing media content and making it attractive.When it comes to feeding me music that Im already interested in, nothing beats the recommendations from Apple Musics For You section. With how Apple is able to put its finger on the pulse of music taste based on a few follows, Twitter should be able to balancemy hundreds of connectionswith global topics and and give me an appealinglist of trending topics specific to me.Lightningis about major events, think the Oscars as a whole. BuzzFeedreportedthat Twitter anticipates posting seven to ten of these events per day.But what I want is a separate tab holding a multitude of snapshots that are varied withmy interests.I want Twitter to adapt to my cultural obsessions.To do this, Twitter is going to have to forego relying oneditor-curated content for this purpose and strengthen their content recommendation engines.For example: There are going to be millions of tweets about who won Best Picture at the Oscars, but if I follow Jessica Chastain extensively and retweeted a certain designers new collection three months ago then I want to see a dedicated story on if shes wearing the dress from that collection and then a seriesof tweets from verified gossip hounds and my friends on whether they think she pulled off the look.Chris Sacca, a notableTwitter investor,wrote apiecedetailing his vision for Twitter and how itshouldnt necessarily confine its various missionsto a single app (think a separate NBA Twitter app).But what I want is for Twitters central app to know my separate interestsand cater to them intelligently. If it knows I have a deep love forthe Warriors and follow all of the teams players and coaching staff, then it should knowthat when theres an important game on, thats all I want to see in this tab.Twitter needs to grow smarter, they have my evolving interests from every follow and retweet I make. For You hosts playlists of oldies and new tunesalike that fit into my evolving tastes based on me just following a few artists.If Twitter can better capitalize on my distinctinterests and curatehow I process the latest happenings accordingly, Im only going to grow more engaged with the app.Twitter is in a pretty crazy position right now.The revolution-enabling microblogging platform just hasnt been all that revolutionary in terms of its own product, and user growth and confidence from wall street have slowed as a result.With a new CEO in the works and a mandate from Wall Street to get its act together and grow its user base, this is the time for Twitter to take risks.Following Apple Musics models of curated and recommended content could be a key for Twitters future success. With it Twitter might be able to soar to new heights and become a truly revolutionary media company.Or, who knows, maybe Apple couldjust buy Twitter.
