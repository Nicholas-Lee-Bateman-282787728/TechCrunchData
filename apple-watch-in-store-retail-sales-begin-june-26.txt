Apple will begin selling some models of the Apple Watch starting in two weeks, according to a press release from the company today. Also, on June 26, wellsee Watches go on sale in seven more countries, includingItaly, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan.All orders for Apple Watch which were placed in May will ship to customers within the next two weeks, too  except for the 42mm Space Black Stainless Steel model, which has so far been the slowest to reach pre-order customers. Apples SVP of Operations Jeff Williams explained in the release that the company is finally making progress through the big backlog of existing orders, which is likely whats paving the way for country expansion and retail availability.The fact that Apple says only some models will be sold in physical retail storelocationsin two weeks indicates we probably wont see that Space Black versionin stock in a couple of weeks, but it will be interesting to see which ones will be available to try on and take home.
