 Heres an embarrassing secret: Before today, Id never made a GIF.I mean, obviously Ive seen them, laughed when theyve been passed along, and made a note so that I could share them myself later. Ive even searched for them once or twice on Giphy.But deep down, I knew I was a fraud, someone who feared the day when an editor would say, Hey, can you whip up a funny GIF about this? and Id have to admit that I didnt have any idea what I was doing.Thats why I breathed a sigh of relief when I learned that Imgur was launching Video to GIF  as the name implies, it allows you to easily convert online videos into GIFs. In fact, the popular image-sharing service describes this as the easiest and fastest way to make awesome GIFs from videos.Since I havent actually created a GIF before (yes, its embarrassing, we discussed this already), I dont know whether this is truly the easiest and fastest method (YouTube, by the way, has also been rolling out its own built-in GIF creator), but it is pretty friendly to neophytes like me. You just enter a video URL, select the portion of the video that you want to convert, add some text, and voila, youve got a GIF a few seconds later.Imgur says the tool is compatible with more than 500 video sites, including YouTube, Vimeo, and Vine. Even I managed to do it. Ill admit I had a brief moment of panic when I got confused by the various markers showing the start, stop, and current play points in the video, but nonetheless, I did it. Even if its a dumb inside joke (borrowed from HBOs Silicon Valley), and even if I havent figured out how to make the text larger, I still feel a ridiculous sense of accomplishment. GIFs, I will never fear you again.And if you werent looking for a new GIF-making tool, its still interesting to see Imgur expand  maybe it can turn lurkers who pop by the site into active posters. In the press release announcing the tool, Director of Product Sam Gerstenzang said the company is democratizing GIF creation for everyone.
