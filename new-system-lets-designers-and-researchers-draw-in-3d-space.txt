A new 3D interactive system created by researchers at the University of Montreal allows designers and builders to draw in scenes in real time. By projecting images on a thin material, the system, called Hyve-3D, allows you to swipe through scenes and make colors and shapes appear on walls and floors. It also allows for multi-user interaction  one designer can sketch some furniture while another can move it around.The system is a bit complex. From the release:In other words, the tablets act as 3D cursors. Your finger can slide through various objects and select them or you can draw right into the scene. While its not true 3D, the system does allow for some optical illusions.The researchers will show off the new technology at the SIGGRAPH 2015 Conference in Los Angeles. No word on whether we will be able to drape a concave fabric screen over our living rooms so we can move IKEA furniture around in real-time in 3D.
