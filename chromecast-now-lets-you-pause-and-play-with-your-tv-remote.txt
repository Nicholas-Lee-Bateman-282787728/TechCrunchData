Googles Chromecast turns the phone in your pocket into a really, really great TV remote  which is great, until your TV remote is nearby, but your phone for some reason isnt.Surprise! Chromecast suddenly lets you pause and un-pause videos with your TVs infrared remote.While it doesnt seem that Google has officially announced the functionality, Ive just tested it myself  and sure enough, it works. Heres an on-the-fly demo:But wait! you say. The Chromecast doesnt have an infrared receiver! How can an infrared remote control it?Its all working through the magic of HDMI-CEC, the same protocol that allows the Chromecast to automatically turn your Smart TV on when its video time.The bad news: that means it wont work with all TVs, though most made within the last few years should be HDMI-CEC enabled. Some TVs sort of hide the protocol to avoid confusing people  so if youre not sure, check your manual. (Oh, and your TVs remote will need a dedicated play/pause button, of course.)The functionality also seems to be enabled on an app-by-app basis. It doesnt work when youre casting from Hulu, for example  but from YouTube? It worked immediately, without me having to change a thing.According to /r/Chromecast, its currently working in HBO Go, WatchESPN, Chromes built-in web player, Allcast, BBC iPlayer, Google Play Music and TuneIn Radio.[via Janko Roettgers]
