Tomorrow marks the kickoff point for the next cycle of tech earnings, so the markets are on the precipice of a data deluge. Today we had a bit of a pre-show, with twothings happening that are well worth our consideration:Boxs big trading day and Twitters fake acquisition news.Up first, Box had a massive day, popping 6.49percent to $18.05per share. The jumpfor Box is likely welcome, as the company is essentially bouncing off of record lows. Shares in the company now value the enterprise file sharing and collaboration company north of $2 billion again. Boxs last private round remains stuck at a premium to its current value.The Box rise is notable for its relative scale, and also for its import inside the mathmagical IPO game. While there are two technology IPOs later this week, the technology flotation game has been as low as the reservoir level here in California so far this year. Having Box decline as it had, before the bump, couldhave pitchedthe proverbial moist covering on investor sentiment.How did Box manage an impressive rally today? Theres this view, at least [authors note: Kill me]:@alex Cramer's impact is amazing. Jason M. Lemkin (@jasonlk) July 14, 2015Moving ahead, Twitter got punkd hard today, after a fake Bloombergclone-site purported to report that the social firmwas neck-deep in negotiation to sell itself for $31 billion. Twitters current market cap rests around the $22 billion mark.Investors were obviously excited by the (fake) news. The stock did this:The false flag rumor was quickly shot down, and the pop dissipated. For Twitters IR team, I donate one beer, to be redeemedat the TechCrunch office, which is just a short walk throughSOMA.All told, after tomorrows regular trading, we are kicking off with Intel and Netflix earnings. Everyone else will follow. If you were looking for a wee flutter, things are now afoot.
