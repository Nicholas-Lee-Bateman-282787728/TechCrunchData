Pouring gason the bonfire of news tech, Google recentlyannounced that ithas distributedmore than 27 million ($30 million) into projects spanning the European news techscene.The funds goal is to help stimulate innovation indigital journalism over the next three years, Googles CEOSundar Pichai said at an event in Paris last week. This batch of project endowmentsis the first from a150 million ($167 million) fund the companyannounced last year.The funding will go to a wide variety of organizations, Pichai said, describing the companies applying for the Digital News Initiative(DNI) funds as wonderfully diverse, ranging from automated content personalization and robot journalism, to hoax-busting apps and tools to verify social media in real-time reporting.Google and European news organizations have had a tense relationship over the past few years, and Google no doubt hopes to mend some bridges with the Digital News Initiative. In Germany, for example, publishers wanted Google to pay for using short snippets of copy on Google News. The spat culminated in Google making inclusion in Google News opt-inand temporarilyde-listing a large number of news organizations in Google News.The new fund is designed to fund projects in three categories, including prototype projects requiring up to 50k ($55k) of funding to build a prototype. In addition, the fund is open to medium projects open to startups and news organizations requiring up to 300k ($333k), and large projects, open to larger organizations with more ambitious goals requiring larger amounts of funding.Another recipient of project funding is the German startup Spectrm. Itwill use the funds tobuild an artificial intelligence engine to help publishers communicate directly with readers via instant messaging apps.The first round of contributionsis distributed across startups in 23 different European countries, with the largest project investments made in Germany, the UK, Spain, France and Belgium.Update: Google does not take an equity stake in the companies or projects involved, and we updated this article to clarify that. In addition, weve updated the link to El Diario, which was pointing to the wrong site.
