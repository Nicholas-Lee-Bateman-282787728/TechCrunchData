Sorry, Android fans. Nintendos next gaming system will not be based on Android. The official word comes from a Nintendo spokesperson speaking to a Japanese report that indicated that the upcoming Nintendo NX would use Android as its operating system.The same report speculated that by using Android, Nintendo would be able to easily lure developers to build games for the NX. Moving to Android didnt seem like an illogical step for Nintendo, which recently (and finally) started embracing mobile gaming. Android gaming has exploded over the last couple of years and seemed like a wise move for Nintendo to embrace, at least in part, the platform. But alas, the report was not true.There is no truth to the report saying that we are planning to adopt Android for NX, a Nintendo spokesman said.There is little known about the NX, but the company could reveal some information at the gaming industrys biggest tradeshow, which is just weeks away. In the past Nintendo has used E3 to announce its latest gaming hardware. The Wii U is getting a tad stale, too. While a full launch announcement for the NX is unlikely, Nintendo will likely say something about its next generation console.
