Apple Music launched. We signed up and used it. The three month trial period is over (depending on the actual date that you signed up), though. You were signed up to auto-renew by default but maybe you want to turn that off like I did.Personally? Im sticking with Spotify and just didnt use Apple Music enough. You can renew manually if you like.Heres how to change your subscription status in iTunes on the desktop (note: if youve already been charged, youll be canceling for next month):Click account info.-Click subscriptions.-Click edit your Apple Music membership.-Set it up however you like.-On iOS, open up the Apple Music app and tap the little face in the top left and manage everything from there:There you have it! More soon on why I decided to stick with Spotify.
