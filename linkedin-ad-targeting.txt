LinkedIn advertisers are getting a new way to target their campaigns specifically, a feature allowing them to aimSponsored InMail and Sponsored Updates towardcompanies where theyre actually trying to make sales.Russell Glass, the head of products for LinkedIn Marketing Solutions, told me that while the network already includes plenty of ad-targeting options, its company-targeting features arent ideal.Basically, if you wanted a campaignto reach people at aspecific organization, it was a fairly manual process and you were limited to a list of 100 companies.Now, with LinkedIn Account Targeting, businesses can bring their own list of accounts (i.e. sales accountscompanies, not individual user accounts). LinkedIn then cross-references that list with the 8 million company pages on the site and creates a usersegment forad targeting. Glass said this can be combined with LinkedIns other targeting features, so marketerscan limit their campaign to, say, specific job titles in specific geographies at a few thousand companies.Second, Glass said that for the last couple of years, his team has been really focused on sponsored content and buildingthat core platform. Next up: A broad set of tools called Audience Matching, which should giveadvertisers more ways to use the data that they already have.This is a platform, he added. Audience Matchingis somethingthat were building to allow us to much more easily take in datasets [from advertisers].  Account targeting rolls out tomorrow, and in the future well be rolling out other datasets.
