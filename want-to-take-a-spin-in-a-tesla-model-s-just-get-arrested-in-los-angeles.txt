If youve dreamt of taking a ride in one of the beautiful Tesla S sedans, you have options. You could go to one of Teslas showrooms and try to take one for a test drive.Or you could get arrested in Los Angeles if you dont mind sitting in the back seat. LAPD introduced one of the all-electric Model Ses (P85D) last week to its fleet. They also have a BMW i3 driving around, too.#LAPD: @LAPDChiefBeck speaking at the news conference on Historic Transition to Green Energy Vehicles. http://t.co/n1KdFOrX8F LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) September 11, 2015The Model S P85D is ridiculously fast (complete with insane mode), so if youre thinking about trying to get into one of those police chases, youre probably not going to win. But if you want to take that free ride, then you probably arent trying to win are you?Dont worry, taxpayers, the Model S is on loan. Good thing, because the base price of the vehicle is $105,000.All kidding aside, its good to see the police force embrace a greener car, since patrolling the streets contributes to the ridiculous amount of grossness in the L.A. atmosphere. Mayor Eric Garcetti says the city plans to lease 160 pure electric vehicles of different makes and models in the future.
