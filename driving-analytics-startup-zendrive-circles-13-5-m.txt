Zendrive, a startup that uses smartphone sensors to measure drivers behavior, has raised $13.5 million in Series A funding led by Sherpa Capital, with participation from Nyca Partners, Thomvest Ventures, and earlier backersFirst Round Capital, BMW i Ventures, Fontinalis Partners.Tad Montross, whos the chairman and CEO ofGeneral Re Corporation, also joined the round.If you havent heard of Zendrive before, the 2.5-year-old, 35-person, San Francisco-based companytargets enterprise customers like on-demand services and trucking companiesthat have large fleets of cars and trucks on the road, charging them licensing fees for its safety insights. (Itssoftware development kitis free for upto four drivers. Between five and 99 drivers, the company charges $4 per driver per month. Beyond 99 drivers, its necessary to call the company for a quote.)Zendrive is hardly alone in offering safety tools to customers in both emerging and established transportation industries. Just one of its competitors is afour-year-old hardware and software company called Automatic that sells what it calls a smart driving assistant. Another flavor of company selling telematics tools and services is 18-year-old Omnitracs, which sells fleet management software.Investors have plainly been won over anyway, including by some of Zendrives new features for making fleets safer at a largescale, like itsAutomatic Collision Detectionfeature.Developed with one of its investors, BMW, and tested atBMWs crash-test facilities, the technologydetects collisions in real time, allowing anycar containinga smartphone to notify a call center or emergency contact, thereby reducing the time required to deliver a first response.Zendrives new funding will be used to double its team by year end, and to hone itstechnology further still.The company will also presumably use the funding to draw a bigger distinction between itself and its direct competitors, many of which are using hardware devices.It argues, for example, that becauseZendrive ismeasuring data on mobile devices versusthe vehicle itself, it willbecome increasinglyrelevant toon-demand services, where there may be more than one driver per vehicle.The company further notesthat on-board diagnostics ports (as employ both Automatic and Omnitracs) have been demonstrated to create security weaknesses that can allow hackers to remotely take control of cars,whilesmartphones dont pose the same kind of cybersecurity threat.Zendrive has now raised $15 million altogether.
