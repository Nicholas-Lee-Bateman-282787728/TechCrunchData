AOL, which is in the process ofgetting acquired by Verizon for $4.4 billion, says it has no plans to divest itself of its content operations (which include TechCrunch) as part of that deal. But its not leaving them on autopilot, either. Weve confirmed there are plansto overhaul MapQuest, its mapping business,later this year.Part of that includes a deal with developer mapping platformstartup Mapbox, which will provide new rendering for MapQuests maps.We were tipped off to changes because of a tweet claimingAOL would be shutting down MapQuests internal mapping capabilities and switching to Mapbox.Then, just earlier today, the Washington Postran a feature on MapQuest that also noted anupcoming overhaul of the product. We understand this product refresh is likely to launch this fall.While we have yet to nail down a lot of the details of how the overhauled MapQuest will look,heres what we know so far: the Mapbox portion of the new service will cover rendering services only. This has led to MapQuesteliminating two positionsfrom its own team. (There has beenat least one other notable departure: Ty Beltramo, who had been theCTO, left this month, although we understand that was a personal, rather than business-related, decision.)The raw data for those maps will continue to come from MapQuests current providers, which include TomTom and OpenStreetMap (both are also used by Apple Maps). MapQuest will continue to retain a team of developers who will create services that use these maps, such as a recent development that lets users of the app summon roadside assistance if their car breaks down.And while the Washington Post article notes that MapQuest is currently profitable, we wouldnt be surprised if we see MapQuest looking to leverage more of the ad-tech side ofAOLs business to further monetize the data that it does pick up from its maps.A source familiar with the matter told us that MapQuest makes the majority of its revenues from B2Bsales, witha couple of thousand customers for itsenterprise services at this stage.It was not that long ago that MapQuest was considered the market leader when it came to online maps. Google Maps finally overtook it in 2009, according to comScore, when it registered 42.2 million monthly users to MapQuests 41.5 million, as Google began to leverage its search engine as a channel for more traffic to its maps above those of other providers.In the last several years, the hugeshift to smartphone and tablet usage, and away from less moveablecomputers, has led to a massiveboost forlocation-based services and the need for good mapping technology to meet consumer demand. Thats given major upliftto appslike Google Maps, whichhelp people use their smartphones as navigation tools.The evolution of connected cars, cloud-based services and new data collection hardware, is opening up a whole new set of ways that maps will be useful and maybe even necessary. Thats onereason why the sale of Nokias Here mapping division seems to be drawing a lot of interest.You could argue that in some ways MapQuest has not capitalised on this boom. TheWashington Post notes that MapQuest now hassome 40 million monthly unique users (for the desktop version of its product)  essentially a decline from the number it had in 2009. But fromwhat we understand from a source, that works out to billions of map views.And interestingly, MapQuest has had some unlikely boosts to its traffic: when Tim Cook, Apples CEO, apologized publicly for some of the teething problems Apple was facing with its first foray into its own maps,MapQuests app was named by him as one alternative for people to use. That led to millions of users who are still using the MapQuest app today.Were in a very tough space, one MapQuest employee told usof the challenge of building a product that can do battle with the likes of Google Maps.The mainreason for the lack of an overhaul of MapQuests product beforenow isdown tolack of resources  with some 100 employees at MapQuest versus(for instance) 6,000 atNokia Here. However, AOL hasevidentlyrevisited MapQuest and decided to reinvest  initiallyputtingmore effort into itsapps and now turning attention to the desktop product in a bid to grow that 40 million MAU figure.AOLbought MapQuest back in1999 for $1.1 billion.
