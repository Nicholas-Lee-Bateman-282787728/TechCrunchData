There isnt a lot of data on the potential of technology in Southeast Asia, which is why many in the industry have been excitedly flipping through a new report released todayby Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek and Google. The biggest takeaway: Southeast Asias internet economy could be surge to be worth a massive $200 billion annually within ten years.The region typically falls into the shadow of Chinas thriving tech space and Indias fast-growing ecosystem, but deals likeAlibabas recent $1 billion investment in Lazada andSoutheast Asiascumulative population of over600 million people areputting it on the map, many just coming into contact with the internet or mobile for the first time. For them, technology promises to be truly transformativeand enabling.Beyond the headline $200 billion stat, the research  pulled together using proprietary data from Google, Temasek insight, interviews with third-parties and othersources gives some color on where the most notabletech verticals maybe by 2025:With 260 million users now and an estimated 480 million by 2020,Southeast Asias is the worlds fastest growing internet market  adding 3.8 million new users a month. Beyond that, its young population (70 percent of which is aged under 40), lack of big box retailers serving entire countries and growing middle classes are forecast to power this surge forward.The report cites plenty of challenges  particularly around techtalent, barriers around payment, inconsistent regional logistics and immature consumer behavior  but Temasek and Google believe that with $40-$50 billion in investment capital, the regions digital economy can take hugestridesoverthe next decade.I fell in love with Southeast Asia when I moved here in 2008, and the potential for technology to make a difference inpeoples daily lives  whether it be e-commerce, online banking or even just keeping in touch with family via messaging and calling apps  is what has kept me here and kept me interested inwatching this great transition unfold.I dont want to cannibalize the report too heavily by republishing the deck extensively, but the slides below are particularly worth poring over.
