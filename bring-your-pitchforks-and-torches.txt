Any press is good press, apparently, as Reddit hit a new 8 billion page view record in July amidst community upheaval over new policies and leadership. Reddit grew from 175 million unique visitors in May to 177 million in June. But as hot takes flew in a media frenzy around volunteers blacking out Subreddits and CEO Ellen Paos departure, Reddits growth spiked in July bringing it to 195 million monthly visitors.Thats an 8.9X increase in its month over month growth rate. And it it puts Reddit at nearly a 100 billion-page view yearly run-rate.There were fears that loyal Redditors might ditch the site after one of the communitys favorite employeesVictoria Taylor was fired, and co-founder Steve Huffman announced stricter content moderation policies after returning to replace former CEO Ellen Pao. So far, Reddit hasnt seen such an exodus.However, its possible that people curious about all the Reddit hubbub might be temporarily padding its numbers, masking the departure of more hardcore users. Well have to see how Reddits numbers fare in August now that the scandal has died down and the new policies have been announced.Its rabid Redditors who browse the site all day that make its advertising model work. Trading those for casual looky-loos who wont come back could cause trouble for the startup. Reddit will also have to deal with lost revenue from its new policy not to earn money off content that violates a common sense of decency.But if it takes breaking a few bigoted eggs to make a morally just omelet, the company and world might be better for it.
