AnalyticsMD, which is launching out of Y Combinators latest batch,is a startup tackling a difficultbut very worthwhile problem: how to boostthe operational efficiency of hospitals and improve patient care by helping staff makebetterchoicesabouthow resources areallocated. Its founders likentheir productto an air traffic controller for the hospital and healthcare system.Their real-time analytics platform predicts changes in demand so that resources such as extra staff andbeds can be brought in before they are needed to prevent scenarios such as emergency room waiting times spiraling outside target limitsorthe quality of patient care suffering. TheHIPAA compliant SaaS software has been rolled out to several paying customers in the U.S. healthcare sector so far, including amajor San Francisco Bay Area hospital system.The key to understanding AnalyticsMDs proposition is thelarge-scale, machine learning prediction engine at the core of their platform, say co-founders Brent Newhouse and Mudit Garg. This ingests a spectrum ofreal-time data signals  from electronic medical records, to staffing systems and outpatient numbers, along with granular on-the-ground signals such as bed sensors and emergency call button data, to external factors gleaned byscraping public data such as weather info, disease seasonality and even local events whichmight have an impact on hospital admissions  looking for patterns to generate its demand predictions.Predicting accidentsthatend up in the ERdoessound a tad oxymoronic butthats exactly the point ofsuch complex, multi-signal AI-powered analytics platforms.The basic concept being: feed the machineenough data and the learning algorithms willfindthe patterns, or at least be able to predict likelihoods with decent accuracy. Sothats what AnalyticsMD says its platform can do  and with a high degree of accuracy.(In testing of its algorithms it says it has measured measuredmid-step accuracy in the 90% rangeof predicting volume a day ahead, or predicting census of a unit a day ahead, althoughGarg stresses its not putting those testfiguresin front of customers.)Thesoftware weighs up demand probabilities and considers the various costs involved, meaning financial costs such as staffing and beds but also care costs, so crucial factors such as quality of service and patient satisfaction, before generating its real-time resource recommendations via a decision layer  known as DecisionOS.Theres always an element of the unknown [when generating predictions] but thats why the final layer that we tack on top of the prediction engine is this decision layer. What its doing is its saying I know historically when I have predicted this is how off I am, and based on that I know what is the cost of being off and what is the benefit of that, and let me optimize my answer based off of that, says Garg.Its a concept borrowed from industrial engineering which is if you think of the prediction not just as saying we think theres going to be exactly 23 patients, not more no less, but instead think of it more as a distribution of predictions we know roughly what the probabilities of being off by a little bit here, a little bit there are, based on how this algorithm has performed in the past. If you have a sense of what that distribution looks like you can make your decision based on [the relative costs], adds Newhouse.If we know historically what the distribution on those predictions looks like you can actually optimize and minimize those costs and pick a decision  even if you dont know the exact number of patients, you can make a decision that balances the trade off of being too conservative or not conservative enough based on those costs.Thispredictive core  they argue  sets theproduct apart from rival software productswhich just plug multipledata signals into a dashboard view for hospital staff to interpret themselves. The problem with the dashboardapproach in healthcareoperations is staff simply dont have time to be triaging all this data themselves.And while AnalyticsMD does offer its own real-time dashboard view too, its added layer ofdata processing helps hospitals achievegreateroperational efficiencies by providing a nudge ahead oftime.Recommendations generated by DecisionOS are delivered to hospital staff aspre-emptivealerts, perhaps sent as amobile text message (as in the below example) or via a phone call to their device. Whateverdevice and medium is most appropriate for reaching that particularhealthcare providers staff.These users are ones that are constantly battling fires that are happening in the hospital and taking care of patients, so to expect them to continuously check a dashboard, make sense of whats going on, see if its causing a problem and happen to see it at the right time and then decide whats the best data-driven decision, based on that, is really hard, saysGarg.We started with [a real-time dashboard]at first and realized that, and then built a whole bunch of statistical intelligence to do; first: automatic detect if there is anything unusual happening and let the hospital know; second: find the root causes, we actually filed some IP on that, to statistically find the root causes, so if an emergency room is backing up is it because we hada lot of patients, is it because they were sick, is it because labs didnt work fast enough, what were the real root causes; and then [DecisionOS]predicts, based on what its seeing  we see 10 patients now in the waiting room, its going to get to 20, to prevent this you need to call a doctor in one hour earlier, or you need to open that bed. And thats been really, really amazing for our customers.The initialapplication targetsfor AnalyticsMDs tech areemergency departments, operating rooms and outpatient capacity. But the team sees scope to expand to fit all sorts of care and clinical operational facilities and needs overtime.Indeed, the platforms recommendations can and are alreadybeing tailored to highly granular, predictive care scenarios  such ashelping to reduce the number of patient falls. Or even to detect which patients may not have had the best service in the hospital.The team claims one early implementation of its platformwas able to cut the number of patient falls inhalf over a 1.5 month period, based on analyzing a combination of data signals such as when a patient presses a call button for help, how long it takes a nurse to respond, what the patient was asking for, how much they were moving around in their bed and so on.Historically we detected patterns to patients that had fallen and used that combination to be able to say who are the patients who are likely to fall.We do use a whole bunch of machine learning algorithms that help take out any unknowns in the equation, addsGarg.Another compelling benefit Newhouse points to of having an analytics platform helping to manage hospital operations, rather thanjust a dashboard  or even a dedicated human team focused on optimizing operational efficiency is that itprovides unbroken continuity between staff changes. So, for instance, a nurse just arriving for a day shift will be automatically in the loopaboutany ongoing issues fromthenight before  because the platform provides the data overlap as humanstaff come and go.But what about the other humans in this equation  the patients? Are they aware of how the things that they do and that happen to them in hospital are now being processed, and how certain actionsmight trigger certain healthcare outcomes? In itscurrent rolloutsGargsaysis only utilizing data elements thathospitals were already capturing, so patients have not been explicitly made aware of this additional, more joined-up layer of data-processing going on around them.I think the patients experience right now is probably one of pleasant surprise when the hospital walks in and says we noticed you may not have got the best service, what can we do to help?. They probably just see the hospital as being a lot more responsive. Without necessarily seeing the tech explicitly, he adds.However he does go on to specifythat if a hospital started asking for additional decisions that maybe required additional dataelements to be captured then the team would definitely want to have a conversation with the patients to make sure they are comfortable with that.Newhouse also points outthat AnalyticsMD makes a point of not capturingpersonal data such as patients names or dates of birth. That was a very conscious decision we made.From an operations perspective that information isnt really needed and why take it if we dont need it?The original conceptfor AnalyticsMD datesback some four or five years, according toGarg, after heand Newhouse (who both have engineering backgrounds) met whileworking in hospitals on operational issues  where they sawhow day to day operational challenges and inefficiencies could impact front-line care. The teams third co-founder,Ian Christopher, brings the algorithmic expertise  having worked on predictive software while at Stanford.A first version of their product was launched two years ago, followed by anMVP ofthe current iteration somesix months ago, and the latestversion, with the DecisionOS layer, landedin December.The startup has raised $720,000 in seed funding so far, with investors including YC and some undisclosed U.S. angels. Given its taking revenue, its not in a position where it needs to raise more funding at this point but the co-founders speculate thatif they convert all the interest they are seeing into paying customers they may look to bring on additional investors to help scale to meet demand.In terms of their next steps, as they graduate from the YC program, they are focusing on thenewly launchedDecisionOS feature  including getting it rolled out to more customers. We are flushing out the delivery mechanism of the DecisionOS and launching it in a 30 hospital system, hopefully soon, in all their emergency rooms. And then a few customers on the operating room side. And then our plan going forward is to mature that DecisionOSAnd take the partners that we have today, many of which are large systems, and expand into all their facilities, says Garg.He adds: Our goal would be to be infairly substantial number of facilities in one geography, at least where we can start proving what the gross facility benefits are  for example picking out flu trends before they happen, picking out new diseases as theyre coming to the areaso we can start helping different systems which have silos of data derive benefit from each other as well.
