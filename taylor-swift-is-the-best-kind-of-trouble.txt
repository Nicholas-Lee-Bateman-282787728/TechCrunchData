Once in a while (a lot, actually), part-time Apple blogger and musician Taylor Swift likes to give to a charitable cause. She likes hanging out with kids who are in the hospital, too. She likes disrupting technology the most.Swifts most recent disruptive move was a donation made to a little girl named Naomi, who is kicking the crap out of cancer. It was for $50k, to help with some medical costs that insurance wasnt picking up, through the site GoFundMe. Only problem was that GoFundMe never thought anyone would donate over $15k at once, so it took a bit of rejiggering to allow Swift to make her donation:Taylor Swifts donation was so generous that it required us to increase the donation limit on the platform, said Rob Solomon, GoFundMe CEO. GoFundMes previous donation limit was set at $15,000, but has now been increased to $50,000. There are never any limits on how much a campaign can raise.Heres Naomis awesome reaction to Swifts kind donation:Tay-tay can also add this feather in her tech disruption cap: shes now the highest single donator in GoFundMes history.Theres a lesson to be learned here: startups, dont limit yourself like GoFundMe didyou never know whos lurking. A lot of the time when youre building something you set up fake walls or confines that limit you. These lanes that you stay in for no particular reason could stunt your growth before it ever even happens. You might think Well never hit this limit or Well never need to do that but the reality is if youre successful, you more than likely will.I mean, Taylor Swift made Apple change its business model for streaming music in the span of 12 hours with a Tumblr post, so shoot scale for the stars.
