How would you feel if a robot asked you to touch its butt? Maybe it sounds like a silly question (actually, theres no maybe about it), but as robots proliferate and anthropomorphize, its actually something that needs to be considered. So scientists at Stanford considered it.The study, to be presented soon but previewed by IEEE Spectrum, is entitled Touching a Mechanical Body: Tactile Contact With Intimate Parts of a Human-Shaped Robot is Physiologically Arousing  and really, the title says it all. Though it should be noted that arousing only indicates agenerally heightened state of awareness or attention.When asked to touch high accessibility areas  places we normally touch on other people, like shoulders and elbows  volunteers did so without hesitation or agitation. But low accessibility areas  this would be the robots butt and where its junk would be  produced delay and that arousal we talked about. You really ought to watch the video:Its not that robots are going to start propositioning humans and making them uncomfortable, but this is the kind of thing that must be taken into account when designing an interface  in this case, the robot itself, its gestures and posture.A robot isnt a person, but because its shaped like one and designed to act and speak like one, we imbue it with a sort of temporary humanity when we interact with it. Phones dont look like people, so they dont have butts, or if they do, no one seems to care that were touching them all the time (HTC phones used to have chins, though). But I personally guarantee you will bump into a robot and find yourself saying excuse me some time in the next decade. Several of you have probably already apologized to the Roomba after stepping on it.The paper, by Jamy Li, Wendy Ju and Byron Reeves, will be presented at the International Communication Associations Annual Conference in June.
