Remember Carrier iQ? In the yearsbefore Edward Snowdens revelations about the NSA, the name and its software became synonymous with creepy, unseenmonitoring of everything that you do on a smartphone on behalf of carriers and phone makers  allegedly in the name of better user experience.Now the company appears to be no longer.TechCrunch has confirmed that AT&T has acquired certain software assets from Carrier iQ, along with some staff. The site itself and the wider company, it seems  has gone offline.Weve acquired the rights to Carrier iQs software, and some CIQ employees moved to AT&T, an AT&T spokesperson tells us. AT&Tsigned on as a customeryears ago to use the CIQ software across phones on its network to troubleshoot wireless qualityfor its customers, and the spokesperson went on to explain that this still the case.We useCIQ software solely to improve the customers network and wireless service experience. This is in line with our Privacy Policy and provides a great benefit to users of our network.Wed first heard about Carrier iQ getting sold through a tip, noting twohigh profile companies involved with the purchase. Light Reading, which also reported the AT&T part of the sale, reported that Nielsen was involved in the acquisition.However, a source at Nielsen, when asked about the acquisition, said, I am not aware of anything. A separate person noted that Nielsen will actually now be licensing specific CIQ technology from AT&T.We have contacted Nielsen to see if it would provide a more definitive answer on the record.Like AT&T, Nielsen hadbeen working with Carrier iQ for years already.In its case, Nielsen appears to link into the CIQ software also to measure network performance as it relates to services and ads.Other named customers and partners of Carrier iQ include Ericsson, IBM, Symphony Teleca and Teradata. Other carriers that use its software include T-Mobile.Terms of both parts of the deal  AT&T acquisition of some assets and the Nielsen licensing  are not being disclosed.Carrier iQ controversially rose to prominence back in 2011 after a developer dug up and demonstrated how CIQ code on installed on smartphones ultimately covering some 150 million handsets(this was in 2011)  was trackingdifferent aspects of how people were using their devices.The list was described by aCarrier iQ executiveas a treasure trove andincludedlogging web usage, when and where you are making calls and sending texts (and to whom), app usage, battery life and more  but not every keystroke, as some had claimed.Knowledge of whatCIQ software tracked unbeknownst to the average user clearly hit a nerve with apublic already skeptical about how private information isregarded by large corporations and other organizations for their own purposes a themeamplified in the years to come through the revelations about theNSA and other government groups spying, poor handling of data in corporate databreaches and user tracking for commercial purposes.And so, unsurprisingly, following the revelations, there was a windfall of announcements about which companies wereusing it (and were not using it)to collect information; lawsuits over privacy violations and legislation drafted to tighten controls for the future.Some of thoseclass-action suits, it appears, have been settled. AsAT&T did not acquire the full company, we understand that it will not be liable forany outstanding litigation or settlements against CIQ.
