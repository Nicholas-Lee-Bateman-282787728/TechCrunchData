Jeff Schumacheristhe CEO of BCG Digital Ventures, a low-flying, two-year-old corporate venture group created by Boston Consulting Group and staffed, interestingly, withsome former execs of BCG competitor Booz Allen. (Schumacher is himself a former Booz Allen managing director; he also spent six years with McKinsey & Co.)Though the unit is seemingly late to the corporate venture game  corporate VC represented around 20 percent of all invested capital last year Schumacher suggested toTechCrunch editor-at-large Mike Butcher earlier today that BCGs timing is actually pretty great. We grow by acquiring a lot of broken startups and [can] provide an exit for them that they otherwise wouldnt have. Added Schumacher, who is based in Manhattan Beach, Calif., Im starting to get a lot of calls already.You can see their quick chat, at our temporary studio in Davos, here:
