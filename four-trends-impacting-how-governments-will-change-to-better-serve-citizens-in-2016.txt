Maury Blackman is the CEO of Accela.In 2015, civic technology investment and activity piqued the interest of investors, analysts and app developers as an industry growth segment ripe for disruption and opportunity. A couple of examples: Andreessen Horowitzinvested$15 million in OpenGov, which later received an additional $25 million from other investors; Sapphire Ventures invested $30 million in Socrata; and JP Morgan Private Equity invested $143 million in Accela.Not only havecitizensbecome savvy to how servicesshouldbe delivered, they are increasingly demanding a consistently convenient, openly transparent view into their local government. Innovators such as Amazon, Facebook and Uber have dramatically changed citizen expectations, and the leaders in government are turning to new civic technology tochangethe landscape.As we look toward2016, I seefourmajortrendsimpactinghowgovernmentswillmodernize services, communicate more effectively withcitizensand make engagement with civic processes easy.Governmentsof all sizes are embarking on a multi-year, and in some cases a multi-decade, push to modernize their IT infrastructure. IDCpredictedthat, by the end of 2015, U.S. and local government IT spendingwilltopple $6.4 billion for civic tech. The final numbers arent in yet, but Id venture to say we got close.In 2015, we really saw dramatic shifts on governments willingness to implement cloud technology. Cloud technology is not only saving budgets, its also enabling governmentsto move faster and be more flexible.Moving into2016, wewillcontinue to see transformational shifts in efficiency and effectiveness in which government agencieswillintroduce a cloud-based digital strategy and move away from their traditional towered approach to IT.Investment in IT infrastructure and civic tech is showing no signs of slowing down, and the upward trajectory should continue in2016as citizen-facing software and services that connectcitizens, tourists and businesses with government services continue to grow. A proactive government is able to react tocitizens life events without being prompted. This could be facilitated by the provision of data from third-parties or by proactively providing services based on available data.Wewillsee more government agencies push new engagement boundaries andembrace an entrepreneurial spiritinstead of waiting forcitizensto come to them. Conducting online surveys, interacting through social media, streaming video of public meetings on the Internet and publishing relevant documents or meeting minutes on an online portal are all ways cities willimprove citizen trust and transparency, keepingcitizensup to date and involved.Yelp, for example, does a great job of helping us find restaurants and share experiences with the menu. Governmentsalso visit restaurants, ensuring that citizen expectation for food handling and sanitation are being met.Today, many health departments are providing feeds to Yelp and others so thatcitizenshave these reports at their fingertips.Currently, only11 percentof Americans believegovernmentseffectively share data with the public. However, 33 percent of government agencies have anopen data policy enterprise-wide or for at least one department. In this day and age,citizensfeel all data concerning civic matters should be readily accessible and consumable, so these info-savvy individuals are pushing localgovernmentsto open their data ports and let them in.Throughout next year, government agencieswillnot only start exploring the possibilities oftech, butalso will beginimplementing initiatives to become a connected government thatwillhave far-reaching impacts on both businesses and personal lives.Competing to build innovative and sustainable smart cities, localgovernmentswillrepresent more than25 percent of all government external spendingto deploy, manage and realize the business value of the IoT by 2018. Smart-city plans in several jurisdictions aim at exploring the ability to process huge amounts of data coming from devices such as video cameras, parking sensors, air quality monitors and so forth to help localgovernmentsachieve goals in terms of increased public safety, improved environment andbetterquality of life.The 1.7 trillion construction industry needs more visibility into municipal building and planning departments. Its fast paced, competitive and dependent on detailed coordination. By bringing on tech that connects architects, engineers and contractors to their municipalities, governments have the opportunity to move the needle on GDP in their regions.Analysts believe thiswillgenerate massive new business for technology companies, with revenue for companies investing in smart-city technologies expected to jump to$27.5 billion by 2023 from $8.8 billion in 2014, according to Navigant Research.Governmentagencies are ready to start tapping into the potential of IoT technology, andwillbegin by identifying specific automated actions that might help solve concrete problems. For example, byequipping street lights with sensors and connecting them to the network, cities can dim lights to save energy, only bringing them to full capacity when the sensors detect motion. This can reduce energy costs by 70-80 percent.Consolidation of government services is starting to emerge across the country as a means to provide services more efficiently andimprove the quality and type of services that individual units of government may not be able to offer on their own; wewillsee this trend continue to grow. The potential value of the sharing economywilltotal$335 billion by 2025, according to PwC.Collaboration enables public agencies to move away from their traditional approach to IT and increasingly make use of shared and compostable services offered by a common usually a virtualized, cloud-enabled platform. This leads to more efficient use of development resources, platforms and IT support.We are seeing examples of this already in a new service calledMuniRent, which lets local municipalities rent equipment to one another, and may potentially bestow the same convenience and cost efficiencies realized by consumers of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb.In addition, multiple state agencies are also starting to embrace the gov sharing economy, including Oregon, where the state created a voluntary, statewide ePermitting System on a single platform and is now sharing this platform with more than 20 separate jurisdictions.As the year ahead unfolds, one thing is certain:2016willbe a year of leaps forward in the civic technology industry, offering tremendous upside forgovernmentsandcitizensalike. With the days of paper processes and standing in line for services on the way out, innovation and efficiency are being ushered in. Lets meet here again next year and see how we did.
