Line, the messaging upstartout of Japan, is adding group calling into its ever-expanding webof services. Popcorn Buzz, as the app is called, is entering a crowded market for group calling services  they include dozens of conference calling businesses, along with Skype, Google, Kakao Talk and more. The twist (or gimmick, if youre a bit more cynical) here is that the service is totally free, and lets you add up to 200 people to the call.(Thats in contrast even to Lines own voice service, Line Call, which is cheap but not free to use. Line also offers free calls to other Line users in the mainapp.)The service is live now on Androidglobally, with an iOS app to come soon. Also soon to come will be groupvideo chat andthe ability to talk with a pre-setLINE chat group.While much of what Line has launched to date has been squarely aimed at the consumer market, it seems to be pitching this to would-be business users as well.Popcorn Buzz can be used to talk with friends and family, catch up with classmates, make plans with club members, and more. On top of that, Popcorn Buzz is a perfect replacement for existing paid business-grade conference call services, the company notes. Popcorn Buzz accommodates both personal and business usage, all for free.(Its not specified but for business users contemplating this service, I have a feeling that Line will notbe adding a quality ofservice assurance on those 200-person calls.)Line  with 205million users and a heavy concentration in its home market of Japan along with a handful of other countries in Asia  trails behind other messaging services like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger in terms of size, but it has been trying to make up for it by expanding in to many different features beyond basic messaging.While you have to register with Line to initiate a call, you can then share a call with Line and non-Line users by way of a URL. Those who are already on Line can sync up their Line contacts within Popcorn Buzz.As with other group calling services like Uber Conference and others, whenever a participant talks his or her icon will light up.Languages for this release includeArabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, and Vietnamese.
