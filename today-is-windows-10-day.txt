Ok, the new code is out for the first wave, and you are curious about Windows 10. Or at least we hope so, since we made you a video to go over the broad points of the new operating system from Microsoft.For a more scribbled-down-and-pedantic version of the above video, TechCrunch has you covered as well.Oddly enough, Microsoft is leading the current technology media cycle. That doesnt happen too often. But, I submit to you the current Techmeme setup:As weve noted before, we are now in a new section of the Windows 10 story. Can Microsoft hit its goal of a billion devices in just a few years? And if it can, how fast? And if it cant, how much longer will it take? Well know soon enough.For now, let us know in the comments if you are switching over to Windows 10, and why.
