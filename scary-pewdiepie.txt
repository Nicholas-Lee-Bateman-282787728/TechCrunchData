YouTube willpremiere its first original movies and series for YouTube Red on February 10.The main draws behind YouTube Red  the sites recently launched subscription service  were always ad-free viewing and the promise of original content. Until now, though, there was no original content, so if you subscribed to Red, you basically paid Google $9.99 to remove ads (and maybe offline viewing).Starting next week, though, YouTube Red Will also finally feature its first three exclusive movies, as well as a new series by ubiquitous Scandinavian vlogger PewDiePie.Here are YouTubes descriptions of those new movies and shows:The diverse, dynamic creators behind these films have already built massive audiences on YouTube, rivaling many cable shows, the YouTube team writes in todays announcement. With YouTube Red Originals, we want to help them tell bigger and bolder stories that delight you, their fans. YouTube Red is your opportunity to support the passion projects your favorite creators have only dreamed about until now.Google has yet to disclose how many people have signed up for YouTube Red. PewDiePie alone has over 41 million YouTube subscribers, though, and chances are that some of these will subscribe toYouTube Red just tosee more of him (or they will all hate him for selling out  its kind of hard to say with this demographic).YouTube says it will bring more content to Redlater this year.
