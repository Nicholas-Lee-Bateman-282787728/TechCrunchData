Look at that face.The problem with Facebook isnt the amount of pictures of dogs, its the lack of pictures by dogs. Finally someone is addressing this scourge  unfortunately, its an ad agency. So this isnt a sponsored post, but it may as well be.The Posting Tail is a ridiculous prototype device created by Saatchi & Saatchi Madrid for Pedigree. A Raspberry Pi monitors a tail sensor, waiting for excited wags  which it can, the creators claim, tell apart from ordinary wags. When it detects one, a camera mounted on the stable croup area on the back half of the dog (look it up) takes a picture and immediately uploads it to Facebook via an attached mobile data dongle.Youll probably want to create a new account for your dog, or page anyhow, since dogs arent technically human. On the plus side, the new Monkey Selfie precedent means that dogs cant participate in the copyright process, leaving any viral earnings to you.As much in jest as this product may be, it actually seems like something many pet owners would love  pet wearable companies are already being purchased for nine figures, and devices like the Petcube are likewise gaining popularity. A social media platform actually mounted on a dog is surely the next step. At least its the step we deserve.Please, tell Pedigree to make this gloriously dumb idea a real product.
