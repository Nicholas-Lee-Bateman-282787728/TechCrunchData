After crowdfundingaminimaliste-paper smartwatchlast year, another Sony-backed special project is currently passing a donationsbowl around on Indiegogo  as the electronics giant continues to try to nurturenew ideas via an internal seed acceleration program. And by allowing theemployees working on these internal projectsto seekexternal crowd-support for their ideas.This latest Sony-backed project, Mesh, has raised almost $22,000 so far  just under half itscrowdfundingtarget  for a DIY sensor platform designed to let people create their own connected devices by usinga series of Bluetoothsensors which talk wirelessly to an iPad app where their function isconfigured via a drag and drop interface.The initial hardware Mesh sensors, called Tags, will include anLED light, a motion-detecting sensor, a wireless button and a GPIO Tag for developers/advanced uses whichincludesdigital and analog input/output toconnect other sensors or actuators such as light sensors, motors etc.There are also software Tags within the Mesh companion app that can be incorporated into the mix, to  for instance  incorporatealerts based on weather services, or plug inspecific tablet hardware such as the camera, microphone or speaker to the connected project.Mesh Tags are connected and configured via a companion iPadapp with a simplified interface, aiming to make creating connected projects accessible to non-engineers.There is also a Mesh SDK so that developers can create their own software Tags to work with the Mesh hardware if they want to build more advanced custom projects.What kind of connected projects couldMesh users create? The team offer examples such as a photo capture system that is triggered when a door is opened to snap startled selfies, or a notification sent when an particular item is picked up. Or Tags augmenting physical games with sound effects generated by movements. And so on. The idea being that Mesh Tags can be combined in multiple ways to support lots of different connected project concepts.If they hit their funding, the team say they plan toship Mesh kits to the U.S. and Japan, initially, in May. A basic kit starts at $105 to Indiegogo backers, or the GPIO Tag can be bought on its own for $55.Theconcept is cute enough, albeit notoriginal  its treading similar ground to the likes ofthe SAM wireless sensor kit, or on the developer-focused siderelayrs WunderBaror the health- and fitness-focusedBITalino. But whats mostinteresting here is the sight ofa consumer electronics giants turning to crowdfunding andstartup-style interiororganization to tryto rekindle itscreative mojo.The team behind Mesh notes on its Indiegogo campaign page that it is a small team of passionate engineers at Sonys seed acceleration program.Sony formed a new business unit focused on fast-tracking newprojects that dont fit the mould of its existing businesses last year, according to Bloomberg.This new division includes itsseed acceleration program which allows existing employees with entrepreneurial ideas to pitch for venture funding fromSony. The first batch of pitches was held in June, according to the news agency.Mesh has evidently made it through the first wave of Sonysinternal pitching process and through product prototyping to the point where the team expresses confidence in itsability to manufacture and deliver the product in the first half of this year  assuming, that is, they raise their targeted $50,000 in crowdfunds. They have 53 days left to pull in the fullfunds.With the Sony brand behind them, they are obviously able to present a more reassuring pitch than the average crowdfunding campaign can, noting that: Sonys world leading manufacturing and quality control resources stand behind this project, and telling supporters that: We can assure the manufacture and delivery of MESHOur team will use the resources of Sony to manufacture and deliver your order.On the flip side, you could questionwhy a project backed by a multinational consumer electronics corporation needs to raise donations from web users, given those aforementioned sizable corporate resources. Thats really a sign of ourcrowd-hyped times. And a measure of Sonys own relatively downbeat fortunes as it looks to transform its business to better compete with rivals such as Apple and Samsung.Crowdfunding is used bystartups to build community and generate marketing around a potential product idea, rather than simply just to raisecapital. Its also a great way for makers to glean free feedback  and that sort of crowdsourced product development and intel is the real goldmine for Sony here as it seeks to reset its internal product compass.We would love to hear any feedback from you on how to make MESH even better.We want to see what you will create! the team adds.So this is not about turning any single startup idea like Meshinto a gigantic business, but a gigantic business learning how to come up with lots of new, promising ideas.
