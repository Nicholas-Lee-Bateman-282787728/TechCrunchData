Classically trained composer, multi-instrumentalist and singer Imogen Heap recently made the headlines for releasing her song Tiny Human using blockchain technology. Heap is one of a number of artists exploring the blockchain to launch and distribute music, given its ability to record all transactions and maintain a permanent database to potentially track royalties and plays.For her music, Heap is known for drawing on sources ranging from cardboard tubes to cheap samplers to all manner of new technology.
