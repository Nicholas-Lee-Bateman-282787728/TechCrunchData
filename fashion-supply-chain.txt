Everyone at this point knows that the general supply chain that serves the fashion industry is a nightmare. It was only alittle over two years ago thatthe collapse of the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh killed over 1,200 peopleand forced big fashion brandsto confront the dirty secrets of the awful practices of theirsuppliers yet again.It was in this context, amida growing push for greater oversight and an increasingnumber of startup fashion brandscatering to this sustainable sensibility, that Jag Gill began working onSundar, which offers a new way for designers to source materials for clothes.Now, with $1.3 million in funding led by New Enterprise Associates and participation from Techstars Ventures, Correlation Ventures and undisclosed angel investors, the company is readying itself for a launch in the spring of 2016.The companys technology links a curated selection of textile mills and materials suppliers with clothing manufacturers, brands and designers to ensure the quality and transparency of its supply chain.The company has its roots Boston, but began bearing fruit when Gill hooked up with the New York fashion world.Gill began working on the project in Boston at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the company was incubated at Techstars, but it took flight through its connections withthe New York Fashion Tech Lab, a two-year-old program sponsored by companies like Coach, Kate Spade, and Macys that connects entrepreneurs with industry insiders.Sundar brings the kind of meaningful step change to an industry that excites us as investors, said Ravi Viswanathan, General Partner at NEA, in a statement. Whether its giving family-run luxury suppliers in Italy the ability to scale up with new buyers; or helping mass-market fashion manufacturers diversify their supply relationships, Sundar removes the inefficiencies that characterize sourcing today.Were building a web application for both buyers and sellers, says Gill. So far,we had a private beta where we got the market validation and traction that we needed to get the interest of investors.Using Sundar buyers can source and buy textiles through the app. And its a step up from the current process, which Gill, rightly, calls arcane.The company is currently working with under 100 suppliers and has focused on Italy and India as its first markets.Weve done the first iteration of the product and weve leveraged our on-the-ground relationships in these regions with people who are highly skilled designers, says Gill. And unlike other platforms that focus on a particular material, Sundar will run the gamut to meet all of a designers needs, she says.Other platforms just focus on textiles, says Gill.Were going to focus on the fabrications, textiles, trims, accessories and components.
