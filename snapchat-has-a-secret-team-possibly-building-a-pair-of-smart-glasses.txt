Snapchat has been known for some bold (and perplexing) moves in regards to content features, attempting to revamp event marketing through Stories, redefine journalism through Discover and rethink the selfie through Lenses. Theyve tackled software features, but nowthey may be looking to master hardware.When youre valued at $16 billion why not?A report from CNET details a crop of hirings from major augmented reality groups like Microsofts HoloLens, PTCs (formerly Qualcomms) Vuforia and eye-tracking tech maker Eyefluence that point to Snapchats possible development of a pair of smart glasses.The company showed interest in augmented reality during the last hypewave surrounding Google Glass. Vergence Labs, which produced a pair of glasses equipped with an embedded camera, was acquired by Snapchat for $15 million in Marchof 2014. The acquisition accompanied a larger $50 million acquisition of Scan.me, a QR code-scanning/creating technology that would later manifest itself it the companys Snaptagsfeature.Snapchat did not openly advertise theseacquisitions then, details of it were leaked in the Sony data hack in December of 2014. It was an especially odd-sounding movethen, but fast-forward a couple of years past the acquisitions and the company has added a few billion dollars to its valuation, as well as a variety of mainstay features like its Discover tab and geofilters.Vergence Labs camera-equipped Epiphany EyewearThe real question is whether Snapchat is using these hires toattempt to learn more about augmented reality tech andmore effectively adapt its platform for usage on smart glasses or whether the engineering folk are actually just building glasses with the goal of a consumer release.Sophisticated consumer gadgets might make zero sense for Snapchat at the moment, as their current consumer products include a beach towel, a deck of playing cards and a backpack. Admittedly, for most people, Snapchat in itself makes zero sense,so this could perhaps be very on-brand for them.That being said, Iddefinitely suspect the company is focusing more on looking at technologies to more effectively optimize AR technology for its apps. The employeefrom Eyefluence (who recently left)in particular is interesting as theeye-trackingcompany focuses heavily on engineering more intuitive interface gestures.In an interview with Forbes in January 2014 (just a couple of months before the Vergence Labs purchase),Thomas Laffont, the managing director of Coatue (which led Snapchats $50 million Series C), spoke a bit about the platforms relationship with interfaces on AR devices.People havent thought about use cases on new computing platforms, said Laffont. In one tap you take a photo, one more and you can share it. Imagine [the difficulty] trying to post on Instagram from a Google Glass device.Input for augmented reality is kind of a shit show right now, with most companies experimenting with a wide variety of hand-tracking, eye-tracking, motion-tracking and head-tracking tech to control their devices. If Snapchat can use their AR-minded team to make advances in furthering the ease of content absorption onthe platform, there would be some obvious benefits to the company moving forward.
