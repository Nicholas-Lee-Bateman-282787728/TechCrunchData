Verizon, aka the ownerofTechCrunchs owner AOL,willbe plugging its user trackingad networkinto AOLs online activity tracking advertising network next month, combining its user demographic datawith AOLs intel onbrowsing and app usage habits  with the aim of enhancing their combinedad targeting smarts.Verizon stumped up $4.4 billion to buyAOLearlier this year in a move widely seen to be about enhancingtheir respective ad infrastructures by combining the user tracking and ad targeting technologieseach had been building. So no surprises thats exactly what thepair aredoing now.While  at the time of the acquisition  itwas less immediately clear why Verizon might want AOLs portfolio of content properties, looked at froman ad techperspective, the HuffPo et alcould be seen asa valuable fig leaf atop increasingly invasive ad targeting practices.Verizon details the forthcoming AOL ad network mind-meld in a privacynotice toits advertising programs,spotted by ProPublica yesterday. Here Verizonnotesthatfree services such as The Huffington Post and MapQuest are made possible by advertising  anemollientreminder theres no such thing as a free lunch online. And thattracking for ad profiling purposes is of course the price of using these free services.So theres your fig leaf.Verizonwrites:As you may have heard, AOL recently became part of Verizon. We are providing you this notice to explain how Verizon and AOL will work together, and how this combination will help us deliver services that are more personalized and useful to you.The Verizon family of companies offers a wide and growing variety of free services, including The Huffington Post, MapQuest, and our new mobile video service, go90. Like many others online, these services are made possible by advertising. The best advertising is for something you might actually want, and that is what we want to give you.To help make this happen, starting in November, we will combine Verizons existing advertising programsRelevant Mobile Advertising and Verizon Selects into the AOL Advertising Network. The combination will help make the ads you see more valuable across the different devices and services you use.After the soft soap, Verizon gets a little more specific aboutwhat this means noting that its ad programs mostly gather (and acquire) demographic data on users, while AOLs Advertising Network tracksbrowsing data, app usage and location. Ergo, combine the two, and the result is a more penetratingad infrastructure with greater visibility ofthe peopleits stalking around the Internet to serve with custom ads.Verizon uses what it calls a unique identifier header to track users  whichhas previously been dubbed a zombie cookie or supercookie given it can be used to respawn trackers even when web users opt out of being tracked and/or delete tracking cookies while AOL uses browser cookies to keep tabs on what web and mobile users do. Other trackers usedby both include ad IDs from Apple and Google, according to Verizon.Once the Verizon/AOL adprograms are combined and synced Verizon notes that its identifier will be inserted into certain web traffic sent to Verizon companies (includingAOL) and to certain partners with the result being:While ad techexecs at Verizon and AOL will doubtless be salivating overthe increased user insight derived from the combination of two massive user tracking ad-targeting operations, privacy loving web usersnot so much.And, arguably, its exactly suchprivacy-eroding moves bythe online ad industry that have beenfueling growth in tracker- and ad-blocking software by web and mobile users  which in turn causes problems for online media businesses ad-supported models. And so the digital arms race of pro- and anti-privacy techs continues.Of course plenty ofsharing of intelon web users and their web usage already goes on within the ad industry  often lurking unspecified behind bland descriptors inprivacy policies that might vaguely refer to data-sharing agreements with third party providers  so Verizon-AOL is by no means the only game in town. But this particular linking and syncing of ad-targeting data carriesa $4.4 billion price-tag, whichgives some measure of the utility the pair expect to get.Its worth noting that although Verizon default opts users into its tracking program, it does providean opt out  although this requires users to either to log in to their MyVerizon account, and visit theyour privacy choices page, or to call the company (on1.866.211.0874) to ask to be opted out.AOL also offers someopt out options forits interest-based ad program  detailed here although the process of opting out of its tracking techs isa convoluted one, given itcan require users to re-opt out if they clear their cookies or use a different browser.Indeed,Verizon itself notes that using browser controls such as clearing cookies on your devices or clearing your browser history is not an effective way to opt out of the Verizon or AOL advertising programs. But youd expectthe company that spawned the zombie cookie to provide thatcaveat.
