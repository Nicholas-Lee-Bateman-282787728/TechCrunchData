For the first time, Apple is live streaming the WWDC Keynote (as well as more than 30 different developer sessions). And to open up the conference with a little style, the company tapped comedian Bill Hader to star in a fun introduction video.In true Apple style, most of the companys press/developer conferences lean toward minimalism. Apple executives stand in pretty simple clothes, on a simple stage, adorned only with Apple products and a few large screens.With the video, WWDC is re-imagined as a Broadway-style spectacle. Until, of course, everything falls apart and the show is reduced back down to a laptop and a bottle of water.Enjoy![via BuzzFeedTech]
