If youre a frequent flyer over here in TechCrunch airspace, then you know that there is an upcoming Meetup + Pitch-off going down in NYC in but four short days. Ten companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their wares to a panel of expert judges and a ready-and-waiting audience in a fight to win the opportunity to attend TC Disrupt SF in September. Weve been holding out on telling you who to expect, but no longer. Without any further ado, Im proud to announce the companies participating in the TC Meetup + Pitch-off in NYC on Tuesday at Le Poisson Rouge.The TC Meetup + Pitch-off is not only an opportunity for these fine companies to show off their stuff, but a chance for the NY tech scene to come together over a few drinks (21+ only, please) and get to know each other. So dont wait! Buy tickets now. Doors open at 6pm. Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
