Doodle makes it easy to schedule things with friends, coworkers, whoever  but scheduling isnt the only thing that you need to organize an event. So the company has also connected its tools tothe invitation process, byrolling out an integration withPaperless Post.Doodle CEO Michael Brecht said this is the Zurich-headquartered companys first big US partnership, and one that could introduce the scheduling service to many new users.For those of you who havent used it, Doodle is the most dead-simple service Ive seenfor coordinating schedules.Brecht suggested that easy scheduling could be a big help for some Paperless Post users who want to send out invitations but havent quite locked down a date or time.Theres a kind of lag time where people want to send their cards out but need to set the date first, he said. Now they can shorten this gap, thanks to Doodle.The integration works in both directions, he added  you can schedule something on Doodle and then send an invitation via Paperless Post, or you can can send out a Paperless Post invite that includes a link to a Doodle poll.And youcan poll attendees about non-schedule-related issues, like the venue of an event or the food that youll serve.Our purpose is to help people connect in the real world and we believe that our partnership with Doodle will allow that to happen more efficiently and more often, said Paperless Post CEO James Hirschfeld in an emailed statement.My aim is to see Doodle as the functionality for any site to help  bring groups of people together, he said.And while this new integration might highlight Doodles social utility, Brecht also sees it as a productivity tool. In fact, he just released The Productivity Book, an e-book compiling tips from 30 productivity experts.
