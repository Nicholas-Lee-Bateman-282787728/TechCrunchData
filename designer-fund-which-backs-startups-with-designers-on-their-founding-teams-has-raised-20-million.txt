Designer Fund, a San Franciscooutfit that looks to invest in seed-stagestartups that featuredesigners on their founding teams, has raised $20 million in funding from unnamed individual investors, most of them successful designers looking to support the next generation.The four-year-old firm was founded by Enrique Allen and Ben Blumenfeld, who remain its only general partners. Previously, Allen was a designer at 500 Startups and Facebooks fbFund; Blumenfeld was meanwhile a design lead at Facebook for more than five years.The two met at the Stanford Persuasive Tech Lab, which studies how computer design can change human behavior. When Blumenfeld left Facebook to take a sabbatical, thetwo decided to form Designer Fund.We saw alack of capital that really understood and valued design at the early stages, explains Allen, who notesthat Airbnbs founders werent taken seriously at first because few understoodhow twodesign students could rethink and expand the travel market.Enter Designer Fund, which began largely as the angel fund of Allen and Blumenfeld and has now raised outside capital to provide to companies in chunks of between $250,000 to $1 million. (We thought that rather than writing $50,000 checks and rallying our friends around certain companies, it made more sense to pool our money, Allen explains.)Investors have reason to be optimistic about the effort. Among the companies the duo has backed previously arethe payments infrastructure company Stripe;the payroll service Gusto;the online behavioral health coaching companyOmada Health;and AltSchool, agrowing network of non-profit schools led by former Googler Max Ventilla.All have raised significant amounts of money and remain highly valued as privately held companies.Designer Fundsnewest bets sound interesting, too. Among them isAND CO, a company whose app helps freelancers manage their workflow (we featured it in TechCrunch last month),and Framer, whose design tools helps users create prototypes in new ways.None of Designer Funds bets have led to an exit just yet, so its a little soon to guess at its odds of success.Still, Allen and Blumenfeld seemingly havean ace up their sleeve, and thatsBridge, a professional development program for designers.The twodeveloped the program shortly after forming Designer Fund, armed with the belief that the classical education that most designstudentsreceive is good but is mostly applicable to print and physical objects, and that workingin tech requires different thinking.Companies like Slack, Pinterest, and Dropbox have since paid an undisclosed amount to enroll theirown designers in Bridge, which typically runs nine months and includes one intensive quarterof regularworkshops and talks with top designers, followed by more occasional dinners.Its a unique way that we can add material value to the local design community, says Allen.Theprogram probably doesnt hurt when it comes to deal flow, either.Indeed, Inkling, whichpublishes beautiful interactive instructional e-books, sent several of its designers through Bridge. Later, when two of those employeesstruck out on their own to form a startup, Designer Fund backed them.That company isMixmax, a startupwhose technology turns email interactive without a lot of plug-ins. Its other investorsinclude Harrison Metal, Floodgate, and renownedangel investor Ram Shriram.Pictured, from left to right: Heather Phillips, a design manager at Designer Fund; cofounder Ben Blumenfeld; product manager Katie Topper; general manager Lisa Anne Logan; andcofounder Enrique Allen. Phillips, Topper, and Logan largely focus on the Bridge program; Blumenfeld and Allen are now more focused on investing.
