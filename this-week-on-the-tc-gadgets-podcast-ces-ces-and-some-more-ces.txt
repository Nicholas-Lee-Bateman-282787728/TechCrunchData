The holiday season is over. January-style dread hangs thick in the air. And yet, the Consumer Electronics Show in the middle of the desert has found a way to lift our spirits. We looked at all kinds of gadgets, from 8K televisions to analog-style wearables to a whole host of Internet of Things-type products. There were robots. There was virtual reality. It was like Christmas happened all over again, but for tech bloggers. So, of course, we cant help but chat it out. We discuss all this and more on this weeks episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast featuring Kyle Russell, Romain Dillet, Darrell Etherington, and Jordan Crook.Have a good Friday, everybody!We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific.
