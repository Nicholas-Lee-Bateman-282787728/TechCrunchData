FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will join TechCrunch at theDisrupt NY conference next month to chat about technology policy and alittle thing you might have heard of called net neutrality.Wheeler has become at once a pariah and lauded leader in his role as chairman  most notably after his commission passed new net neutrality regulations on a party-line vote of 3-2. The congressional majority became incensed, called hearings, alleged White House manipulation, and all but upbraided the chairman as opposed to an open Internet.Wheelerhas supporters, of course, including a bevy of technology companies, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The American people weighed in on the matter as well, submitting millions of comments, mostly in favor of net neutrality.The net neutrality situation, where technology policy is headed, and how the FCC will workto ensure a competitive landscape are important anglesof the current market. And as tech becomes an increasingly key sector of the American economy, Chairman Wheeler has asserted the importance of the role of the FCC in setting the rules of competition.More on stage.
