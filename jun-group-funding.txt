Jun Group was founded back in 2005, but according to founder and CEO Mitchell Reichgut, the video ad company has never accepted any venture funding  until now.We really have been independent since day one, Reichgut said. (Jun Group has taken money from Western Technology Investment, but it was debt, not equity financing.)Today, however, the company is announcing that it has raised $28 million in its first institutional venture round. Why raise the money now? Reichgut said its because were in an historical time  moving from a desktop browser, search-based web to an app-based, mobile experience. Asa result, he said the mobile ad industry is ready to just absolutely take off.Jun Group, in particular, is focused on mobile video ads. A couple of years ago, it expanded into what Reichgut calls branded content,namely promotional websites and microsites, and he estimated that half of the companys business now comes from thatcategory. Thisdoesntsignal amovement away from video ads, though  its just that the video runs on an advertiser-owned site rather than in someone elses player.Brands, to say it succinctly  are becoming publishers, Reichgut said.The company has seen 90 percent annualized revenue growth over the past two years. As youd expect for a largely self-funded business, its profitable, and Reichgut said that even with the new round, his investors want Jun Group to remain profitable.Reichgut also argued that the funding is a vindication of Jun Groups emphasis on truth and openness. Amidst broader industry concerns of ad fraud, Jun Group says it regularly exceeds Moats benchmarks by 10 percent or more, and also comes in below 1 percent in Integral Ad Sciences fraud ratings.Were always speaking in plain English, and were always telling people where their ads are running, Reichgut said.
