Head spinning? Stomach gurgling? Did you just drink a Bloody Mary just to find some respite from your pounding gulliver? Why not take a look at Pekka Vnnens project, an attempt to play Quake on a Hitachi V-422 oscilloscope.Why? Because if it cant run Quake its not a true piece of technological hardware, thats why. But its pretty hard. To get the machine to display a comparatively complicated game, Vnnen had to simulate an oscilloscope in code and then learn how to program the Hitachi to move the ray across the screen.To actually display the images he had to output the results in audio format and got about 1,800 on the screen. You can even download some audio files to play the screens on your own workbench.
