If youre the kind of person who likes to talk tobusinesses on Twitter, the companyis rolling out some new options to improvethose interactions.First, businesses can now add a send a private message buttonto their tweets. So you might start a conversation with a business via public tweets, but at a certain point they can ask you to move to direct messaging with just a single tap or click. Second, Twitter is adding an option for businesses to privately ask youfor feedback after a customer service interaction.Now, I can imagine that this would be appealing to companieswhod prefer to discuss customer issues and complaints privately, rather than seeing them broadcast for everyoneto see. However, Twitter identifies some other advantages to these new features.Twitter is integrating these new features with existing customer service tools thanks to partnerships with Conversocial, Hootsuite, Lithium, Salesforce, Spredfast, Sprinklr and Sprout Social. TheDirect Message deep-linking feature should be available to all businesses today, andits already being used by brands like Delta, Starbucksand ClassPass. Meanwhile, the Customer Feedback feature will be rolling out over the next few weeks.
