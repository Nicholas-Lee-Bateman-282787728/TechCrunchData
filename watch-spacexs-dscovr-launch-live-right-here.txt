 This is the third time SpaceX has attempted to launch the DSCOVR, a satellite designed to go about four times further from the earth than the moon, and then provide whole-disc imagery of Earth, as well as warnings of extreme reactions from the sun that might be able to knock out power grids and communications. Advance warning could help people prepare in the case of extreme solar storms.SpaceX is targeting a launch window starting at 6:03 PM ET as the earliest possible lift-off point, after scrubbing a launch on Sunday evening due to a radar glitch, and cancelling one yesterday as well due to high winds. The launch was supposed to include a try at recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket via autonomous drone ship, but huge waves in the Atlantic mean that will have to wait for another day.Check out the launch live above, with streaming video from Cape Canaveral kicking off soon.
