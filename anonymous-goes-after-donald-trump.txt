Hacker collective Anonymous seems to be targeting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump after the real estate tycoon called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.One of the Twitter accounts for the hacker group said that it briefly took down http://www.trumptowernyc.com earlier, and the group has also seemingly posted a YouTube video warning Trump.Donald Trump, it has come to our attention that you want to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. This policy is going to have a huge impact. This is what ISIS wants. The more Muslims feel sad, the more ISIS feels they can recruit them. The more the United States appears to be targeting Muslims, not just radical Muslims, you can be sure that ISIS will be putting that on their social media campaign. Donald Trump, think twice before you speak anything. You have been warnedU.S. Uncut reports that this tweet, which shows a screenshot of Trumps site being attacked, also comes from a member of the Anonymous collective.Trumps divisive, unconstitutional comments come in the wake of a shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14, which was believed to be the first act of terror claimed by ISIS on American soil.The businessman and media personality has a history of making outlandish comments, which has only been amplified during the presidential race. Some would say the most consistent thing about Trumps policies and politics is his strategy of remaining the focus of media attention, by whatever means necessary.This latest comment, however, goes beyond Trumps own nonsense slinging campaign and actually threatens our nations security, according to Anonymous.Anonymous has also declared December 11 ISIS Trolling Day following an attack that allegedly hacked hundreds of ISIS social media accounts. The group asks people to take to social media and upload comical memes and images mocking ISIS using hashtags popularly used by ISIS members.
