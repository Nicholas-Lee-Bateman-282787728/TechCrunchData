YouTube isnt the only one to introduce a live-streaming app this week. Just days after YouTube Gaming was outed, Japans DeNA  a prolific producer of games itself  has entered the scene with its own take, called Mirrativ.Initially Android only, the app allows users to live broadcast literally anything that is on their screen. With DeNA, gaming is the first thing that springs to mind  DeNA is the partner that Nintendo selected to develop its first mobile games  but the company said thatMirrativ supports all apps, which could give it other uses too.The app takes away a lot of the complication when live-streaming  Twitch and others require cables and attachments to PCs to facilitate broadcast  butMirrativ does that with just three clicks.Broadcasters can opt to add their voice and face to their stream for personalization, but essentially the app will sit in the background and beam whatever they are doing on their phone  games, reading news stories, shopping  to their followers, which makes it far broader than any other screen broadcast app to date.In gaming terms, Kamcord offers impressive live-streamingon Android, too, but it is limited to select (high-profile) gamers at this point.Mirrativ opens the field to anyone with an Android device.Mirrativ borrows the familiar user interaction models that have been pioneered by to live-streaming services Periscope and Meerkat. Streams are shared with a users followers, and those watching can comment on what they see and add stars to show their appreciation. Right now, Mirrativ isnt saving broadcasts though, so theres no way to revisit streams once they are over.DeNA told TechCrunch that an iOS version of the app will come soon, but that it will be limited to watching, and not broadcasting, streams. Like Kamcord, DeNA has likely run into problems around support for live-streaming on iOS. That could change when Appleintroduces its first native replay feature fordevelopers in the form ofReplayKit in iOS 9, though.Mirrativ is available now in limited beta formahead of a full launch next month. While you can download the app, the company is givinga sneak-peek of live streamdemos each day  youll need to follow its Twitter account (@mirrativ) to get full details of each broadcast.
