London-based SAM Labs just announced that itraised 3.2M ($4.5M) from a group of investors led by Imperial Innovations. In addition to the institutional investor specializing in commercial spin-outs from academic institutions, the round was paddedout withsmart moneyfrom a number of angels specializingin high growth education technology.The investment willhelp the company continue its mission to introducethe Internet of Things to kids, to further develop the product, and to get a little bit closer to Sam Labs goal of making every childaged seven or older excited about technology.The high-end Family kit comes with a ton of different gizmos, but simpler kits are available, tooSparked into life in 2014 with a successful Kickstarter campaignbringing the company its first 800 or so customers (yours sincerely included), SAM Labs are continuing to create tools and software to help kids involved with IoT programming projects. The companys route to market has traditionally been via parents to children, with the kits being available via the companys own website, or in Londons Science Museum. In the case of the latter, the company made a 99 ($145) special Science Museum edition of its inventor kit, which the companys founder, Joachim Horn, says tremendously increased their exposure and number of sales.Part of the beauty of the SAM ecosystem is how intuitive it is to connect the buttons, sensors and apps.SAM Labs says more than 1,000 schools are already using the IoT learning kits as part of their learning- or after-school programs. With the new funding round, the company is setting its sights higher both in the UK and in a more international context, aiming to start marketing and selling to STEM-oriented schools around the world.Embracing the tenet of play-based learning, the kits come with a series of projects for kids to play with, including things like learning Morse code, making electronic songs, or creating a proximity-based alarm system.The SAM kits are simple, small, battery powered building blocks that talk to each other wirelessly via Bluetooth. They can then be programmed to interact using the SAM Appdrag-and-drop application, which makes it very easy indeed to get the various blocks to talk to interact; a button can turn on a light, send a Tweet, or start more advanced sequences of processes.Modules include buttons, LED lights, servos, sliders, tilt sensors, heat sensors, light sensors, and DC motors, buzzers and much more, which can be configured to do a stunning number offun things, as witnessed by the companys creations gallery. In addition to the sensors, the virtual cloud module can be used to use the computers camera to take photos, or to send messages out on social media.SAM Labs kits are not entirely unlike LittleBits offerings in this space, but the addition of the computer-based programming and the freedomof Bluetooth wireless means that SAM Labs kits are particularly well suitable as starting pointsfor children who have a curiosity for electronics, engineering and technology. Lets put it this way: I know what the 7-10 year olds in my life are getting for ChristmasAlso worth noting for parents hovering over the buy-now button, is that, theres a another thing that wasntaround when I was a kid: Logical directions to graduate out of SAM Labs ecosystemand into more elaborate hardware programming experiments on more advancedplatforms like Sparkfuns bite-sized projects,Adafruits learning kits, or Arduino-based projects.If you want to know more about the why and how, check out Joachims TED talk below.Correction: Imperial Innovations was incorrectly referred to as Imperial Ventures in a previous version of this article.
