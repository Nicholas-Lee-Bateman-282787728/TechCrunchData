Google is touting individuality in its latest Android Wear video ad, which hit the companys YouTube channel mere minutes before the Apple Watch event kicks off. And Google makes a valid point, too.Apart from different bands, an Apple Watch is an Apple Watch.

Like Android phones, Google is leaving the design up to OEMs. For better or worse, of course.
