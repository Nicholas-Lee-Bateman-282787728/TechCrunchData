Launched about a week ago, Beme is a new video-sharing app built byviral filmmaker Casey Neistatand Matt Hackett, former VP of Engineering at Tumblr and Hacker-in-Residence at betaworks.The duoraised $2.6 million in seed fundingled by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and havebeen working on the project together for about a year.With Beme, videorecording is done via the rearcamera in four-second bursts. However, instead of hitting a record button and watching the screen to see what youre filming, you capture video by covering your iPhonesproximity sensor, which is the little dot next to the front camera.This means you start recording by placing the phone upagainst your chest, forehead, or any other location (a finger also works) that would cover the sensor. In the appsintroductory video, Neistat shows how the app records when placed against your chest.While you are capturing videothe screen goes completely black, andusers have no way of previewing their contentbefore it is automatically shared.Viewing others videosisdone via a Snapchat-like interfacewhere you hold your finger down to play, and when the videos over, its gone forever.Besides the unique capture method, the second major feature is reaction, which lets you use the front camera to send a selfie to someone as youre watching their video.To understand why Neistat founded Beme, its necessary to understand his background in social media.NeistatsYouTube videos routinely get millions of views, and his daily vlogs often have 250,000 hitsin their first few hours of being live. Nike, J.Crewand Mercedes have all paid for the privilege ofbeing featured insome of Neistats work.These videos are known for carefully designedcamera shotsand editing that screams attention to detail,whichNeistat has admitted can take over three hours just for his daily 10-minute vlogs.So why would someone that puts so much effort into creating the perfect shot release an app where you cant even preview footage before it is shared with the world?Neistat explained to TechCrunch that he had become frustrated with the fact that things shared on social media (including his own work) are a very carefully created version of what someone wants to share.There was no existing solution to share unfiltered moments in life, which is why Beme was created. As much as Neistat lovessharing apps like Instagram (he has almost 400k followers), he says its not the right platform to share little photos of what he sees throughout the day. Instead, its a place to share beautifully edited aspects of ones life.According to Neistat, social media today is built to share with the world a version of who you are.Now, Beme wants you to share who you really are.As we were speaking, Neistat was looking through his YouTube account to see how his latest video was performing. In seven hours he had received 150,000 views, 7,000 thumbs up, and 48 thumbs down.However, he explained that these numbers dont exactly mean a lot to him.While he knows thousands of people enjoyed his video, he doesnt know what parts were their favorite, or what emotions they experienced when viewing.Neistatexplained that when he teaches college courses, he can show his videos to a room of 20 students, and by looking at their facial expressions caninstantly see their emotional reaction to his films.Beme tries to recreate thisemotional responseby ditchingany sort of likeor commentfeatures, instead limiting reactions to a selfie that viewers can capture and sent to the creator in real time, while viewing their content.While Neistat wouldnt share user numbers, he did tell TechCrunch that in the eight days since Bemes official launch, users have shared 1.1 million four-second videos, and sent 2.4 million photo reactions.This equates to about 50 days of recorded video, a tremendous feat for a small startup.While first Neistat and Hackett decided on a slow, invite-only rollout to make sureall users had at least one friend already on the platform, the codes quicklymorphed into a mechanism to throttlegrowthso the platform wouldnt crash.Access to the platform reached a fever pitch a day after the launch, when codes could be found on eBay for $5 to $10 each.Neistat told TechCrunch that the days of codes are almost over, as the team continues to work on scaling up the apps backend.Beme is available for download from the App Store, and users can reserve a username now, even if they dont have access to a code.
