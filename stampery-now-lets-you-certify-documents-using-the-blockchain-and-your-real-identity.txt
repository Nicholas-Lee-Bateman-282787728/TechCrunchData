Shortly after participating in our Battlefield competition at Disrupt SF, Stampery raised $600,000 from Draper Associates with Boost VC, Blockchain Capital and Di-Ann Eisnor also participating.As a reminder, Stampery lets you certify any document by sending an email attachment to your personal Stampery email address. You can also use the companys website, integrate Stampery in your product thanks to the API, or certify your documents in your Dropbox account directly. Stampery is also working on other services, such as Box.The company plans to replace notaries by leveraging bitcoins blockchain. Stampery issues legally binding proofs for all your sensitive documents. If you need to certify that you are viewing an unmodified document later on, you can prove the existence, integrity and ownership of this document by exploring the blockchain.Like with good old notaries, Stampery can help you with intellectual property cases, a will, an oath, a contract and more. By making it much easier to certify documents, Stampery hopes that it is going to become a habit. You can do everything from your computer, you dont have to physically see a notary.Recently, the company updated its API to allow anybody to stamp an unlimited amount of documents in the blockchain. Stampery also introduced a new way to prove the real identity of a document author. The company is linking a government ID with the blockchain in order to retrieve this ID later and notarize document using a real, proven identity.This feature is reminiscent of ShoCard. It was an important missing part in Stamperys product offering.Using the blockchain makes it much harder to hack into Stampery as proofs are stored in the blockchain  you cant modify the blockchain as its a distributed database. The good thing about Stampery is also that any independent third-party can verify the companys proofs. It doesnt matter if Stampery doesnt exist in 50 years. As long as the blockchain is still around, Stampery proofs will live on.
