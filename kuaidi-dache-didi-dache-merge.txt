The spirit of Saint Valentines Day is in full effect in Chinas taxi app space today after the countrys two biggest players  Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache  confirmed that they will merge.Media reports of a possible alliance surfaced late this week.Xinhua  Chinas state-run news service  reportedthat the companies will retain their respective branding and businesses after the merger. Neither side has disclosed the priceof the deal, but analysts estimate the value of the combined entity at around $6 billion. Thats because both servicesare believed to account for more than 95 percent of the taxi-hailing app market in China, which is estimated at 150 million monthly users.Yet, despite their dominance, the two are coming together to end a war of attrition which has seen each sidemake financial concessions and cut their feesto lure taxi drivers to their platform. In short, fighting each other was bad for business  pulling in the same direction makes more sense.The alliance may also help weather future government regulation which, for now, has not cut into either business.The duo arent short of backers.Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache are backed by two of Chinas most prominent internet companies, fierce rivals Alibaba and Tencent respectively, and both have raised significant amounts of capital.Didi Dache closeda $700 million funding round in December of last year, while Kuaidi Dache pulled in $600 million this January.This coming together is asetback forUbers efforts to break into the Chinese market.The U.S. company raised strategic funding from Baidu which included an integration with Baidu Maps and other services  but Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache are largely established among drivers and consumers already. Furthermore, as TechCrunchs Catherine Shu pointed out yesterday, the merger gives the Dache servicesan advantagein cities that have begun torestrict taxi drivers from using multiple apps.The deal was announced on Weibo, butthe companies investors are also adding their voices.As a shareholder in Kuaidi Dache, Alibaba Group is supportive of this merger as it will promote the healthy development of the taxi-app and expand city travel options for users, Alibaba added in a statement.Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache said that they will reveal more information at a press conference that will be held after the Lunar New Year.
