The ongoing concerns surrounding the YouTube Kids application  including its inability to completely filter out inappropriate content, as well as the way it blends content and commercial advertising in ways that may be difficult for children to understand  have now reached the U.S. Senate.Today, Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) took the floor to discuss the application and its issues, as well as the changes Google has made following pressure from Nelson and other consumer watchdog groups aboutthe apps content.Nelson had sent Google a letter in June which raised questions about the content in YouTube Kids and the concerns about how the app handled advertising.At the time, he wrote that while he applauded the companys effort in creating a destination for kids focused on education and entertainment, Google needed to ensure that kids were not unnecessarily exposed to inappropriate content, especially since parents may rely on the very notion that such a service is for kids and, thus, safe for their unfettered usage, the Senator wrote.Given Googles considerable technical expertise, the company can presumably and readily deploy effective filtering tools to screen for unsuitable videos, he added.YouTube earlier this month rolled out an update to the Kids app in response to the ongoing complaints, but consumer watchdog groups claim the changes still havent gone far enough.In the new version of the app, parents will now be shown a dialog box that informs them how videos are chosen as well ashow they can be flagged when inappropriate ones getpast the algorithms and human editors. Parents arealso now asked to explicitly enable or disable the search feature, which is how kids were coming across a lot of the inappropriate content to begin with. (The feature let them search for videos that werent included in YouTube Kidscurated selection.)Meanwhile, YouTubes position on advertising is a little more murky, saying that only paid ads have to meet a series of YouTubes advertising guidelines. But user-uploaded content, while possibly commercial in nature, would not be flagged as ads.Consumer watchdog groups, including Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) and Center for Digital Democracy (CDD), have pointed out that only a tiny fraction of the content on YouTube Kids is actually paid advertisements, but things like TV commercials, company-produced promotional videos, host selling and paid endorsements, arent necessarily being labeled as ads.Today, Senator Nelson stressedthat Google needed to do more about the content in YouTube Kids and presented to the Senate several examples of inappropriate videos found in the app.Using a number ofposter boards, he flipped through screenshots from YouTube Kidsincluding one video with instructions on how to tie a noose; a Howcast video titled How to open a beer with another beer; a video about wine tasting tips; another nursery rhyme for babies video containing bad language; avideo that instructed how to make sulfuric acid, and another that taught how to make toxic chlorine gas; and so on.This can go down to the toddler ageis that appropriate for young children? Nelson asked the floor.He then shared with the Senate Googles official response to his inquires, which included, essentially, the changes we wrote about this month involving the way YouTube classifies paid advertising and the instructional information now provided to parents.I want to share with the Senate what I think issteps in the right direction, but its not enough, said Nelson, before reading Googles letter.Though sometimes the tech community pokes fun at legislators lack of understanding of how technology works, Nelson actually made a fewgood points.For example, why would a YouTube Kids application ever return video search results for a search for the keyword beer? Shouldnt that be fairly simple to filter out without a parents intervention (i.e. by disabling the search feature entirely)?Nelson also noted that Google didnt answer his questions about the age range the YouTube Kids app targets, and it didnt clearly answer a question about how long inappropriate videos remain online after theyre being flagged. (Google had told us within hours.)Additionally, after reading Googles response as tohow it handles ads, Nelson quipped, thats nice. Now, how do we get those beer advertisements off of there?However, Nelson did miss anopportunity to note that because Google only enforces policy around paid ads, its not regulating the other advertising on the service which YouTube users are uploading themselves, often without proper disclosure. Instead, the Senator was far more concerned with the adult-oriented content found in the app.Concluding his briefing,Nelson didnt let Google off the hook, saying that while he appreciated theresponse to his inquiry, these changes were only a first step.If theres a privilege of doing an app like this, then there must be accountability. And Google must accept that responsibility to be accountable, he said.Google Response to Nelson
