Andy Jassy, senior vice president at Amazon Web Services, announced a new machine learning platform today at the AWS Summit in San Francisco.The Amazon Machine Learning service is designed to give developers without machine learning background the tools to build smart, data-driven applications that can not only analyze whats happening in real time or what happened in the past, but alsopredict whats going to happen in the future (and thats whats most interestinghere).Companies like Netflix have been using AWS toolsto undertake machine learning tasks for some time, but as Jassy said, its hard work, and AWS wanted to create a service specifically suited to machine learning without requiring specific expertise.As with so many tools we see on AWS, the roots of the new toolbegan on Amazon.com where the companyhas been experimenting with various forms of machine learning for years. When you look at the recommendation engine  if you bought this, you might also like that  itwas an early form of it.Developers, regardless of their role, are increasingly interacting with data on a more regular basis, Dr. Matt Wood from AWS pointed out. They typically look back at what happened or maybe they can see whats happening in real time, but the real value comes when you can askquestions about the data youre seeing.For example, you could askabout fraudulent activities on an eCommerce site or which content a person might like to see next based on what he or she is looking at now.AWS recognized that these types of predictions required lots of different expertise around statistical analysis, model building, data cleansing and so forth, then there was the whole idea of ingesting and scaling to deal with varying amounts of data and figuring out how to make predictions.Amazon wanted to simplify this process and allow any developer to quickly build and validate a model and process millions or even billions of predictions in real time. Itbelieves Amazon Machine Learning solvesthis problem.The new tool requires three basic steps:To test the new platform, Amazon developed a couple of experiments. In the first itlet two developers try and predictcustomer gendermore accurately. Armed with this information, Amazon.com can make better recommendations, but using the system it had in place only provided65 percent gender prediction accuracy. Two developers without any expertise attacked this problem and in 45 days, they had improved the accuracy from 65 to 92 percent.Then they gave another developer the same task, except this person was usingAmazonMachine Learning.Jassy claimed he was able to achieve the same 92 percent accuracy in just 20 minutes.Its worth keeping in mind that the model might have been built and validated already, but the point is that you can drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to get these kind of answers with these tools.AWS will have some competition in this space. Azure launched itsownmachine learning toolin February. IBM also has a machine learning capabilities built into Watson, which it enhanced with the purchase of AlchemyAPI last month.
