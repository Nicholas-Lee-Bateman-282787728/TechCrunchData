Part of the Y Combinator Winter 2016 class, REVL just launched asmart action camera that solves the two worst things about action cams: shaky footage and a cumbersome editing process.Developed by ex-NASA, Sikorsky and HP engineers, the REVL Arc has a built-in motorized gimbal to keep the cameras view level with the horizon.The 4K camera is also waterproof up to 10 feet, packs Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and hasa battery that gives it 90 minutes of 4K recording time.Arcalso packs built-in sensors to track altitude, speed and rotation, which are used to detect activity and help make smart recommendations about what recorded footage is best. For example, the editing algorithm can use captured telemetry data from an hour-long ski run and pull out and feature the clips where the skier was doing a jump or rail, leaving boring footage in the background.This smart editing will be done via REVLs app, which is focused on providing quick shoot-edit-share functionality. The editing platform will also pay homage to Snapchats filters by letting users overlay telemetry data like altitude and speedon top of recorded video.In addition to YC, backers include Bill Tai, James Lindenbaum and Google Maps co-founder Lars Rasmussen, who have contributed a total of $2 million in seed funding.The camera is launching on Indiegogo today, and will ship in December 2016.
