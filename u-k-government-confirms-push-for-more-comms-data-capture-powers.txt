As expected, the newly elected U.K. Conservative government has confirmed its intentionto pushfor broader powers to capture online communications, announcing a forthcoming Investigatory Powers Bill in its legislative plan for the five-year Parliament, revealed today in the Queens speech.The Bill will beaimed ataddressing what the governmentterms capability gaps in law enforcement and intelligence agencies abilities to combat terrorism and serious crime.Thekey aims are stated as:Better equipping law enforcement and intelligence agencies to meet their key
operational requirements, and addressing the gap in these agencies ability to
build intelligence and evidence where subjects of interest, suspects and
vulnerable people have communicated online.The governmentdoes not specify exactly what thesecapability gaps are (in its view), but Prime Minister David Cameron has previously spoken out against strong encryption  arguing it should always bepossible for intelligence agencies to access data in extremis.Home Secretary Theresa May has also previously made plain her support for more extensive powers of data retention pushing, in the last Parliament, for legislation that would have forced Internet companies toretaindata about online conversations, social media activity, calls and text messages for 12 months (measureswidely criticized as aSnoopers Charter).That Bill was derailed by the then-governments coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats. However the new Tory administration now has a working majority without any partner parties so it has the chance todrive through its own legislative agenda, undiluted.Fulldetails of what the government isplanning will have to wait for adraft version of the Investigatory Powers Bill to bepublished. The BBC reports that more details about the Billare expected to be publishedin the coming days.As well as expanded data capture powers, the government saysthe planned legislationwill aim to maintain the ability of our intelligence agencies and law enforcement to targetthe online communications of terrorists, paedophiles and other seriouscriminals, and also modernise our law in these areas and ensure it is fit for purpose.In the previous Parliament the government fast trackedemergency surveillance legislation (the Data Retention and Investigative Powers Bill) to maintain its digital data gathering powers,after European data retention legislation was struck down by Europes top court on the grounds that it was disproportionate. DRIPA has a sunset clause meaning itexpires atthe end of 2016, so the government is presumably looking toroll similardata capture powers into the new bill (which wont havean expiry date).Lastly the briefing notes on the forthcoming Investigatory Powers Bill state it will providefor appropriate oversight and safeguard arrangements, andwillrespond to issues raised in the independent review by theIndependent Reviewer of Counter-Terrorism legislation, which it notes is due to bepublished shortly.Ongoing scrutiny hasfallen on state surveillance activities in the wake of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowdens revelations about thesystematic digital data capture being undertaken by government intelligence agencies. Documents released by Snowden have forced intelligence agencies to acknowledge certainsecret data capture programs and processes  and encouraged debate about the legality of government activities and failures of oversight.At the European level especially there hasbeen condemnation of unchecked dragnet surveillance. But even the IPT, the U.K. court that oversees domesticintelligence agencies, ruledthat some past surveillance data-sharing activity was not legal.Add to that,back in March, the U.K. parliaments Intelligence and SecurityCommittee called for a new single act of Parliament to govern how domestic spy agencies operate  with the aim of improving transparency and public trust.
