Heres a surprise: Facebook is closing its Parse developer platform.After acquiring the service, which at the time mostly focused on mobile developers, for a reported $85 million in 2013, Facebook turned Parse into one of its key developerservices.Parse will still operate until January 28, 2017, so developers have time to move their products over to other platforms. That will still be quite a hassle for the devs behind the 600,000 apps built on the platform.Forcing developers into changes, especially ones as drastic as this, can shake their trust. In the future when Facebook opens opportunities for developers, like the chat bot SDK we recently discovered, they might be apprehensive about investing time and resources into platforms from a company with a poor history of continued support.Parse  and its CEO and co-founder Ilya Sukhar  prominently featured in Facebooks developer conference keynotes, too. Sukhar, however, left Facebook last year and its been awhile since we last heard about the service. Heres a video about what Parse did:We understand that this wont be an easy transition, and were working hard to make this process as easy as possible, Parses other co-founder Kevin Lacker writes in todays announcement. We are committed to maintaining the backend service during the sunset period, and are providing several tools to help migrate applications to other services.The company says it will offer a number of tools for migrating databases and its also open-sourcing the Parse Server so developers will run most of the Parse API from their own Node.js servers(or one hosted on a platform like Heroku). The idea behind using a service like Parse, however, has always been that developers could avoid dealing with servers, so it remains to be seen how many of its current users will make this switch.Facebooks decision to shutter Parse definitely comes as a massive surprise  not in the least to the developers who have came to rely on it over the last few years. But the overall landscape has changed since 2013.Amazon, Google and Microsoft(and numerous other startups) now offer very similar tools fordevelopers.Its unclear how much traction Parse still had in the last year or so, but Facebook probably looked at it and decided it wasnt worth its effort anymore.This whiplash got so bad that developers became vocal critics of Facebooks actions  not unlike now:Parse is the key trend on Twitter in SF right now and the dev channels I participate in are up in arms @ingridlunden Matthus Krzykowski (@matthausk) January 28, 2016Facebook eventually had to drum up a big campaign called Operation Developer Lovein hopes of reassuring devs that it would be more cautious and communicative about changing its platform. You can feel the legacy of that effort in the fact that Parse will remain available for an entire year before it shuts down.Yet still, it feels like Facebook has once again put its bottom line above the well being of its developerfamily.
