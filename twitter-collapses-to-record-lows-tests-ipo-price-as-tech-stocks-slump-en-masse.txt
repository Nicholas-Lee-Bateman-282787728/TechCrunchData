It skyrocketed from that dollar point, eventually managing a $39.93 billion market capitalization in the closing days of 2013. Sincethen, the companyhas struggled to prove to the investing community that it can grow its core audience at a respectable pace.While Twitter has generally performed well on financial metrics, it has struggled on the front lines, and the manner in which it might grow its user base more rapidly has long been a parlor game in Silicon Valley.Closing at $26, Twitter traded below its IPO price during the day. The $30 mark for Twitter equity is generally seen as a trigger point, perhaps both internally and externally. If you are familiar with the annals of public share prices, the $30 mark is Twitters Microsoft $40, in other words.Twitters all-time highwas$73.71 per share, nearly three times its current value. Itsshareshave fallen more than 25 percent in recentmonths, and the companys public equity is down over 46 percent from its 52-week high of $55.99, a record set in October of 2014.Todays selloff followed the announcement of a major overhaul for Twitters mobile advertising platform which it has rebranded as the Twitter Audience Platform. The revamp aims to make it easier for advertisers to push users toward their video content through custom Promoted Tweets.The social firm was not alone in taking a hard one to the chin today, as it was a tough day for tech stocks more broadly: Netflix plunged 7.8 percent; Facebook fell 5 percent; and LinkedIn dropped 4.3 percent.
