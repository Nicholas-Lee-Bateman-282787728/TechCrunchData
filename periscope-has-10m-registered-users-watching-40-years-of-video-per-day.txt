Periscope may have just hit the impressive milestone of 10 million registered users after just four months, but what it wants you to focus onis the sheer volume of video content that its users are streaming: nearly 40 years of watch time every day from its iOS and Android apps.The lifetime of content, which amounts to just over 350,000 hours of video streamed per day, doesnt even include the videos viewedthrough browsers onperiscope.tv, asthe service is still looking to track Time Watched on that medium more precisely.Periscope detailed in a blog postwhy the servicewas prioritizing Time Watchedover more conventional metrics like monthly active users:Optimizing for DAU/MAU doesnt properly motivate our team to create a product that people love. Heres why: if we were motivated to grow DAU, wed be incentivized to invest in a host of conventional growth hacks, viral mechanics, and marketing to drive up downloads. This direction doesnt necessarily lead to a better product, or lead to success for Periscopers.Kayvon Beykpour, Periscopes cofounder and CEO, held a Q&A periscope stream earlier today discussing the postand Periscopes growth thus far.He unveiled some interesting factoids regardingthe growth of the service thus far.While answering user questions he also hinted at some upcoming featuresthat the Periscope team had been working on.
