Google today announced two notablechanges that will affect the rankings of search results for users accessing Google search on mobile devices. It will now take into consideration a sites mobile-friendliness as one of its ranking signals, and information from indexed mobile applications will also begin to influence ranking for signed-inusers who have the app installed on their smartphone.As more people use mobile devices to access the internet, our algorithms have to adapt to these usage patterns, explains Google in its announcement.The changes follow a number of previous efforts Google has madeto improve its search results for mobile users.In 2013, for example, it rolled out ranking changes that would affect sites that were misconfigured for smartphone users, including those frustrating situations where a specific URL would redirect all smartphone users to the websites mobile homepage instead of their preferred destination. This was common among news sites, in particular, asuserswould often click a link to read a certain story and would end up landing on the sites main webpage, the story nowhere to be found.Last summer, meanwhile, Google began flagging sites that wouldnt display on mobile devices due to the technology they used  like those built with Adobe Flash, which meant they wouldntdisplay on iOS devices or Android 4.1 and higher.And inNovember, Google began adding a mobile-friendly label to its search results accessed on mobile devices to indicate they would display well on your smartphones small screen, after first testing warning labels earlier in the year.It noted at the time it was also testingthe use ofthe mobile-friendly criteria as a ranking signal.Today, Google says that starting on April 21, it will expand its use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal to all languages worldwide  something it notes will have a significant impact on search results.In a blog postdetailingthe changes, the companypoints website owners to a number of resources that can help them prepare for this shift, including itsguide to mobile-friendly sites, itsMobile-Friendly Testing tool, and itsMobile Usability Report.In addition, the company also said it will begin taking advantage of its efforts withdeep-linking technology to begin to surface information from mobile apps higher in its search results.Deep links, for those unfamiliar, point to specific pages within mobile applications themselves. That means developers who implement theselinks in their apps allow Google to index their apps in a similar way as it does websites today.This app indexing technology was first introduced in fall 2013 during Googles press event regarding its KitKat mobile operating system. At the time, the company explained how Android developers would be able to attract and re-engage app users by allowing Google search to point to their apps pages directly.In the months since that announcement, the company has been steadily expanding the number of mobile apps that took advantage of deep linking, adding dozens more last spring, then later integrating the deep-linking technology with AdWords in order to allow developers to create ads that would lead to users launching their app.In related news, Google also announced this morning it was going to begin allowing app developers to run search ads in its Google Play stores results, too.
