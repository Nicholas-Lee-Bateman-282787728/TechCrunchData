There are plenty of smart lighting systems out there that let you change light colors and dim with just your smartphone (or even your voice), but a freshly Kickstarted product called the Ario is a smart lighting system that works to benefit your health.The Ario mimics the natural light of the sun as it passes overhead each day, generating bright blue light in the morning and warmer amber light in the evening.Ario cofounder and CEO Brian Hoskins explained that blue light aids in the production of cortisol, which is important to giving the human body energy in the morning, and red light aids in the production of sleep-inducing melatonin.Hoskins said that the vast majority of Americans spend more than 8 hours a day under unnatural light, which can throw off the bodys internal clock and prevent it from performing at optimum levels.The Ario smart lamp aims to change that by pairing with Wifi and learning youre home and adjusting the light to match your sleep schedule.The Ario Smart Lamp campaign hit its $50,000 goal in a single day, with the projected retail price going in the $300 range, according to Hoskins.You can check out the Ario for yourself here.
