Snapdeal, the SoftBank- and eBay-backed online commerce company in India, has completed what it called one of the biggest acquisitions in the history of the internet industry in India after it announced the acquisition of onlinetransaction service FreeCharge.The companies are not disclosing a price, but the Economic Times, which first reported onan impending deal last month, previously pegged itsvaluation at$450 million. If correct, that would surpass Snapdeal rival Flipkarts purchase of Myntra last year, which we understand was $330 million.Snapdeal said FreeCharge will continue to function as an independent platform and all aspects of [its]shopping experience will remain intact, thoughit plans to extend the integration between the two services.FreeCharge is a service that rewardsusers with coupons when they top up their phone credit orpay utility bills. It claims more than 15 million users in India  it recently raised an $80 million Series C and countsSequoia Capital among its investors. (In total, it raised $115 million.) FreeCharge is particularly interesting because a high proportion of its business comes from mobile devices (85 percent), while more than half of its customers have payment cards associated with their accounts  making them ripe for conversioninto regular Snapdeal customers.That focus on mobile makes the deal a potentially key one forSnapdeal, which is battling Flipkart and Amazon for supremacy in Indias e-commerce market. Sales ofsmartphones in India doubled from 156 million units in2013 to 364 million in 2014that growth is set to continue and take India past 500 million internet users in the coming fewyears, the bulk of whom will be on mobile devices.Given the promise of the market, Indias top e-commerce firms are raising funding and expanding their services to capture larger chunks of the market and position themselves to take advantage ofthe growing audience of internet-connected consumers.Amazon pledged $2 billion to grow its business in India, whileFlipkart and Snapdeal both raised significant roundsof funding from investors last year. Snapdeal has spent some of itscapital on a number of acquisitionsof late  including loan service Rupeepower, recommendations platform Wishpickerand luxury goods marketplace Exclusively.Each one, however, has been kept undisclosed, just like the SnapCharge deal.Mobile payments are becoming a key battleground as Indias e-commerce leaders mature, and earlier today MobiKwik landed $25 million from a string of investors that included American Express and Cisco. The company is aiming to reach 100 million registered users of its mobile wallet by next year, and is targeting a $100 million Series C round forthe second half of this year.Finally: Credit is due to both Snapdeal and FreeChargeforthe way they playfully revealed theirdeal on Twitter:.@FreeCharge Hey, psst I have something for you.
