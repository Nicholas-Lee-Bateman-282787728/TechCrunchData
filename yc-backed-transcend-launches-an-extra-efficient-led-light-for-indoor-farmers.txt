Transcend Lighting, one of the more unconventional startups acceptedinto Y Combinators latest cohort, is launching out of beta today to bring its energy-saving LED lights toindoor farmers everywhere.Founder Brian Bennett, an optical engineer by training, invented the first Transcend prototype after his father challenged him to build some LED lights for the family farm in upstate New York.When the lights he designedwere successful, Bennett entered a business plan competition at Columbia, won some money to continue developing the idea, and was accepted into Y Combinators Spring 2015 class.Farms today, generally speaking, use high pressure sodium lights, which are the same lights as street lamps, says Bennett. That works, and plants grow reasonably well under them, but it wastes a lot of energy.Trancends bulbs differ from typicalLED lights because they only use blue light. The company has developeda wavelength conversion system that uses phosphorous to convert blue photons, which are the most efficient typeof photon, into any other color photon.Phosphors have been around for a long time, says Bennett. What we do differently is we have phosphors specifically tuned to photosynthesis, whereas everyone else tunes them to humans so that lights seem brighter.By switching to Transcends lights, farmers have been able to reduce their energy consumption byup to 70 percent,Bennett tells me.Believe it or not, marijuana is not the only plant grown indoors or hydroponically. Bennett says that half of Transcends early customers are marijuana growers, butthe other half includelettuce, tomato and pepper farmers primarilyon the East Coast.As drought conditions worsen, indoor farming presents an appealing alternative for some farmers because growing hydroponically only requires 10 percent of the water consumed by outdoor farming, according to Bennett.And by growing indoors, farmers can control the whole environment  the temperature, the humidity, the CO2 levels, the light levels  which means they can grow year-round.The indoor growing business is a multi-billion dollar business, and its booming right now especially with more technology, Brian says. With products like ours that reduce energy consumption significantly, it can be much more profitable to grow indoors.Transcends light fixtures go for $999 each, and the company projects that each light will pay for itself in energy savings in the span of a year.Bennett says theyre already receiving orders from commercial farming operations, and planning to launch an Indiegogo campaign later this summer for a second lighting product.
