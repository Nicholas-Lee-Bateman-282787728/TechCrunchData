Around June of last year, Lucasfilm and its usual cohorts  Industrial Light and Magic, Skywalker Sound  announcedthey were banding together to form the ILM Experience Lab, or ILMxLab. The new team would focus largely on figuring out how to translate the Star Wars universe into something magical in virtual reality.The teams latest project, Trials on Tatooine, a VR experiment (read: probably pretty short) that taps the wonderfully capable HTC Vive headset, looks friggin amazing.We got our first glimpse of ILMxLabs efforts back in December, with the release of Jakku Spy for Google Cardboard. Alas, Google Cardboard doesnt have much in terms of input, so Jakku Spy was mostly a sit-back-and-watch experience.This one, on the other hand, is built for the HTC Vive and that means they get to bring the Vives super-accurate, full-motion-tracking hand-held controllers into the mix. And that, of course, means lightsabers.The ILMxLab team is doing private demos of the new experiment at the GDC conference this week, but theres no word yet on if/how/when they intend to release it publicly. Most folks dont have an HTC Vivejust yet  after all, preorders of the Vive wont even ship until April.[via RoadToVR]
