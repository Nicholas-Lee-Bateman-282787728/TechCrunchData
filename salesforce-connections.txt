Salesforce.com is announcing a new version of its Marketing Cloud.The company is unveiling the new features today in New York City at its Connections event for digital marketers. Its adding new features to its Journey Builder, a drag-and-drop tool for managing customer interactions, and to Active Audiences, which connects customer data to online ad campaigns.For Journey Builder, Salesforce is offering new Native Journeys that integrate with its existing Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. That means marketing teams have more capabilities when designing journeys that cross over betweenthe marketing, sales and customer service teams. Its also announcing new, pre-built triggers that use interactions like joining a loyalty program or downloading an app to begin a customer journey.Vice President of Product Marketing Gordon Evans said these changesreflect a broader trend of blurring the line between different teams within a brand.As a consumer, they just have one relationship with the brand, whether theyre in a sales, service or marketing interaction, Evans said.Salesforce is also enabling advertisersto do more with that data, specifically by integrating its Active Audiences targeting with a number of display ad networks, including LiveRamp, LiveIntent, Neustar and Viant.The new Active Audience capabilities should be available in the third quarter of this year, Salesforce says, while the new Journey Builder should be available in Q4.
