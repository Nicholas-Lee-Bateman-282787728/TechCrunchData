LinkedIn handily beat analystexpectations today with revenue of $780 million and earnings of 78 cents per share.Analysts were expecting earnings of 45 cents per share on about $756 million in revenue.LinkedIn shares promptly spiked as much as 8 percent in extended trading.In total, the companys revenue grew 37 percent year-over-year, up from around $568 million in the third quarter last year.The companys Talent Solutions division was its fastest growing segment, up 46 percent year-over-year to $502 million in revenue. Marketing solutions grew 28 percent to $140 million in revenue, while subscription revenue grew 21 percent year-over-year to $138 million to round out the rest of the companys revenue report.So, as expected, the companys recruiting segment continues to be one of its fastest-growing. LinkedIn has basically become the go-to service for what are effectively a more modern form of resumes, making it a gold mine for recruiters seeking new talent.So its not all that surprising that recruiting and the companys Talent Solutions division is one of its most important  and getting a lot of attention.The company has two new launches coming up  its referrals product in November, and a new revamped Recruiter platform coming early next year. Both those products are geared toward better automating the process, and eliminating redundant tasks, of searching for new recruits.LinkedIn is one of those stocks that tends to jump wildly on earnings reports. So todays huge spike isnt necessarily that much of a surprise. On the year, LinkedIn has been about flat. In recent months its recovered a bit, now down only 5 percent for the year to date, but its down from a high of around $270 per share, currently trading as high asaround $237 after the company reported its earnings.Were updating this post as more information comes in.
