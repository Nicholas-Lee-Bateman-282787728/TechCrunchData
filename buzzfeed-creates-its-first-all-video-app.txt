BuzzFeed is launching a new mobileapp today called BuzzFeed Video, giving you a chance to see all of its videos in one place.Since pretty much every online media company is ramping up its video production, it makes sense to createan app like this. But its also a bit of a left turn for BuzzFeed, given the way its executives have been promoting their distributed media strategy, with unique content published to Facebook, YouTube and elsewhere.In other words, its a strategy where no one website or appis necessarily the center of the BuzzFeed universe. However, the companysapp product director Jesse Shapins (he joined last year through the acquisition of GoPop) said that this approach has a downside, namely, A large audience connected to BuzzFeed doesnt even know the full breadth of our content.That doesnt mean the companyis changing course, necessarily. But it doesnt hurt to give fans find all the BuzzFeed videos they could possibly want.Shapins demoed the new BuzzFeed Video app for me yesterday  a process that took fiveminutes, tops, since the goal was to create a super simple experience. There are two sections to the app, one for trending (individual) videos, and another for browsing and subscribing todifferent shows (once youve subscribed, youll get a push notification whenever theres a new episode). The videos auto-play directly in the feed, moving into an immersive mode where everything else fades into the background.Also worth noting: BuzzFeed is using its own native video player for the app, rather than relying on YouTube or Facebook. Shapins said that allows the app to collect more data about user activity, gives the company more flexibility in how it wants to make money and delivers a better user experience.To be clear, BuzzFeed Video doesnt currently include every single video that the company has ever created. Instead, its starting out with a big chunk of the existing catalog and will include every new video moving forward. The company also plans to window some of its shows, so that new episodes are available in the app before theyre posted anywhere else.BuzzFeed Video is available for iOS and Android.
