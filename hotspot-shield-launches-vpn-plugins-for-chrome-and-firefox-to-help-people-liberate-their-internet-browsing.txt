Afree and unrestricted internet can be a dangerous place, but its always important for the tools that prevent government or corporate censorship of the web to stay one step ahead of the blockers.Hotspot Shield, the worlds largest VPN Proxy service with over 350 million downloads to date, just launched a pair of web browser plugins for Chrome and Firefox browsers that will make browsing blocked content around the globe easier than ever, while securing and anonymizing online activity.Unlike past iterations of the service Hotspot Shield for web is completely ad-free, while still offering unlimited bandwidth usage so users can access sites like Facebook, Netflix and YouTube regardless of whether the websites are blacklisted in the users country.I chatted withLevent Sapci, the Director of Marketing at Hotspot Shield, who told me that their product has had a major influence acrossthe globe in protecting peoples access to an internet not restricted by government censorship.This has been a bizarre time for internet freedom incountries like Russia that have (shortly) blocked sites like Reddit and Wikipedia. Meanwhile, users in countries like China have long relied on VPNs to access sites such asFacebook in their country, which has a worse track record for keeping the internet free than most.VPNs arent just for combatting blacklists from repressive governments, they also allow users to access streamed content that may not be approved for playback in their country. Services like Netflix, for instance, arent available in every country, but with a Hotspot Shield plug-in users can toggle on the VPN and access theUS/UK/French/Canadian Netflix or any other Netflix region regardless ofwhere theyare.Ultimately, Sapci said that Hotspot Shields goal was to make theirproducts as accessible to users as possible, and that browser plug-ins, with their direct browser integration and quick install times, were ideal for users that may not have utilized a VPN before to protect their web traffic and liberate their browsing experience.
