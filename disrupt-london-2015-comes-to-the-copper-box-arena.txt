Its just a few short months until some of the best and brightest minds in tech will be descending upon London for TechCrunch Disrupt London 2015, and were thrilled to announce that the event will take place at theCopper Box Arena.The Copper Box Arena was built specifically to accommodate the 2012 Summer Olympic games in London. It was originally called the Handball Arena, since it was going to be primarily used for the handball competition in the games, but was renamed in January 2012 to reflect that the arena would be used for more than just handball. It was renamed the Copper Box Arena because, well, it looks like a giant copper box.Since the Olympics, the 7,000-plus seat venue has been converted into a multi-sport arena for community use, being used for things like music, comedy, entertainment, health and fitness, sport, conferences and exhibitions  including Disrupt.The venue hosts some of Londons prominent sports teams, including the London Lions basketball team, the London GD Handball Club and the Leyton Netball Club, and has hosted events like the Invictus Games for wounded and disabled servicemen and women and the Grand Prix of Badminton.Were thrilled that Disrupt will be taking place in such an impressive venue, and we cant wait to have all of you over to the Copper Box Arena for the best startup conference in Europe.
