If you follow the venture industry, youve probably heard about the barbell effect a lot in recent years. Its a metaphor for the many individualsand smallventure funds investing in lots of seed-stage companies andat the opposite end of the spectrum  the venture, growth, hedge and mutual funds thathave enormous amounts of money to deploy and have driving up the valuations of maturingstartups.According to a new third-quarter report from CB Insights and KPMG, that barbell is beginning to look more like a ski slope, with far fewer small seed fundingsgetting sewn up yet (and seed deals started to look increasingly like traditional Series A and even Series B deals), yetno apparent slowdown at all mega-financings. In fact, 23 new billion-dollar-plus companies were created inthe third quarter alone, up from 12 in the third quarter of 2014.Other interesting points from the report: Asia is ascendant. At least, its still in the midst of a massive funding bump, despite Chinas IPO shutdown.As for Europe, its growing but its much more tempered, says CB Insights founder Anand Sanwal. The good news for Europe is its growing-seed stage activity; it should portend good things for the ecosystem as some of those companies mature.If youd like alook at thewhole (free) data-studded report, you can check it out right here.
