TechCrunch is excited to announce today that the entire SV Angel partnership is headed to Disrupt NY 2015. That means Ron Conway, David Lee, Brian Pokorny, Topher Conway, Robert Pollak and Kevin Carter will take the stage together, bringing their collective wisdom and experience to Disrupt.Over the years, members of the legendary Silicon Valley fund have attended and spoken at various Disrupt conferences. Ron Conway was even a judge at the first TC40 in 2007 (TripIt impressed him back then.) But this is the first time the group will take the stage together.Started in 2009, the seed-stage firm was founded by Ron Conway and ex-Googler David Lee. Conway had been writing checks to fledgling companies since the 80s, connecting entrepreneurs with talent along the way. As David Lee later explained on Quora, the fund attempts to institutionalize Conways proven method.SV Angel invests primarily while companies are young. Most often other venture firms are brought in on financing rounds to provide services such as advising and leadership. SV Angel does things differently. The firm works with its portfolio companies not by providing direct leadership and guidance as most firms do, but by connecting and developing relationships for its portfolio companies with others throughout the Valley.The prolific firm has had a hand in just about every Silicon Valley hit, and has been known to invest in more than 100 companies a year.According to CrunchBase data, SV Angel has made 591 investments over the past six years. Nine of the companies went public and 155 were acquired. And thats just the investments made on behalf of the firm. The partners are free to make personal investments, too.Were thrilled to have the whole gang speak at Disrupt.The show runs May 4-6 at the historic Manhattan Center. Tickets are available at an early bird discount rate until April 11th. More speakers will be announced in the coming weeks. Trust us: This is a show you do not want to miss.
