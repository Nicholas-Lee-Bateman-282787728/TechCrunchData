Last year at CES we were introduced to Onewheel, a crazy new self-balancing skateboard built by electromechanical engineer and board sports enthusiast Kyle Doerksen. Less than a year after the project went up on Kickstarter, Onewheel is shipping to early backers and those who pre-ordered the device.A few weeks ago, we got a tour of the Onewheel assembly line to see how it gets put together and to sneak a peek at some new features the team has added to the devices mobile app. Onewheel is assembled in a factory in San Jose, where the different components are pieced together and tested out before being shipped out to customers.While the hardware has made strides since the earliest prototype the team put together last year, some of the biggest changes have come in the software that helps control the board. By connecting to Onewheel via Bluetooth, the app can be used to customize the way the board handles.For the novice rider, Onewheel has a basic setting that restricts the speed and handling to help users get used to the board. But as they get more advanced, they can change to a more advanced setting, which allows them higher speeds and more control over it.
