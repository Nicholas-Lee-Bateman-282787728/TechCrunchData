Apple has now spent a fair amount of time showing us how Apple Watch apps will work on its wearable, which launches on April 24 (with pre-orders starting April 10), but few have had a chance to try out the software for themselves. Dedicated watch app site WatchAware has spent considerable time and effort providing interactive teaser trailers that provide a basic idea how apps for Apple Watch will work in practice, however, and you can find a collection of those embedded below that include all the third- and some of the first-party apps Apple has featured both at Mondays show, and at the iPhone launch event last September where the Apple Watch was first introduced to the world.InstagramThe Facebook-owned photo sharing app was one of the pieces of software that Apple had running on demo units at Mondays hands on showcase, and it provides a full image feed for casual browsing without a need to pull your phone out of your pocket. The app works pretty much like youd expect, but theres a second level view for seeing likes and interactivity options, making it mostly a browsing experience.SPG: Starwood Hotels & ResortsStarwood is one of the partners that helps Apple showcase some of the more futuristic powers made possible by the Watch. The app from the hotelier allows guests to check in, and to unlock their hotel room door remotely in select locations. Increasingly, I think well see people use the Watch as a device that can interact widely with its surroundings, and this is a good initial example of that kind of thing.UberUber has become an essential launch app in the way that Facebook and Twitter have been on mobile platforms in the past. The hailing app is a perfect fit for a wearable, as evidenced by the fact that it was also one of the premier pieces of software offered on Android Wear.WeChatThis is part of Apples growing efforts to market directly to its expanding Asian customer base, since WeChat is among the fastest growing mobile chat apps in China and India. On the wrist, it offers a great way to quickly communicate, as well as send WeChats signature stickers.Alarm.comApple Watch has a strong connected home angle, and the Alarm.com app provides a way to monitor home status, both for piece of mind and for remote control. This app was part of yesterdays stage show, too.TwitterA Twitter app is one of those things a platform needs to be taken seriously these days, and Apples demo reveals its among the more full-featured experiences, giving you access to much of the mobile apps functionality on your wrist. A timeline is basically perfectly suited to a small screen with a scroll wheel, after all.MapsThe official Maps app offers directions and navigation on the wrist, with a mini-map view that provides just enough context to help you get around in unfamiliar settings without having to hold out your phone while you wander.PhotosThe native Photos app on the Apple Watch has a navigation system and general UX thats in keeping with the experience both on your iPhone and iPad, and now on the desktop via the upcoming Photos app. Apples Watch screen is actually surprisingly well suited to pictures, despite its small size.FacebookThe Facebook app is another one that makes perfect sense on the wrist, given that a lot of FB interaction on smartphones probably comes via notifications these days. If were lucky, FB on the wrist will mean less time spent falling into Facebook holes so to speak, where you open the app to address something specific and then end up aimlessly browsing, without any memory of why you dove in to begin with.These are just a few of the apps announced or previewed so far, and WatchAware has over 60 in total to check out, so be sure to head over there and try out some others if youre after a deeper look at what Apple Watch will be like from a software perspective.
