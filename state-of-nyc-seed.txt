If youre wondering about the seed-stage investment landscape in New York City, a new report from NextView Venturescould be a good place to start.Pulling data from a number of sources (including AngelList, CrunchBase andMattermark), NextView principal Tim Devane found that there were 175 seed-stage deals (defined as rounds of less than $4.5 million) in New York City last year, representing a total investment of $291 million. That represents 3 percent of all the venture money putinto NYC companies in 2015, but 24 percent of all deals.The report also breaks the investments down into four broad categories  consumer goods and services, food logistics, media and publishing, and financial technology.On the consumer goods side, Devane said there was a Warby Parker effect, with brand- and convenience-first consumer products getting increasing funding over the past few years. In fact, he said investors have put $155 millioninto the sectors seed dealssince January 2014, compared to the lone $1.5 million roundfor Warby Parker back in 2011.The New York market can be a trap for food and meal delivery startups as the population density can create outsized order and revenue growth that is difficult to replicate in additional cities as the company expands, he told me via email.Devane, by the way, is based in New York City, even though NextView is headquartered in Boston.
