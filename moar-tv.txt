Are there just too many TV shows right now? You may remember thats whatFX Networks CEO John Landgraf told reporters and critics over the summer  that theres simply too much television.Well, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings doesnt agree. In fact, when he was asked about Landgrafs comments today while on-stage at The New York Times DealBook conference, Hastings said, Hes wrong. Theres not nearly enough.To back that up, Hastings pointed to the broader growth of consumer spending on entertainment, which he said has been growing faster than disposable income for decades.We have a lot of choice, but I think if you do great content, youre going to find viewers, he said. At the same time, The bar is definitely rising, theres no question about it.Of course, hes making these comments as Netflix continues to ramp up its original programming. So one of the audience members, Showtime CEO Matt Blank, asked how he plans to address the challenge of maintaining quality as Netflixproduces more shows.Hastings pointed to the recent launch of Narcos as an example where an American company (Netflix) worked with a French company (Gaumont) to film a show in Bogot, Colombia  and then distributed that show to a global audience.We need to go beyond the normal spectrum to get quality, he said. Im hopeful that over time we can make a great Bollywood show, thatwe canmake a great anime show.Hastings also clarified recent comments hed made suggesting that Netflix might start competing with Vice and get into the news business. He said he was thinking about Chelsea Handlers upcoming TV show: Its a talk show about entertainment  Its not really breaking news, its creating news and doing interviews.Another audience member asked Hastings what his strategy would be running one of the major media companies/TV networks. Hastings replied that the focus has to be on TV everywhere strategies that bring network content to multiple devices  thats what hes always been most scared of.Yes, some of the subscription networks like HBO and Showtime have done a good job here, but Hastingssaid, The big system has to figure out TV everywhere.
