Maybe youvedelighted in reading some of Hillary Clintons more humorous emails, released in several stages over the past year  theres the one where she calls Harriet Tubman her home girl, or the time she jokes about Chinese hackers messing with her contacts.But imagine someone digging into your old emails and reading through all your bad jokes, family feuds and business arrangements. Its not so funny anymore, right? Heres the thing  law enforcement officials can read through your old emails anytime without a warrant.The House Judiciary Committee made its first move to fix this legal loophole today, voting 28-0 to approve the Email Privacy Act. The bill would require officials to obtain a warrant before reading Americans old emails (and texts, instant messages and other cloud-stored communications). If the Email Privacy Act continues to progress through Congress, it will amend the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which allows law enforcement (withasimple subpoena)to read emails that are more than180 daysold.Thevote is the first major move toward reforming ECPA, a 30-year-old law that governs digital communications and differentiates between data stored on a computer or other device and data stored in the cloud. Now that cloud storage is more common, it no longer makes sense to allow unfettered access to emails and messages stored in the cloud.This legislation is a long overdue remedy to the loopholes in ECPA that treat data stored in the cloud differently than data stored on a local computer, said Information Technology and Innovation Foundation vice president Daniel Castro, whose organization has supported the bill. Americans expect that their data will receive Fourth Amendment protections regardless of the means used to store it, and this legislation will help bridge that divide.After todays vote, theres still a long path to victory for the bill, which will need to passseveral more votes and receive the presidents approval before becoming law. However, with 314 representatives already signed on as co-sponsors, the bills chances look pretty good.Today is a great day for not only the Fourth Amendment advocates who have fought long and hard to move theEmail Privacy Act, but also for all Americans, who are one step closer to having private and secure digital communications, Rep. Kevin Yoder,the bills sponsor, told USA Today.
