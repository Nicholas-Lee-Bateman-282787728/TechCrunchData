JD.com has become the latest internet company in China to venture into the consumer credit space, after the NASDAQ-listed online retailer  arival to Alibaba  launched a joint venture alongside LA-based financial services companyZestFinance.The aim is to offer new microloanoptions to Chinese consumers, particularly those who not have credit history and other credentials traditionally required to land a credit card or other finance options. JD-ZestFinance Gaia, as the JVis called, will useZestFinances machine learning underwriting technology to make credit decisions based onJD.coms consumer data, which the company claimed spans 100 million monthly customers.Shengqiang Chen, JD Finances CEO, saidthe partnership will help make credit fairer for many in China:Chinese shoppers are hungry for convenient, reliable and fair credit channels.This requires both a systematic method for making decisions and a robust infrastructure that enables lenders to share data neither of which is sufficiently developed yet in China.Todays announcement with ZestFinance is a foundational step toward building a reliable system for assessing credit risk that will help meet the huge market need.The coming-together also sees JD.com made an undisclosed investment in ZestFinance, which was founded by ex-Google CIO and VP of engineering Douglas Merrill and has raised nearly $100 million from investors  including its most recent $20 million Series C round which closed in July 2013.JD.com is not the first company in China to jump into this space by any means.
