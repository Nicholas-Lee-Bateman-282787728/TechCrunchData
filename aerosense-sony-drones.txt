Sony is stepping into the drone business after the Japanese electronics giant announceda new venturethatcaptures images and other data for business purposesusing unmanned crafts.The new business  which is calledAerosense  is a joint-venture with Japanese robotics and automation company ZMP. It wont sell drones, but instead will use them to captureimages fromthe skies which  when combined with cloud-based data processing  will provide arange ofservices and data to help with tasks likemeasurement, surveying, observation and inspection.The business is due to launch in August, but it wontbeoffering services to customers until next year, the companies said.ZMP, which has develop self-driving technologies for land-based vehicles, will take a (slightly) minor stake (49.995 percent) in the business, leaving Sony  which is providingcamera tech, sensors, telecommunications, and roboticsas the majority owner.Drones are generally thought ofas fun toys for gadget lovers, but theres serious potential to simplify and enhance many processesfor businesses.There are plenty of verticals that stand to benefit from done technology.Telecom companies, for example, require precise imaging to plan new base stations and roll out other new tech. Using drones gets the job donemore efficiently, faster and withbetter results than a team of workers.That applies to a widerange of industries, including agriculture, oil and gas, town planning and highway development to name just a few.Sony and ZMP are by no means the first toenter the business side of the drone space. DJI, the multi-billion dollar Chinese company best known for its range of consumer drones, recently opened its platform to third-parties to bring benefits tobusinesses. Andy Pan, the VP who runs DJIs platform, is particularly bullish about the opportunitiesthat lie ahead.We previously said the skys the limit,but now we believe that the sky is no longer the limit,Pan told me on stage at our recent event in Shanghai.
