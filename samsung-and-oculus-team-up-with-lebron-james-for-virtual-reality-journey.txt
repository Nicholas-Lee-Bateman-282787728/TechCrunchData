On Christmas day, the world was given a gift by Oculus, UNINTERRUPTED, and LeBron James during the Warriors and Cavaliers game. The two companies paired up tolaunch a LeBron James experience in VR called Striving for Greatness with a fantastically iconic commercial for Samsungs Gear VR, a hot ticket item this holiday season.[Correction: The VR experience wasnt created by Samsung, but was used in its commercial for the Gear VR.]When the commercial came on, we didnt really know what it was about, but everyone lip-syncing Welcome to the Terrordome by Public Enemy definitely got everyones attention.The experience itself is available for download on the Oculus Store as well as the Samsung Milk VR app and follows LeBron as he trains for his 13th NBA season. It was developed by Oculus Studios, James UNINTERRUPTED, and directed by Felix & Paul Studios. Youll get about 12 minutes out of the virtual reality experience, which is a great demo of the Gear VR itself, and whats to come from the likes of the producers when they tie in iconic stars like LeBron James.2016 is going to be a hell of a year for VR. Get ready.
