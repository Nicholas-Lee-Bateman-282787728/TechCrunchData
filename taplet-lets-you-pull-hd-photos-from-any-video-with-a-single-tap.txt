The iPhone has offered the ability to take photos at the same time as you record video, but capturing photos from video that has already been captured isnt quite so straightforward.Taplet aims to solve that.The company, with $1 million in seed funding, has created an app that lets users upload HD video and then tap the perfect moments to pull HD videos. Currently, the easiest way to do this on the phone is to pause and take a screenshot, which results in a lower resolution image.Users can upload content from Dropbox and save it to their phones before digging into the app, or pull from videos taken directly on the phone by tapping into the Camera Roll. From there, simply tap to turn a moving image into a single photo, and then share those photos to various social networks like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.The most common users of the app (while its been in beta) are surfers, snowboarders and other extreme sports enthusiasts who love to capture footage with their GoPros, but dont want to share hours worth of footage. With Taplet, they justupload the footage and choose the best moments to save and share, all in HD.The team also sees parents of young children as power users, considering that its often difficult to capture a kids best moments since theyre so unpredictable.The biggest challenge is getting people to remember they dont need to always choose between recording a video or taking a photo, said co-founder Dustin Pourbaba. While weve seen many amazing photos generated with the app, there is still work to be done in convincing people that the process is easy, fun, and you get incredible results.Taplet launched out of beta recently and is available for iOS here.
