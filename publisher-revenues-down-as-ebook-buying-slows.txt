Publishing conglomerates Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster are facing tough times this quarter as ebook sales fell and total profit dropped 5.6% at S&S and approximately 12% for RPH. The potential culprits? A lack of blockbuster books and low ebook sales.While ebooks sales are still dwarfed by paperback and hardback sales, publishers are now seeing even less revenue from their recently repriced bits. Now that many ebooks are selling well above the $9.99 price that was common early in the Kindle days,Writes Publishers Weekly:These falling percentages dont seem like much  whats 1 or 2 points in a billion-dollar market? But to publishers, they are a major threat. A number of outside influences are affecting their bottom line including Amazons own publishing efforts, the rise of indie writers, and the slow but sure shrinking of the print market. The inflection point isnt quite here yet but Id expect it to hit in the next five years.Reading is changing almost daily and the publishers are trying to keep up. However, as a million mobile novelists bloom around the world and it gets easier and easier to self-publish, there is little glue to spare in order to keep the publishing house of cards stable. One puff  like a 1% drop in profit  could blow it all away.via Digital Reader
