Twitterannounced today that it has acquired Cambridge-based machine learning startup Whetlab in an effort to accelerate the companys own in-house efforts on the matter. Deal terms were not immediately available, but Twitter will gain both access to Whetlabs technology and small team following the acquisition, while Whetlabs current product will be discontinued next month, the company notes.Whetlab was developing A.I.-like technologies that would make machine learning easierfor companies to implement. Its system had been designed to get a companys internal systems off the ground automatically, and therefore, more quickly than before. This could potentially reduce the time it takes to train a new machine learning system from months to justdays.On itscompany website, Whetlab explains that their patent-pending system would offer an alternative to hiring experts to architect and tune a machine learning system in-house as is traditionally done, as it would do thiswork instead. The company even boldly claimed it did a better job than todays human experts, noting that its tech had outperformed the top machine learning researchers in configuring systems for the hardest cutting-edge problems.The tech, which was developed by researchers at Harvard, Toronto, and Sherbrooke universities, was being put to use for things like object recognition, speech processing and even computational biology. It was running in a closed beta, according to a FAQ on the Whetlab website about the planned shutdown, which is taking place on July 15, 2015. The startup, a team of five, was only around a year old at the time of the acquisition.All five team members, includingRyan Adams, Hugo Larochelle, Jasper Snoek, Kevin Swersky and Alex Wiltschko, are now joining Twitter where theyll be tasked accelerating Twitters current machine learning efforts.Whetlab, meanwhile, suggests that current beta testers download their data then migrate to other systems, likeSpearmint,SMAC, orHyperOpt, for example.Weve acquired @whetlab to accelerate Twitters machine learning efforts. https://t.co/wGXuHUc36a Twitter Engineering (@TwitterEng) June 17, 2015Machine learning technology, of course, could be put to a variety of uses at Twitter  it could learn to identify what users are posting about to enhance Twitters understanding of its user base; it could be used to improve spam detection systems; it could be used for better ad targeting; it could be used to make sense of Twitters massive data store; it could be used for recommendations and personalization; and much more.At Twitter, we understand, thecompany is focused on using Whetlabs technology for organizing and surfacing relevant content. However, the company isnt yet sharing any information abouthow the technology, more specifically, will be put to use.Whetlabs own announcement on its plans now that its joiningTwitter is fairly vague, noting only that: Twitter is the platform for open communication on the internet and we believe that Whetlabs technology can have a great impact by accelerating Twitters internal machine learning efforts.
