Mobile marketing company Tuneis releasing a new report, where24.6 percent of survey respondents said that theyd downloaded an ad-blocking app or browser.The company says it surveyed nearly 4,000 smartphone owners in the United States and Europe, and it found that adoption is growing quickly  only 2.4 percent of respondents said theyd downloaded an ad blocker in the previous four to six months, whereas 7.8 percent said theyd done sosince November 2015.Tune is projecting that ad blocking could reach 80 percent of smartphone owners by the third quarter of 2017.Some caveats here: This is a survey asking people about what theyve got on their phones, rather than data directly from their phones. (In fact, 21 percent of respondents said theywerent sure if theyd installed an ad blocker.) Plus, its still very early, withApple only allowing ad blockers on iOS last fall, so Im not sure theseimpressive growth rates will continue.And, as the report notes, just because someone has downloaded an ad-blocking app doesnt mean theyre actually using it.The report also looks into the demographics of ad blocking, but it doesnt point out any overwhelming trends. Yes, ad blockers skew slightly to young and middle-aged adults, but there are folks older than 65 who say theyve installed one. Similarly, men, Android owners and Europeans seem to bea bit more likely to try an ad blocker, but its only a difference of a few percentage points.The Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group for online advertisers, released its own ad blocking primer today, which suggests that publishers take a DEAL (Detect, Explain, Ask, and Lift or Limit) approach to ad blockers.You can read the full Tune report here.
