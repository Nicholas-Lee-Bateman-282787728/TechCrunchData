Early-stage venture firm Benchmark has added a sixth general partner to its roster: 35-year-old Scott Belsky, a former Goldman Sachs associate who went on to cofound the New York companyBehance, an online platform forgraphic designers, illustrators, photographers, web designers, and art directors to showcase their skills.Adobe acquired Behancein 2012 for more than $150 million in cash and stock, and Belsky stuck around for a little more than three years as a VP in charge of the business unit.According a newly published blog post byBenchmark Bill Gurley, Belsky came to the firms attention through hisworkas an early-stage investor and active advisor tocompanies that includeUber, Warby Parker, Pinterest and Periscope. Being in front of such big, transformative ideas at an early stage shows tremendous investment judgment, writes Gurley.In addition to Gurley and Belsky, Benchmark is run by Peter Fenton, Matt Cohler, Eric Vishria, and Mitch Lasky.The firm has a long track record of success; its most lucrative bet to date may wind up being an early investment in Uber. Benchmark led its $11 million Series A in early 2011; the company is now reportedly valued at more than $60 billion.
