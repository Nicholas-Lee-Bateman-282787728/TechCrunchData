In time for your Cyber Monday shopping, Beats has released its first portable speaker since Apple acquired the company  the Pill + wireless bluetooth speaker.Right down to the packaging,Apples influence on the products sophisticated design shines through. Opening the Pill + is a lot like unwrapping an Apple laptop or phone. Rather than the flashy colors weve come to expect from the Beats line, the Pill + only comes in white and black.Even the buttons on the speaker remind me of an iPhone. There are just four  a home button, a power button and two volume buttons.Butin addition to the sophisticated design weve come to expect from Apple, the Pill + brings the sound quality I know and love from Beats. I wear my white Beats headphones whenever Im working, but until now, Ive been disappointed by the companys speaker offerings. The Pill + allows you to share the sound quality you get over your ears with the whole party.Over the week I spent with the Pill +, I had the opportunity to test everything from cry-worthy Adele tracks to up-beat Christmas carols. The quality seemed great whether it was hip hop or alternativerock, but there was a noticeable improvement when I switched from my Spotify account to Apple Music.Operating the Pill + from your phone is very seamless. You simply connect through the Beats Pill + app via Bluetooth. The app sports a DJ feature that makes it easy for friends to also play songs.My only complaint with the Pill + as a portable speaker is that its a bit heavier than some other models Ive tried. At 1.5 pounds, its not something I would want to carry with me all day. However for its size, its sound is powerful.If youre looking for a great gadget for your holiday wish list, the Pill + could be for you. It retails for $220.
