It started with a single, encrypted message to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, and what it has become is, quite simply,the biggest leak of private documentsyet seen on the Internet.All day, the Internet has been abuzz with stories culled from the Panama Papers  roughly 2.6 terabytes of documents, related to hundreds of thousands of offshore companies, leaked from a small, relatively unknown Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca.While the Panama-based firms name may be unrecognizable to many, its client list links topoliticians, celebrities, athletes, and organizations that have been at the center of global scandals.Among the stories to hit the papers based on revelations from the Panama Papers are pieces on Vladimir Putins $1 billion in offshore holdings; the Prime Minister of Icelands shady dealings with a private company, which served as a tax haven for his private wealth; and no corruption scandal would be complete without mentioning international soccers governing body, FIFA, whose members also appear in the documents.German authorities had known about the connection between Mossack Fonseca and some criminal elements for at least two years. A whistleblower at the firm had sold information to the authorities, according to the story in the Suddeutsche Zeitung on the history of the Panama Papers leak.As part of the investigation several European banks were fined and some information was shared with authorities around the world.But the current leak dwarfs anything that has been seen before including WikiLeaks State Departmentcablesand Edward Snowdens NSA revelations. Working with the International Consortiumof Investigative Journalists, the Munich paper has marshaled the resources of at least 100 reporters from news outlets around the world to comb through the documents and uncover what they can.In a video describing the leak, Bastian Obermayer, of the Suddeutsche Zeitungs investigative team, said thatLe Monde, the BBC, andThe Guardianare also involved.I would say, first observation, its a lot more promising than even some of the more, other projects that weve done that have turned out to be very, very big, said Gerard Ryle, a director at the ICIJ.Heres a breakdown from the BBC on what the documents contain:Information from the documents reveal business dealings of some of the worlds most notorious dictators, autocrats, and authoritarians including former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, Libyas toppled dictator, Muammar Gaddafi and Syrias president Bashar al-Assad.The sheer number of people involved is becoming clear to us, says Frederik Obermaier, from the Suddeutsche Zeitungs investigative group. There are dictators, members of the Japanese Yakuza mafia, the Sicilian mafia, the Russian mafia, weapons dealers, drug dealers, and pedophiles. You start to feel a little nervous when you realize this one leak is going to expose all of them and that it all started at the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
