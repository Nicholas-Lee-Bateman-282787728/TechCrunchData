Less than a day after it emerged that Amazon is quietly droppingdevice encryption support for its Fire OS devices, the U.S. firm has flip-flopped and said that it will restore the feature.Yesterday we reported that Amazon will continue to encryptdata transfers from Fire tablets to external servers, but contentstored locally on Fire OS devices wouldnot be protected in the same way. That situation will only be temporary, however, Amazon said.We will return the option for full disk encryption with a Fire OS update coming this spring, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch via email.Amazon actually made the decision to drop on-device encryption some time back, claiming that it was a feature that few of its users took advantage of, but it only came to light this week. The move isnaive at best, or down-right irresponsibleat worse, sincethe overwhelming majority of customers are unlikely to be aware of the feature, let alone its importance to them and their personal information.As TechCrunchs Natasha Lomas pointed out, removing on-device encryptionmeansthat law enforcement agencies and other authorities caneasily obtain a users information or dataright from their device. Thats exactly the kind of situation that Apple is battling to prevent right now, stressing that the FBI order to open the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters sets a dangerous precent that tramples on privacy and safety for millions of users.Over the past week, Apples fighthas gained thesupport ofa range of tech companies and figures  including Amazon  in addition to the UN and, somewhat unexpectedly, the former heads of the NSA and Homeland Security, both of whom made public statementsin support of encryption technology.
