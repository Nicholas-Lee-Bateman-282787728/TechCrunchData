Audio streaming platform SoundCloud,nowon the road to monetizing more of the tracks on its platform through ads and paid subscriptions, is adding a key partnership into the mix to help track what gets played and when: itis now working with Zefrto identify content posted and listened to on the platform.Todays announcement is light on detail  Zefr notes in a statement that theaim is to better understand the sharing of content on the platform. Weve sent several questions both to Zefr and SoundCloud asking about how the partnership will work, and whether others in the rights management spacelike Kobalt might also get involved. We will update as we learn more. But what is more clear is that its being put in place more generally as part of alarger revenue push.SoundCloud is continuing its evolution as a mature platform for labels and advertisers, said SoundCloud co-founder and CEO, Alexander Ljung, in a statement. Working with Zefr, SoundCloud is taking another step to becoming the powerhouse player in the digital audio business.This partnership is important for both Zefr and SoundClouds businesses.Zefr made its name as a partner of YouTubes, where it trackshow both authorized and unauthorized content areposted on the video network. Its flagship services,Content ID and Brand ID, identifynot just music and film streams but also products like Coke. Altogether, working with brands like Nascar and labels like Sony, Zefr says it tracks 275 million videos online and over 31 billion video views a month.In fact, YouTube hadreally been Zefrs onlymajor streaming platform partnerup to now. But whenZefr picked up a $30 million round of funding last year from IVP, the plan was to use the investment tap into the growing worlds of media streaming and social media to work with others beyond Googles video property. SoundCloud is the first new partner its announcing  among others that have yet to be named, we understand.Its a fitting precedent, considering that SoundCloud has been described as YouTube for audio.SoundCloud has disclosedjust over $123 million in funding to date, and last reported in 2014 that it had 175 million active users. At its current rate of growth, it is likely to have more users today.However, it has also been racking up high costs as it has grown, according to the last accounts it filed in the UK, where the business is registered.In its2013 filings,Soundcloud postedturnoverof11.2 million ($14.1 million), up 40% from 2012s revenues of 8 million. But its operating loss in the period more than doubled, to 23.1 million ($29.2 million) in 2013 from 12.4 million in 2012.This likely meansthat the company islooking for more investment. Indeed, there are reports that its raising $150 million at the moment at a $1.2 billion valuation. But it also points to why SoundCloud is adding more tech into its monetisation strategy.Having a tracking partner like Zefr is likely also to help with SoundClouds negotiations with primary content owners. Currently, Warner Music is the only major label that has announced a content licensing deal with SoundCloud. While thismeans that Warner may bethe only labelmaking money from SoundCloud streams, itpotentially raises the question of whether others might pull or withhold content from the service.Zefr has been a leader in rights management for half a decade. SoundCloud is a vibrant platform where the fans are sharing content and finding the right ways to use that fan activity for the benefit of SoundCloud, its music label partners, and publishers. We are excited to use our technology and expertise to help make SoundCloud a go-to platform for content creators and advertisers, said Zach James, co-founder Zefr, in a statement.While SoundCloud may be small in comparison with the scale of YouTube, it has proven to be a very sticky platform, wheremore than 12 hours of music and other audio are uploaded every minute.
