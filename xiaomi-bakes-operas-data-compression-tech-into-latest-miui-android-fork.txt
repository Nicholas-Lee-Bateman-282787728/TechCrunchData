Xiaomi may be best known for its competitively priced smartphones, which have soaked up marketshare in China at the expense of Samsung and other Androidmakers, but it also has its own version of Android. Today, the Chinese company unveiled a newiteration of its MIUI platform, which was first created back in 2010 before Xiaomi had begun selling phones and now counts 150 million users.The standout feature of the global edition of MIUI 7  which launches in beta onAugust 24 and still looks a lot like Apples iOS is probably a partnership with Opera which, the companies claim, will compress mobile data usage in browsers and other apps by as much as 50 percent. The feature makes use of Operas Max technology  which now works withYouTube and Netflix videos  andis baked into MIUI 7 under the Data Saver feature. Also filed under performance, Xiaomi claimed that the newest version of its software can help apps run up to 30 percent faster,while consuming 10 less battery life.Thats about the only major addition, and thisdefinitely feels more iterative than previous MIUI updates.In terms of design, Xiaomi has thrown in a number of new tweaks that it said makes its softwaremore malleable than ever. Showtime lets users assign a five-second looping video to each contact, which plays when they call,an image of the day feature showcases different picson the lockscreen, while a new XXL font size is forthose who moan thattext on their phone isnt large enough.Record 5 sec vid loops and have them appear on your friend's phone with Showtime. Cool huh? #MIUI7 pic.twitter.com/XQ5xx4vHl5 Mi (@xiaomi) August 19, 2015As a parent, Id be pretty impressed if Xiaomis Baby Album feature, which uses facial recognition to organize photos of a child in a dedicated album, works as the company claimed. Other MIUI additions include four new system UI designs and tighter integration with Xiaomis Mi Band wearable.In another show that Xiaomi is prioritizing India as its lead global (read: not Chinese) market, the global MIUI launch was held in New Delhi  the Chinese version of MIUI was unveiled earlier this month and many of these new features will roll out to Indian users first. Xiaomi is, of course, now making smartphones on-the-ground in India, and earlier this year the Mi 4i became its first device designed for Indian consumers.
