Ithasnt said how many are from India, the cost of Netflix is higher than local rival services,butthe countryis clearly a huge opportunity given the billion-plus population while theres also a significant overseas diaspora, which ispegged at 16 million worldwide.The first Indian production will beSacred Games, based on a 2006 best-sellerfromVikram Chandra focused on Indias criminal underworld. Netflix said the title will be shot in India and produced in collaboration with local firmPhantom Films.
