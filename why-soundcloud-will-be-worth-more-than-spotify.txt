This latest deal provides SoundCloud with 50 percent coverage among the Big Four Warner Brothers also has a deal with SoundCloud; Sony BMG and Sony/ATV are still holding out.The Universal deal,in addition to SoundClouds latestround of funding, is a strong indicatorthat the Berlin-based music-contentplatformis a serious competitive threat to Spotify.WhileSoundCloudusually gets much less media buzz than Spotify, you wouldnt know it based on theirnumbers. First, while bothSoundCloudand Spotifyhave large user bases,Spotifyhasonly75 million active userscompared toSoundCloudsmore than 175millionmonthlylisteners.Why doesSoundCloudhave twice as many registered users?Spotify is more of a paid service for streamingmusic.The total number of users matters less to Spotify than how many of them are willing to pay.In contrast,SoundCloudis less focused on monetization(for now) and can afford to provide free content in the name of growth.Second,SoundCloudhas much better unit economics than Spotify. Why? SoundClouds producers, theusers uploading content,are thereto build a followingandarenot as focused on monetization.The agreement with Universal simply wards off any potential lawsuits over copyright infringement.In contrast, Spotify pays out80 percent of its revenueto content license holders.As thisstatsuggests,the Spotify andSoundCloudbusiness models are radically different.SoundCloudhas a platform business modelwhere its content is created by itsnetwork ofusers, not acquired through licensing deals.ForSoundCloud, the more audio producers that join the network, the more listenerswill want tojoin.Thisincrease in users,in turn, incentivizes more creativesto post their musicor podcastsonSoundCloud,and thenetwork effectscontinueto buildfrom there.In contrast,Spotify isprimarily areseller of music inventory owned by record labels and publishers. Its simply a distributor for thelatest releases, sort of like aWalmartfor music streaming. Most of the songs on Spotify you could find on Apple Music, Pandora or another streaming service.As a result, Spotify lacksthe network effects thatSoundCloudenjoys.Considerthe difference between YouTube and Netflix.Thedistinctionisthesame here, but with music rather than video content. Given Netflixs relative success, you might think this is a favorable comparison for Spotify, but it isnt.YouTube is valued at $85 billion,ortwo times the value of Netflix.And you only needto understandone number to know why: Netflix will spend more on content in 2016 thanany ofCBS, Viacom, Time Warner or Fox. Like Spotify, the vast majority of what Netflix earns goes to license owners.If you dig deeper, this analogy makes a lot of sense. Just like Netflix,creatives dontbuild their own following onSpotify. Instead,they get famous onSoundCloud, just as the best users do on YouTube.FettyWapstarted as aSoundCloudsensation before dominating thebillboard charts.DJ titansDiplo andSkrillexeachbuilt their presence and notoriety by remixing already famous songs onSoundCloudandusing theirfollowingas a jumping off point to produce original music.This also helps explain whySoundCloudhas a much better relationship with itscreativesthan Spotify seems to.Additionally,finding newsongsand podcastsis an important part of the listening experience. Buton Spotify,most of the music is content you can find elsewhere.Themajority of Spotifys content comes from major record labels and is freely available on other streaming services, like Apple Music or Pandora. But if you want to find the latest hot tracks outside of the mainstream, youll only find them onSoundCloud.SoundCloudis increasingly becoming aplace where users can discoverunique content, such asnew music and new artists. Userscan followeach other,which allows you tofind music based onanother users musicaltaste and preferences. The platform provides a simple like-and-repost feature, whichexposestroves and troves ofactivitythatenablesdiscoveryby other users. Once youfind an artistyoulike onSoundCloud,you can thensee which songsthatartist likesand get lost in a rabbit hole of music awesomeness.Thiskind of musicalserendipityis very specific to SoundCloud because of the platforms unique content.This unique content givesSoundCloudnetwork effectsthatimprove everydayasmore and more new artists(who arent ready for Spotify)and content producersupload their content. While the inventory on Spotify is finiteand expensive,SoundCloudhas the potential forYouTube-likehyper growth.As long as the platform continues to attract talented new artists and content producers, its future is very bright. Spotify, on the other hand,may struggle to stay profitable. Like Netflix before it,Spotifyfaces a continual fight with rights ownersoverits streamingrevenue.At the same time, other popular streaming services will provideconstant competition.If I had to bet on oneof the twocompanies today, Id pick the YouTube ofAudio.
