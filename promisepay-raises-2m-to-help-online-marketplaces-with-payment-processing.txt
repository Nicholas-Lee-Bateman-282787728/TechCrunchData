One of the biggest issues with online marketplaces is that buyers and sellers rarely know or trust one another, which often leads to disputes between thetwo parties.PromisePayaims to fix this issue by providing marketplaces with a payment platform to manage theentire transaction.The company just announced that it has raised an additional $2 million from strategic investors like Mark Harbottle (co-founder of popular design marketplace 99designs), andCultivation Capital (ledby Jim McKelvey, co-founder of Square).PromisePays solution allows marketplaces to ditch an in-house payment solution, essentially outsourcing the entire process. Marketplaces can easily integratefeatures likedispute resolution, escrow, and advanced fraud detection.These are all features that would traditionally require a large IT investment, as well as a dedicated customer service team to handle payment disputes. PromisePay believes that, by outsourcing the payment process, its service can save marketplaces a sizable amount of money, while alsoimproving and and simplifying the customer service experience.While the company hasnt announced all of its current clients, two big online marketplacescurrently utilizingthe PromisePay platform are Flippa and Jobstream.Originally founded in Australia, PromisePaymigrated to St. Louis to participatein SixThirty, a FinTech accelerator located in the city. While the companymoved back to Australia after the program ended, some of this new funding will be used to open an office location in St. Louis, andexpand theteams at its existing offices in Melbourne and San Francisco.Reinventure, a VC fund backed by Westpac (one of the largest banks inAustralia with over $770 billion in assets) is also participating in the round.
