Flatiron School, an accelerated educational program for web and mobile development, is switching up its model with the launch of Learn Verified.Traditionally, the Flatiron School has taught courses in real classrooms, with 99 percent of adult graduates finding a full-time job in development with an average salary of $70,000. But beyond that, Flatiron has also expanded its curriculum to schools by licensing out the program itself, as well as signing on with schools to teach after-school classes, etc. through its own training staff.But with Learn Verified, Flatiron is now offering a full online curriculum for the first time. With Learn Verified, users can complete their coursework at their own pace, and Flatiron guarantees that graduates of the program will receive a full-time job offer within six months of completing the program or they will get their money back.The curriculum, which is open-source, is the same program that Flatirons IRL students go through, and is constantly being updated to reflect the feedback of the entire Flatiron School community, ranging from teachers to students to graduates.The Learn Verified curriculum includes 600 to 800 hours of web development content, more than 200 code labs, and more than 100 videos, readings and interactive quizzes. To complete the program, students must have two mini-assessments with an instructor to check progress throughout the course, and a final verification with an instructor at the very end of the course.The whole time, Learn Verified students with have access to Flatiron School faculty for 18 hours/day and access to their fellow Learn Graduate student community 24/7.Flatiron has hiring partnerships with companies like Google, Etsy and Kickstarter and will look to place Learn Verified graduates in a reasonable web or iOS development position near to where they live.The Flatiron School has never been for the computer science hobbyist, and Learn Verified pricing reflects that. The program costs $1000/month and should take between four and six months to complete.NYC-based Flatiron School has to date raised a total of $14.5 million in funding.You can check it out Learn Verified for yourself right here.
