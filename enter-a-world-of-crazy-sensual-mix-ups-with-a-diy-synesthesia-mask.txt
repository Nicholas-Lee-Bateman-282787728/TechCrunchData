Synesthesia, aka the mixing of the senses, is a super power to be feared. But while many synesthetes have boring talents  imagining numbers as colors, for example  this DIY hack lets you turn color into scents, thereby unlocking the rainbow of potential fruit flavors.Created by Zachary Howard, the system works by reading colors on various surfaces and then responding with a certain smell. A fan wafts the smell over the users face and you can set up smells for various colors. From the Instructable:The system uses an Intel Edison board and tiny servos to squirt scent into your face. A little hand sensor allows you to read colors on various surfaces and a built-in camera turns each pixel color into a scent. You could, for example, set red to roses and blue to violets and then swipe a subway map for a big explosion of flowery scents.Its a fun and easy project and could turn you into a mutant, hell-bent on the destruction of mere mortals and dedicated to the eradication of Professor X and his X-Men. Fun weekend project either way.
