Twitters Head of Product Kevin Weil told attendees atCode/Mobilethat Twitter would absolutely remain an independent company aftertanking stocks prompted rumors earlier this year the company may sell.Weil stepped into the hot seat with Kara Swisher at Code/Mobile andsaidthe storm was calming at Twitter justa day after the company launched its new feature Moments, which aims to open the platform by bringingreal-time news to users.Twitter also announced earlier this week that founder Jack Dorsey, who had been acting as interim CEO for the past four months, would stay on full time.But according to Weil, that wont be much of a change.Therewas no way in which he acted like an interim CEO, Weil said.Though Weil had lots of praise for Dorseys return, he wouldntsay jack about whether or not the company would drop its 140-character limit  even after Swisher pressed him multiple times.Weilalso addressed one of the biggest complaints from frequent Tweeters. From Kim Kardashian to everyone with poor spelling, manyhave wondered why Twitter doesnt allow you to edit your Tweets. Weilsaid the company has no timeline for introducing the ability to edit Tweets because it would allow users to change the meaning of Tweets, which could be particularly problematic when theyre embedded or linked to in other places.Though he could not comment on these rumored short term developments, Weil did share visions for the future of Twitter, which is to bring you news as it breaks where you need it  even if thats not on your phone or computer screen.If we can tell you whats happening in your world right now, why wouldnt you want that in your car? Weil said.
