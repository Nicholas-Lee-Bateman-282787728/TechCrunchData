Amazon announced this morning that its making restaurantdelivery an option via its one-hour delivery app Prime Now. The news confirmsearlier reports which indicatedAmazon was staffing up a new restaurants division to compete with services like GrubHubwith hires in both Seattle and New York. However, the new food delivery service is initially debuting in select Seattle ZIPcodes, with plans to expand to additionalneighborhoods, then later, to new markets where Prime Now operates.The service will allow Amazon Prime members to view the menus from participating restaurants, and place orders in the app. Similar to the order-tracking available today in Prime Now, customers will also be able to track their food delivery order in real-time as its prepped by the restaurant then as the driver hits the road, heading their way.Amazon says that customerswill see their food delivered within an hour or less with no additional charges ordelivery fees.Thats slightly different from howPrime Now workstoday, which involves free two-hour deliveries but a $7.99 fee for one-hour deliveries. In fact, the company notes that the food delivery serviceslack of fees in general, as well as the fact that its not marking up the prices for restaurant menu items, will be a competitive advantage.The company also says that, for its restaurant partners, the service will allow them to tap into Amazons best customers  that is, those who pay $99 per year for Amazon Prime and who maintain payment information in Amazons Wallet.At launch, Prime Now is working with dozens of local restaurants on a rev-share basis, includingCactus, Wild Ginger, Skillet, Marination Station, Re:public, Caf Yumm, Ten Mercer, Mamnoon and many more. But while there are no larger chains working with the company today, Amazon says thats still an option. However, the company did indicate that it has a high bar for which restaurants its choosing to offer through its Prime Now service, which hints that it may be trying to compete on restaurant quality over breadth.The announcementfollows recent sightingsof online job listings on LinkedIn and Amazons own jobs site which noted that the company was seeking employees for a dedicated division called Amazon Restaurants in Seattle and New York. In addition, TechCrunch previously reported the company was testing a GrubHub competitor last year, and it popped up within Amazon Local in December.While Amazon hasnt yetannounced plans to launch the service in New York, it does seem like an obvious next market to target  especially because the company already has Amazon Restaurants employees in that location.The Amazon Restaurants division, which grew out of Amazon Local starting back in May, also includes staff from that operation. Amazon declined to give a total head count, however. But thecompanytoday workswith delivery service providers forPrime Now, though it doesnt specify which services.Amazon Local did a lot of great work with restaurants, and this kind of came out of that  learning and growing from there, and seeing a great opportunity to partner with Prime Now, explainsGus Lopez, a 17-year Amazon vet, andGM for Amazon Restaurants, on how the food delivery service got its start.We learned from working with local restaurants, and one of the big things thats needed  and that we feel like we can do well  is a delivery service.That origin story for Amazons food delivery service sounds a lot like Groupons To Go service, whichlaunched in Chicago starting in July. And along with Groupon, Prime Now will also compete with other food delivery services like Seamless/GrubHub, UberEats, food delivery offered by Postmates, as well as a variety of tech startups and traditional delivery services in the major metro areas which offerPrime Now. That list today includesAtlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Indianapolis, Manhattan, Miami, Portland and Seattle, in the U.S.Starting immediately, Prime Now food delivery is available in select Seattle zips, including the South Lake Union neighborhood, Downtown Seattle, Belltown, and parts of Capitol Hill. Being Amazons hometown has its advantages, it seems  Prime Now customers here can also order alcohol as of last month.
