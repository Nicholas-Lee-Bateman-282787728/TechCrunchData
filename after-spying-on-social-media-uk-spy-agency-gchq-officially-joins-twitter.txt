Its a sign of our massively surveilled times thatspy agencies have realized the importance of maintaining an approachable public face in the digital realmwhere they now derive so much of their signal noise.GCHQ, the UK spy agency which specializes in garneringintelligence from communications (as opposed to, MI5 and MI6, which focus on acquiring domestic and foreign human intelligence, respectively) has officially joined Twitter  posting a Hello, world inaugural tweet from its blue check verified account.Its the first of the UKs three agencies to start tweeting.Hello, world. https://t.co/SROtSsE8KB GCHQ (@GCHQ) May 16, 2016In an accompanying press release, the agency says:We want GCHQ to be more accessible and to help the public understand more about our work. We also want to reach out to the technical community and add our voice to social media conversations about technology, maths, cyber security, and other topics where we have a view.We will be using Twitter to talk about our history, mission outcomes, languages, maths, cyber security, technology and innovation, job opportunities and as a way of signposting events, publications, news, blogs, and opinion pieces.Since NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed the extent of secret government mass surveillance programs, back in 2013, includinghow they plug into consumer digitalservices to harvest massive volumes of data on web users, spy agencies have clearly decided they need to up their PR game as a strategy to tacklegreater levels ofpublic scrutiny beingapplied towhat were previously very shadowyprocesses.Lurking in the shadows after youve been judgedto be involved inillegal cross-border data-sharing activities, for example especiallywhen the government is in the process of updating the legislation that governs your operationsisnt quite so viable as it was, back when securityagencies leveraged obscure clauses in outdated lawsto amass vast quantities of data on citizens who are not suspected of any crimeswithout proper parliamentary or public oversight. Because who can scrutinize what they dont know about or fully understand?Joining Twitter is just the latest post-Snowden PR move from UK spy agencies. Back in September, for example,the chief of MI5 dida live broadcast interviewon BBC Radios The Today program  the first time a standing head of any of the UKs intelligence services had done so  in which he urgedtechnologycompanies todo more to helpsecurity agencies by pro-activelyhanding overintel on their users. So applying political pressure on tech platforms isanotherbranchof the strategy here.The Snowden disclosures have certainly forced more public debate of state investigatory powers globally, although it is debatable how robust this debate is able to begiven the ongoing obfuscation and contradictionfrom governments and agencies around key issues such as the legality of encryption.But one thing we are certainly getting is a perception of increased openness as spy agency burnish their public image by doing things like opening up official social media accounts. Hello world indeed.If you wanted a littleproof of GCHQssocial media fueled PR agenda you need look no further than the fact one of the (currently) 28 other accounts the official GCHQ Twitter account is following is the official account of the fictional British spy James Bond.Clearly the glitzy Bond movie franchise continues to bea cornerstone of theUKspy agencies win-the-publics-hearts-and-mindsstrategy.And no, GCHQ is not (yet) following @Snowden whopopped upofficially on Twitter back in September last yearto provide a public counter-narrativeto state masssurveillance spin.Joining social media is also likely to be part of the agencys outreach attempts toattract newrecruits from different demographics that might be more comfortable communicating on social media.Last November, giving a speech at GCHQ, UK chancellor George Osborneannounced a plan to double government spending on cyber security  including adding 1,900 new staff across the three intelligence agencies.
