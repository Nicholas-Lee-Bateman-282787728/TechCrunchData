Is Smule being a bully? Or is it just mounting a reasonable defense of its intellectual property?In a nutshell, those are the questions I was trying to answer during interviews withSmule CEO Jeff Smith, and with Mike Allen and Mark Godfrey, the former employeesbeing sued by the company.Heres the context: Smule makes music apps including Sing! Karaoke. Allen and Godfrey both left the company last year, and then, this summer, launched Shred Video, a service that takessports footage from a users GoPro or iPhone camera and turnsit into 90-second clips, synced to music from the users iTunes library.Now Smule is suing Shred, alleging that its founders violated their employment agreementsand illegally retained Smule property.In a blog post, Allen denied using any of Smules intellectual property for Shred, and accused Smith of employinga classic siege strategy: use Smules money and the legal process to make it hard for us to fundraise, and bleed us until we surrender. Y Combinator partner Geoff Ralston (Shred was incubated at YC)published a post of his ownwhere he admitted that he cannot know whether Shred actually stole code from Smule or not, but he said Smule seems to be neither honest nor sincere in their efforts to resolve this.Smith, on the other hand, argued that while painting Smule as a bully makes for a good story, its not supported by the facts. He said hes not trying to squasha potential competitor. After all, hes invested in startups founded by former employees (albeit ones that are less competitive with Smule)  and hes been in a similar situation himself, having left Frame Technology in the 1990s to start Tumbleweed Software.So instead, Smith said the case is really about setting a precedent.We cant accept ex-employees retaining access to our IP and source code, he said. And worse, we cant accept a precedent where said ex-employees would retain access while building a related product.Both companies said theyve actually offered to resolve the situation by having someone inspect Shreds code  the question is who would do the inspecting. Smith said it needs to be a Smule employee, not the third party that Shred is pushing for. At the same time, he also said a third party inspection would be more acceptable than the Black Duck scanthat Shred had previously proposed.We would have been amenable to that before theyhad access to our code for nine months, he said. Now were concerned that the contamination is potentially more serious, so we would want somebody whos more of an expert in the field [to look at it].In other words, Smith is saying that Shreds extended access to Smule code could have given them time to hide any potentially infringing activity  something a Smule employeewould be better equipped to spot.I can see that its a higher standard than the one theyre proposing, but I dont think its an unreasonable standard, and it would provide reasonable protection to both companies, Smithsaid.Allen countered that Smiths claims about the shortcomings of a third-party audit are preposterous, and disingenuous. He insisted that aknowledgeable, accreditedthirdparty could review whatever version of Shred Videos code they want, and verify whether it had any Smule IP.He added,Giving Smule our code is the equivalentof Smule asking us to let them play judge and jury, and trust that they would deal with us fairly. With all the evidence of bad faith on Smules part  this is of course an absurd expectation.Given the contrasting claims here, I was hoping that some outside observers could shed some light on whos being reasonable here. So for what its worth:Smith said this is an unusual situation because of the amount of time Shred Video has had access to Smule source code, and because the code in question came from 10years of research at Georgia Tech, Khush and Smule.There are very few who would understand [it], he said.Moving on to that evidence of bad faith: Allen pointed to a leaked recording of a company meeting where Smith discussed an unidentified legal case and said, If it goes to litigation, if were wrong, well win.In other words, comparedto Shred Video, Smule has plenty of resources (it recently raised a $26 million round, bringing its total outside funding to $68 million), which means Smulecan outlast Shred if this goes to court.Smith didnt dispute the quote, but he said that if you look at his full comment, where he describes this as not a great scenario and a big mess, its clear that hes expressing regret that the companieswerent able to resolve the situation without lawyers. He also said his comments were part of a larger discussion about why its better for employees to work out any potential IP issues before leaving the company.Smith did take issue with other things that have been written about the situation. For example, Business Insider reportedly saw an email thread where Godfrey tried to meet with Smith, but the CEO never took him up on it. Smith showed me what Im guessing is the same email thread, and while the meeting didnt happen (he said it was sidelined by a serious illness), the thread suggests that he did try to schedule a meeting or phone call.(Update: Allen pointed out that those scheduling emails were sent in May, after the lawsuit had already been filed. He sent me an earlier, pre-lawsuit thread where Smith reached out to Godfrey, who offered to meet or talk. Allen said Smith did not respond.)And while Ralston said Smule has consistently refused to identify what ideas (aside from code) might have been stolen, Smith pointed to a court memorandum outlining the companys concerns around Smule tech, including its synch technology.Code is only one example of IP, Smith said.Theres plenty more being disputed, some of it revolvingaround a laptop with Smule code. Godfrey said that Smule team membersasked him to keep the laptop so he could continue helping out (Allen and Godfrey documented several instances after Godfreys departure of Smule engineers asking him for technical advice involving Smule code), that at the time, he had no inkling he would be working on this product and that hes turned the laptop over to his lawyers, who in turn handed it over toDiscovia eDiscovery as evidence.Smith, on the other hand, said there was no reason for Godfrey to keep the laptop at all, since he declined to sign a contract to continue working for Smule as a consultant. And he said that in the ensuing months, If they had returned the laptop, the [encryption] key, and returned all source code, this never would have gone to court  it would have been much simpler to resolve.Smule deserves to know that their IP is safe and were more than willing to give them that assurance, Allen told me. Im perfectly optimistic that well find a way to make this work.Bothsides have accused the other of bad faith behavior, but both have also said theyd prefer a resolution outsidethe courts.
