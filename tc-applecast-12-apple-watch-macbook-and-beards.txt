Its Apple Watch pre-order day! The new device went on sale this morning at just after midnight Pacific time, and now shipping times are extending to at least June across the product lineup. Our guest today, The Loops Jim Dalrymple (@jdalrymple), not only successfully ordered three but also went to the Apple Store in Palo Alto to check out the in-store experience.I also managed to see the Apple Watch retail process in action here in Toronto, and experienced a try-on appointment first-hand. Jim met up with Apple CEO Tim Cook, though, so he comes out the clear winner.someone please get this hobo away from Mr. Cook  apple employee
