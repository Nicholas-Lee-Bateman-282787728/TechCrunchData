Marvel Comics just launcheda new Black Panther series, written by Ta-Nehisi Coates (thats right, the well-known journalist and author of New York Timesbestseller Between The World and Me) and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze.For those of you who arent familiarwith the character, he was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the 1960s  as a black superhero, he stood out at a time when comics were a lot whiter.White characters still dominate the superhero world, but thats beginning to change, thanks in part to Marvel characterslike the Kamala Khan incarnation of Ms. Marvel and the Miles Morales incarnation of Spider-Man.Which is great, but how does the Black Panther stand out now, when hes no longer the black superhero?Well, Stelfreeze said hes still definitely the OG of blacksuperhero characters. He also pointed out that from his debut, the character wasnoteworthy asthe king of a (fictional) African nation, Wakanda: He wasnt a prisoner, he wasnt someones sidekick or something likethat, he was introduced as a character of majesty.Series editor Wil Moss suggested that sinceBlack Panther no longer has to carry that burden of being the only black character in the line, the storycan deal more with Wakanda, its politics and how the character reacts to a rebellion that threatens his rule.What Ta-Nehisi is doing,heschargingme with makingWakandaa city that you recognize, that you can go to, Stelfreeze added. You not only get the feeling of the country, you get the feeling of the people.For a nonwhite superhero fan like me, its also exciting to see a Black Panther comic thats written and drawn by black creators. When I asked whether hiring a diverse lineup of writers and artists is important to Marvel, Moss said that itsmore about finding the right talent who can tell the best stories. At the same time, he acknowledged that for a character like Black Panther, bringing on black creators is natural and represents the comic finally catching up a bit.Marvel just wants to reflect our audience, our readership, our talent pool, he said. In his eyes,Coates wasthe right person for the job, and not just because ofhis high-profile writing about race in America: Hes definitely a guy who knows comics.Also giving the title a boost: Black Panther will be featured in the upcoming blockbuster Captain America: Civil War, and hell headline his own film in 2018.Moss said the comics are very much a separate story from the movies, but theyre alsoaiming to make the titleaccessible to new readers. (Ive read the first issue, and I thinktheyve succeeded  Coates writingis dense and complex, but it also catches you up as it goes along.)It turns out that he still thinks of comics as primarily a print medium, and he draws with print readers in mind. At the same time, Moss said that thanks to digital distribution, Black Panther could reach a lot ofnew readers.Ta-Nehisi has such a large audience outside of comics, and with digital,we can reach anybody who doesnt know where to find the comic store nearby, he said.
