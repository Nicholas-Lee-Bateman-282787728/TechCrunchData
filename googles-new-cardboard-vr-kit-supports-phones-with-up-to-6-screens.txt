Google didnt go crazy and build a brand new Cardboard VR set for I/O this year as was rumored  but it did modify the original version with tweaks designed to fit the needs of the contemporary smartphone market. The Cardboard VR kit, which is still indeed made of cardboard, now supports phones with displays up to 6-inches in diameter, meaning it will work with the Nexus 6, among other devices.
