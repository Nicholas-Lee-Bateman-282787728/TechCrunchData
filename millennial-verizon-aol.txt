AOL, recently acquired by Verizon for $4.4 billion, appears to be wasting little time in continuing to build out its advertising business. Sources tell TechCrunch that the company has been inthe process of buyingmobilead network Millennial Media.AOLstarted kicking the tires on Millennial weeks ago, one source says, but things were slowed down by AOL itself getting acquired by Verizon. The price rangeweve heard is between$300 million and$350 million, and if the deal goes through,it will be some weeks still before it gets announced.If the price weve heard is right, itwould be a premium for Millennial as it stands at the moment. The company istrading at $1.45 per share as of market close today, giving it a market capitalization of $217 million.AOL has declined to comment, and Millennial has not responded to our request for comment.Part of the reason for AOLs and Verizons interest in mobile advertising is because this is where the growth is: asthe number of smartphones and tablets has continued to expand, so has consumers usage of mobile apps and mobile web-based services. That has had a large knock-on effect on the mobile ad market, forecast to beworth $100 billion in 2016 and 51% of the digital ad market, according to eMarketer.Millennial Media was one of the many mobile ad startups to emerge out of that larger trend. While there was some significant consolidation happening  such as Google buying AdMob, Apple buying Quattro, and many other deals, Millennial stayed independent (and has even bought some others itself).Millennialsaw a 100%pop when it went public in 2012, raising $130 million and getting valued at $2 billion. It has,however, has failed to maintain thosedizzying heights.On the back of earnings that have fallen short of expectations and perhaps some skepticism about the companys longer term prospects as an independent in the face of competition from the likes of Google, Apple and Facebook, Millennialhas lost nearly 90 percent of its valuation since going public.Millennial has a bunch of good assets and some legacy bad assets, is how one observer described the company. Theyve been prepped for sale for some time.Indeed, Millennialhas been the subject of acquisition rumors before, with some of those reportssingling out AOL as a potential suitor.Anacquisition of Millennial would underscore abigger strategic moveat AOL(and now, Verizon) to continue building out its digital ads business, with more mobile services, both on the back of its own content operations (AOL/Verizon own TechCrunch, Huffington Post, Engadget and a number of other online and video properties) and for third-party publishers.Mobileis an area where both AOLand Verizon  with its vast network of 130million+ mobile subscribers on Verizon Wireless  have already been betting big. Expanding in mobile advertising in fact was seen as one of the key reasons behind the purchase of AOLin the first place.AOL already has assets in the mobile advertising space  for example, by way of Third Screen Media (which it acquired way back in 2007)  andclearly it now wants to bedoing more.There has been somespeculation over what kind of investments Verizon or AOL would be making to build out that business, but one concreteexample of how its growing can be seen in the recent outsourcing deal between AOL andMicrosoft.Announced at the end of June, AOL is taking overdisplay, video and mobile advertising for Microsofts operations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan, covering ad inventory on properties like theMSN Homepage, Outlook Mail, Xbox, Skype and ads in apps.Thatincreased activity could also be one reason why AOL would want to ramp up its business with Millennial Medias ad network.Curiously, was there someinadvertent writing on the wall about this transaction? Last week, Millennial put out this statement about equity grants to six unnamed employees as part of retention packages, being made as a material inducement to employees entering into employment with Millennial Media in connection with the acquisition transaction.
