Sleep deprivation is the undoing of startup founders, according to Arianna Huffington.There is this kind of founder myth that if you are a founder youcant afford to get enough sleep, she told me over the phone while catching a plane back to New York. The truth is three-quarters of startups failand if founders got more sleep theyd have a better chance of succeeding.Wanting to get more sleep isnt the problem for most of us. Its fitting in the recommended seven to 9 hours of sleep with work, eating, exercise, relationships and a social life  and on top of that founders need to spend a lot of time growing their fledgling company.But sleep is non-negotiable in Ariannas world  and to prove it she invited me to sleep in her $8 million Manhattan apartment sleep paradise (complete with a hot bath, candles, and luscious pillows)to get some much-needed shut-eye.Ok, not me exactly, but whoever the lucky winner is on her (now closed)Airbnb contest.I applied right under the wire and will let you know if I win (Im told Im up against Kara Swisher), but clearly Arianna is serious enough about our lack of sleep, shes willing to let strangers (and stray reporters) into her bedroom to get some zzzzz.But shes been on the sleep train for a while. Arianna wanted to install nap pods at TechCrunch several years ago. The Huffington Post and AOL (parent company to TC and HP) both have nap rooms. Sounds dreamy but never happened here.Im told I would not want to nap at AOL because people have used the space for other activities.But were working too many hours and giving up on sleep and it could be affecting Americas bottom line, says the Huffington Post founder.She rattled off half a dozen executives whod collapsed or traumatically suffered from a lack of sleep last year  including United Airlines CEO Oscar Munozand JP Morgans head of M&A Jimmy Lee (who died unexpectedly).The Huffington Post founder collapsed from exhaustion herself a few years back, leading to her sleep obsession.We now have the most amazing science that proves without doubt sleep deprivation affects every aspect of our health and our productivity, she told me.Easy for a famous, jet-setting CEO to say but proper sleep is treated as more of a luxury for many workers of the world.And there are plenty of examples of successful executives who dont need much sleep  Jack Dorsey, Donald Trump and Martha Stewart among them.These people are the genetically exceptional sleepless elite probably designed in a secret Russian space lab. But, according to science, most of us do need to spend athird of our lives uninterrupted under the covers to function.Arianna seems to be making headway among Silicon Valleys elite Shesleep-trained Ubers Travis Kalanick recently.But you dont need to win a contest or be a successful founder for some help. Ariannas new book The Sleep Revolution outlines how we can sleep better, too.The advice is obvious no caffeine after 2 pm and keep your bedroom dark and quiet  butlike exercise and eating right, a lot of us probably dont do it anyway.And sacrifices will be made  no tech in the bedroom and youmight not get through all of those critically acclaimed Netflix dramas  Arianna tells me shes only seen one episode of House of Cards because sleep is the priority.But then, maybe youll think clearly and your startup wont fail.
