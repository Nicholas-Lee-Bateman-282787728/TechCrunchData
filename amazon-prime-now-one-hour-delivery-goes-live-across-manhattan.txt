Amazon is now offering one-hour delivery in all of Manhattan.In December, the online retail giant promised one-hour delivery to a very expensive, very small zone in Manhattan. Today, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Mashable that the service is available across the entire island.The one-hour delivery program is called Amazon Prime Now, and it offers free two-hour delivery from 6am to 12am, with one-hour delivery available for an extra $7.99. Prime Now is applicable to products like paper towels, shampoo, books, toys, batteries, and other general household items.Prime Now products are available exclusively through a dedicated companion app called Amazon Prime Now.Its unclear how Amazon plans to expand the Prime Now service, but its clear that the on-demand space is infringing on Amazons two-day delivery play.Especially in New York, services like WunWun and even PostMates are offering on-demand anything at an affordable price. With Amazon Prime Now launching in Manhattan, the giant is stepping into the ring as well.
