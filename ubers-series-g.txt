Uber, the on-demand transportation company that has amassedaround $10 billion in funding to date, is raising oncemore. This time, it islooking toto $2.1 billion, in aSeries G roundthat could value the company has high as $64.6billion if all the shares are issued, TechCrunch has confirmed with a source close to the company.The fresh funding, reported first by Bloomberg, is spelled outin documents that Uber filed in Delaware earlier today. A copy of Uberslatest filingis embedded below, supplied by private market data provider VC Experts. It notes that there are43,057,291 shares of preferred Series G stock being issued at$48.772228/share. VC Experts estimatesthat the post-money valuation, if all shares are issued, couldbe between $62 billion or as high as $68 billion.TechCrunch understands from a source close to the company that Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price are a part of the current round, and that there maybe more strategic investors on the way.For all the talk of tech bubbles bursting or at approaching a soft landing, themoney is still flowing fast. Tiger Global just yesterday closed a new $2.5 billion fund, which may be the source of its stake in thislatest round in Uber.Tiger Global is an interesting partner for Uber: last year, several hedge funds affiliated with Tiger Management invested in Uberin a $1.2 billion round, although Tiger Global was not involved. Tiger Global, up to now, has been a strong investor in several Uber rivals in other markets, including Ola, Didi and GrabTaxi.Ubers focus on strategic investorsmay take some of the focus away from whatever conflict of interest may exist in investing in big rivals. Its past strategic partners have included Spotify, Times Internet of India and Baidu, all bringing interesting angles to how the company has grown over time.The Times Internet deal involves the media group providing marketing and other services to Uber specifically in India, where it is working hard to compete against local player Ola, and it was accompanied by a small investment of an undisclosed amount, the companies said when the deal was announced in March of this year.Similarly, in September it emerged that Baidu has also invested in Uber in China as part of a $1.2 billion round. Chinas search giantprovides marketing and distributionas well as mapping services to Uber in the country. Microsoft also made a strategic investment of about $100 million in Uber in its most recent round.Potential strategic investorscould figure as part of Ubers strategy for how it plans to growits business.Considering that Uber is increasingly moving into transporting more than just people, as well as providing more enhanced services to attract drivers to its platform, that could mean other delivery companies looking for a boost in their last-mile services; automotive or or vehicle businesses that might want to formleasing partnerships for drivers or potentially provide other services, such as mapping; or even businessesthat have goods that need to be moved from A to B but lack efficient delivery.The news of Ubers fundraising comes on the same day that several of its rivals  Lyft, Didi Kuaidi, Ola and GrabTaxi  have clubbed together in a new global ridesharing network, where they will share technology and link together their apps but remain separate companies focusing on their local markets as they look for better ways to compete asthe San Francisco juggernaut takes its transportation business up another gear.
