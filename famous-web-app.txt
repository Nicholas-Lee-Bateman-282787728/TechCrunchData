The Famous appgot itself banned from Apples App Store about a month ago. They sidestepped the ban by promptly launching an Android version instead, and is todayback on an iOS device near you in the form of a web app.The Famous interface, in which your correspondent is the worlds biggest fan of Twitter. Which is true on several levels.The App Store ban wasnt the first brush the company had with disaster. Before its renaissance as Famous, the game was known asStolen, and under that particular name, the companylanded itselfin a colossalcyclone of crap. The companyshut down the appwhen it became clear that you could buy and comment on profiles of people who hadnt consented to being used in such a manner, making it a high-risk zone for abuse, harassment and bullying.We need to have an around-the-clock moderation team monitoring our chat, monitoring our nicknaming, monitoring our wall posts, the Stolen team said at the time, just before shutting the service down.In its new incarnation, Famous is a fantastically addictive game that involves a surprising amount of strategy. As long as the companymanages to keep the platform clean and free of spam and abuse, itll hopefully continue going strong. The web app is very well done, but who knows? Perhaps Apple will eventually change itsmind about having banned Famous.
