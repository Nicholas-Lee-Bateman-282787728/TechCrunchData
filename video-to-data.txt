Vu Digital is launching new technology to help customers figure out whats actually going on inside videos, online and otherwise.B. Wade Smith, the companys vice president of operations and development, said that as more and more online content moves to video, it will become increasingly important to extract data about those videos in a form thats easy to analyze  namely, text.So as Smith demonstrated for me, Vu Digitals Video-To-Data product actually breaks down a video frame-by-frame, identifies the objects in each frame, and then creates a chronological transcript identifying things like music, dialogue, faces, logos, text and graphics.Whats the point? Smith suggested this could be used by anyone in the video value chain, such as creators, publishers or marketers. The data could used for things like search engine optimization, personalization, ad targeting and determining the brand value of a video, namely how long and how prominently a product or logo appeared.Vu Digital is an affilaite of C Spire Wireless, and its participating in the Sprockit accelerator for media and entertainment startups.Smith admitted that the current product comes from a pivot, but a pivot that illustrates the problem Vu Digital is trying to solve. The company started out focused on web personalization, but Smith said, We quickly found more and more website content was becoming video and we couldnt make long-tail content recommendations  the tags for the video were absolutely insufficient. So the team decided to drop everything and focus on the video issue.Other companies have built video analysis and search tools  in fact, Microsoft acquired its own video search company back in 2011. However, Smith said hes not aware of any competitors that can identify everything that Vu Digital can, nor can competitors do it with the products speed.[Video-to-Data] gives us, for the first time, a way to harness video data that will improve search results, click-through rates and traffic to our content, said Tim Kelly, senior vice president of WeatherNation, in the launch release.
