Serial entrepreneur Amanda Moskowitz has beenrunning into this problem for 10 years. Afterstarting company after company, shealways needed to consult other founders for the best software, payroll and HR tools.Today, shes launching a platform to solve this exact problem. Stacklist is a recommendation platformfor enterprise software toolsculled from interviews and surveys withentrepreneurs across the industry.Over 70 percent of the time, entrepreneurs make theirdecisions from therecommendations of trusted peers, she said.Stacklistinterviews founders that are anywhere from seed stage toSeries B. Its heavily curated and not from generally contributed user recommendations.Right now were really staying focused on making sure the quality of the input is high, she said.They have more than a hundred tools reviewed on the site in more than a dozen categories from e-mail marketing to credit card processing to HR.Stacklist comes as enterprise software has become increasingly fragmented over the last decade. Rather than relying on one massive corporationlike SAP for business intelligence, younger companies areswapping dozens of tools in and out.Moskowitz said that startups, on average, have 13.5 business tools in theirStacklists, with the most popular categories being project management and analytics.Weve gonefrom aSwiss knife, to disparate sets of tools, she said.Unsurprisingly, the most popular tool among Stacklist companiesis Slack, along with Quickbooks, Mailchimp, Google Analytics and Google Drive. But Indinero, Keen.io and Segment are also on the rise, Moskowitz said.Zendesk leads the customer service category with 40 percent of Stacklist companies relying on a customer service tool using the SanFrancisco-based companys software.There is no obvious leader inrecruitingtools, with companies likeGreenhouse, Upwork and Jazz sharing the top spots followed byWorkable and Lever. About 10 percent of all companies rely on AngelList to post jobs.With HR, the most popular tools areTrinet, Zenefits and Justworks. Zenefits leads among companies with one to nineemployees, and Trinet leads with bigger companies that are 10 to 50 employees large.
