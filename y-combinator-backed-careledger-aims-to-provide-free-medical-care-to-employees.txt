Digital health startup CareLedgerlaunched out of Y Combinator today to provide the workers of the world with free, quality medical care.Thats no small feat. The U.S. has one ofthe most expensive and least functional medical systems in the world, toppling every other country by thousands of dollars. The U.S. also ranks lower on health outcomes and quality, according to a survey from International Health Policy.There are plenty of organizations working toward lowering health care costs. YC alumniSimplyInsuredaims to reduce medical expenditures by analyzing thousands of insurance plans and coming up with the best rate for company employees. Oscar Healthclaims to provide free services after a plans out-of-pocket max. However, neither promise free, quality health care.CareLedger uses a slightly different approach with cost comparisons for highly recommended facilities. The idea is to find the best service with the lowest price under an employers health insurance coverage and then offer those recommendations to its workers.CareLedger works by choosing a physician from the startups list, based on your location or convenience and then scheduling a visit for that procedure. CareLedger doesnt send a bill after and all medical help is supposed to be free to the patient.From Left to Right: Nik Swain, Oliver Takach, Klaus MergenerThe idea sounds unbelievable  free, quality health care for employees. However, Walmart, thealways low prices superstore chain,attempts to provide low priced health care and free services to employees in much the same way. Say what you will about the big box storeand its employee practices, it supports preventive medicine coverage and up to $1000 in medical expenses for its workers.GE and Lowes also do this under the so-called Centers of Excellence, which provide coverage for selectsurgeries such as hip and knee replacements.We like to think of CareLedger as doing Center of Excellence but without travel and for more procedures and tests, co-founder Oliver Takach told TechCrunch.CareLedger still gets paid on these free procedures, but the employer only pays the startup when the startup is able to lower the cost to a point that procedures are free to the employee.This saves both the employees wallet and potentially expensive overhead for the employer.You have an average price, a set price in a geography for each procedure and then you have our price, the one that you actually pay for. Whatever that difference is, we make a percentage of that difference, Takach said. The employer doesnt actually pay us unless we lower the cost.CareLedgerclaims to save up to50 percent on average, on over 600 procedures and tests.
