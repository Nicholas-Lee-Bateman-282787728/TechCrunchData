GreatHorn, a cloud security platformfocused on stopping phishing attacks, has raised $2.25 million in seed funding led by ff Venture Capital and SoftTech VC, with participation from Techstars Ventures, RRE Ventures, Zelkova Ventures, V1.VC and investor Walter Winshall.The Belmont, Ma.-based company came together last year, as a kind of bet thatCEO Kevin OBrien and hiscofounder, Ray Wallace,made on two trends converging: the rapid adoption of cloud infrastructure for core business services likeemail, and a commensurate increase in the number of data breaches which began through those channels.Both are coming true. A fast-growing percentage of enterprises have begun to embrace both Google Apps and (for much larger companies)Office 365 for email.Meanwhile, almost alldata breachesstart via highly targeted phishingattacks.GreatHorn says its tackling the problem two ways. First, its builtdirectly into the core email platforms themselves. Forexample, it can be nativelyintegrated into Office 365 via the Azure marketplace and O365 APIs; that means no email delays when an attack is in process.According to OBrien, GreatHorn also prides itself on not trying to change user behavior as an enforcement strategy. Theres a reason why humans are the weakest link in any security system, he says. Theyre a soft target, easy to trick, and often have commercial priorities that drive different behaviors from those of the security organizations. With that in mind, the company says itprovidesactive defense, meaningitsremoving attacks where and when they happen, not simply reportingon them.Bigger picture, OBrien whose previous gigs include product marketingdirectorat the cloud security companyCloudLocksays that GreatHorn  which charges on a per-mailbox, per-month basis  has ambitions beyond being an email security startup.Given cloud computing forecasts, thats not surprising.Cloud is changing how people and businesses communicate, he says. Email is simply a medium for exchanging ideas, and wherever a medium exists, exploits will soon follow.
