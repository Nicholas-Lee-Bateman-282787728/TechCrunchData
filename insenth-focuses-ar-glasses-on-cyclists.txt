Its clear that the first version of Google Glass had an identity crisis  unless you count the Scoble shower incident. But lets just call that a crisis Oneproblem with the wearable was there was no clear consumer proposition, so no reason for the publicto want to sport thesmart specs.Google is apparently reworking Glassnow, likely with a narrower,enterprisefocus. And that makes a lot more sense. The traction that Glass had gained was for niche industrial use-cases. Mountain View is not the only company thinking this way either  Sony is also building smart specs with an enterprise bent.So while VR headsets like Facebooks Oculus Rift take aim at the gaming market, danglingthe prospectof immersive entertainment (assumingyoure able to forget what a dork you look like IRL), makers of augmented reality specs are going aftermore specific and specialized niche use-cases.To wit: meet Senth In1  a pair of AR glasses, based on Android 4.3, being developed by a Beijing-basedstartup, specifically forcyclists. The team is currently raising crowdfunds via the Indiegogoplatform with the aim ofturningtheir prototype into a shipping product. At the time of writing theyre 85 per cent funded, with just over $34,000 pledged.The glasses are being designed to work in conjunction with a thumb controller which ismounted on the bikes handlebars, enabling the wearer to control a ring-based UI that allows them to choosedifferent functions by swiping around a circle and pressing to select. The specs will alsosupport other interaction methods, including a lateral touchpad on the side of the glasses, voice control and motion-sensing head movements for UI selections.In terms of features the team is aimingto develop for their Insenth OS (atop the Android base), users will apparently be able to view their distance and speed via the glasses waveguide display, as well as link the hardwarevia Bluetooth to other sensing wearables they own to view other metrics such as heart rate or cadence; plus view maps and navigation directions as they ride; take photos and videos via an onboard camera; select and play music; and make phone calls and send voice messages.The prototype is actually the fourth developed by the team, according to co-founder Li Jiwen, the other three being professional AR glasses. But with limited funds to support ongoing R&D the team has apparently beenworking on AR glasses since 2012  he says he made the decision to narrow the focus totry developing smart specsforcycling, which was also a personal interest.The advantage of this sort of focus is of course having an established community to tailorthe tech for and market the productto, rather than attempting to sell a vague general promise of ARsbenefits. Add to that, cyclists are already used to kitting themselves out in specialist gear  and their kit isnt what the mainstream would recognize as fashionable, so theres less likely to be any stigma associated with wearing a face computer out and about.If the team meets its crowdfunding target, it says its aiming to get the Insenth In1smart specs to market starting from thisDecember  albeitthats a pretty ambitious timeframe for such a complex product (and where hardware crowdfunders are concerned its always wise to expect delays).Insenthsglasses arebeing priced at $250 to Indiegogo early birds, undercutting the price ofRecon Jets rival smart specs which are also focused on the extreme sports space.
