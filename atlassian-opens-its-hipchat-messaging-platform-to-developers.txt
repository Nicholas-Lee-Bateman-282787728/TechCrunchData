HipChat, the team chat platform Atlassian acquired in 2012, now allows developers to build apps that run directly inside its user interface.Until now, developers were only able to push inbound messages to HipChat through its existing API, and create their own custom slash commands. That was mostly on par with what HipChat competitor Slack also currently offers. HipChat Connect takes this a step further.HipChatConnect is a platform that incorporates all the context available within apps, web, mobile, presence and team messaging in a way that focuses on helping people to do their jobs more easily by taking action directly, without having to switch between apps, HipChat general manager Steve Goldsmith told me. Now withHipChatConnect, developers are able to build full app experiences that enable direct action to be taken from within the conversation.Some of the companies that have already builtHipChat Connect versions of their apps includeMeekan, New Relic, PagerDuty, StatusPage.io, and Zendesk.Goldsmith tells me that these apps can run on both the desktop and on mobile. HipChatConnect does all the hard work byabstracting the complexity for developers who want to create rich app experiences directly withinHipChatacross mobile and desktop, he said. Weve created a context-aware system that understands many different things, including if users are onmobile or desktop, presence, team context  with more to come such as location and video.Developers will be able to market their apps on the Atlassian Marketplace. According to the company, the Marketplace currently features about 2,000 add-ons and exceeded $100 million in sales since its inception three years ago.While Slack tends to get all the hype, HipChat seems to be doing quite well, too. Its currently in use by companies ranging from American Express to Marriott and Whole Foods. The company says messages sent in the app have doubled from 4 billion to 8 billion since the beginning of 2015.
