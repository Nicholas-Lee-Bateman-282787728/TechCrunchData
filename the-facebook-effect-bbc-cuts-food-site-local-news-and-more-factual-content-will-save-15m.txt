While theBBC is planningto takeon Netflix by buildingits own Britflix on-demand video streaming service,on the news front, it looks like the UK media giant is cutting back to shore up its funds and figure out a better way of competing against (or within!) Facebook.Today, the many-tentacled public broadcasterconfirmedthat it would be closing down and consolidating several apps and online properties in specific verticals like food, local news and travel, while also paring down ring-fenced budgets for original on-demand content, as it aims for a more focused and distinctive service. The BBC estimates that the cuts will take place over the next 12 months and will save it 15 million ($22 million)  or 15% of its annual editorial spend.TheBritflix report from yesterday noted that the BBC is toying with a subscription-style service for iPlayer. WhenTechCrunch asked about this, a BBC spokesperson did not respond directly to the Britflix idea but pointed to how the BBC has been developing its platform for third-party content, which it will continue to expand:Obviously S4C [a Welsh-language public broadcaster] is a channel on iPlayer already  but what were talking about is more content such as what we did with the RSC for Shakespeare, the spokesperson said.iPlayer has been one of the BBCs big successes in terms of new digital initiatives, so its not really surprising to see the company look for ways of growing it. As the same time, the company has been experimenting with more third-party content on the platform  for example during thoserecent Shakespeare anniversary celebrations so its clearly an area where it hopes to be more relevant to todays audience.And relevance seems to be the name of the game withtodays news, too.The corporationis spinning todays closures aproductof a wider review of its digital services, the Online Creative Review  as a proactive move, and says its doing it to remain at the forefront of digital broadcasting.But its also defensive: the BBChas been seeing its position in UK news viewing (and arguably world viewing) eroded over the last several years. Specifically, it now needs to respond to the rise of aggregating platforms like Facebook, which have become both go-to places for people to read news from other sites, and to find informationthat is actually only created to live and be consumed onFacebook itself.As a case in point: today the BBC says that its share of online viewing time is only around one-fifth of that of Facebooks in the UK: The online market is global and the BBC only accounts for around a 4.5% share of UK adults time online compared to Facebooks 20%, it notes.Its not the only one learning how to better reckon with the newgeneration of content consumption that is focused around social platforms. Facebook is encouraging some publishers to create content specifically for its new video push, for example. Others are raising questions about what the right cost is to get promotedon Snapchats Discover platform.The cuts will be coming in the next year, and they touch a number of popular areas, but also ones that the BBC could justify as overlapping with other parts of its operation. From the BBCs statement, these are the plans:The review  launched last fall  was led by James Harding, Director of BBC News & Current Affairs, who is taking the view that to be stronger, you have to be leaner.The internet requires the BBC to redefine itself, but not its mission: the BBCs purpose online is to provide a distinctive public service that informs, educates and entertains, he said in a statement. The Review sets out what we want to be famous for online: trusted news; the place where children come to learn and play; high quality entertainment; live sports coverage and sports news; arts and culture, history and science; and historic moments, national events. And we are going to focus our energy on these six areas: BBC News; iPlay and BBC Bitesize; BBC iPlayer and BBC iPlayer Radio; BBC Sport; the Ideas Service; and BBC Live. We will stop doing some things where were duplicating our work, for example on food, and scale back services, such as travel, where there are bigger, better-resourced services in the market.The BBC has made a number of efforts to tailor and shift its service to platforms and formats that will better capture attention in todays digital world. There have been lots of reports in the past about how it would work with companies like Spotify to develop new services, although up to now its been very intent on creating its own platforms that incorporate third-party content, rather than partnering on new platform efforts outright.Updated with more details about streaming service.
