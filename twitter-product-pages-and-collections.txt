Twitter just announced new capabilities that it says make it easier to discover products and places.The company has been moving into e-commerce and rolled out a Buy button last fall. However, a single tweet may not be the best way to sell a product, especially if you dont know much about it, so Twitter says its starting to create pages around some products to provide more information and content.Those pages will include multiple tweets, but theyll also have basic product information  and, yes, the ability to actually make a purchase. Heres an image of a sample page for Andy Weirs bestselling book The Martian.Twitters also allowing a limited group of curators, including TechCrunch, to create their own collections around different themes. For example, we tweeted a collection of 5 smart kitchen gadgets. It looks like a normal tweet with multiple images, but when you open it, you get multiple, each one talking about a different gadget. And those tweets, in turn, link to product pages.Twitters blog post describes this as a test and adds:This is just the beginning. In the coming months well be testing more new experiences we hope give you the most personalized and relevant information about the places and things you want to explore.
