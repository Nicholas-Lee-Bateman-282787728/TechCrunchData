With launches already loomingfor both the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift, virtual reality fans have been earnestly awaiting details forthe last major HMDto join the party, the Playstation VR.Yesterday, in an interview with Fox Businesss Maria Bartiromo, Gamestop CEO Paul Raines declared that GameStopwill launch the Sony product this fall, in reference to the upcoming PlayStation VR.Raines also detailed that the company is in discussions to begin carrying both the Oculus and HTC headsets.While the comments certainly suggest PSVR availability by the fall, its unclear whether Rainess comments indicate that the PSVR will be sold at GameStop at its launch or whether the device will be available elsewhere earlier.Known as Project Morpheus in a previous life, PSVR offers a unique approach to VR gamingas it runs on a current generation game console, the PS4. The device, which also makes use of other existing hardware solutions including the Playstation Move controllers, is considered a major threat in the VR space due to the healthyecosystem already surrounding the device.While the folks over at Oculus and HTC are having to convince consumers to invest in the headsets alongside expensive PC builds, there are already 36 million PS4s on the market ready to work with PSVR.Though theres still no word on final pricing for the headset, Bloomberg reported in September that the device will be priced as a new gaming platform, according to an interview with Sony exec Andrew House.If this information is true, Sony willhave ample time to witness the reception of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive which launch in March and (most likely) April respectively. Sony had most previously suggested a release date ofthe first half of 2016 for the headset.
