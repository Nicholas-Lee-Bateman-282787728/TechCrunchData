Less confusing, more personalizedand interactivefood labeling is the worthy mission of a just launched data visualization platform called Sage. The idea spun out of New York-based designer, developer and founder Sam Slovers personal interest in healthier eating  and thesis on food tracking (in which he totted upthe multiple thousands of ingredients he was ingesting fromprocessed foods while still a student, pushing him towardseating more whole foods).Theres a big push for data transparency for a certain type of consumer. This tends to be people who care a lot about nutrition, people who care a lot about the environment, and then millennials  younger people seem to care a lot about this issue, says Slover.The thing that we saw was that theres a certain type of new brand in store  lets say the Wholefoods type  that actually wants to communicate this sort of information to their customers. And they havent ever really had a good tool to do that.The current food label, in pretty much every country, is just a data dump of information. All of the nutrition information is put on the packaging but with no real structure, he adds, explaining why he thinks food labeling is ripe for upgrading.Sage is a web app for now, with native iOS and Android apps in the works. Its basically a database of (currently a couple of thousand)food products  built with the crowdsourced help of a team of nutritionists  that users can search to get clearer information about particular food products and individual food ingredients. Clearer thanks in no small part toSlovers skills as a designer.Hes bootstrapped Sages development thus far with the help of some design competition winnings  but says hell be looking for a more sustainablesource of funding in the future, whether thats public support (given the scope of current political interest in food labeling and consumer health) or by taking the investor route.The Sage platform shows visualizations of food product data, breaking outspecific ingredients  such as additives andGMOs  to provider clearer indications of when individual products mightbe a cause for concern (or vice versa).Serving sizes can also be adjusted to more easily customize nutrition data to each individuals diet. And personal factors such as allergies can be taken into account to allow problem ingredients to be instantly flagged up.The platform can also map outwhere the food and its ingredients have come from geographically  interesting if you want to track food miles to lower your carbon footprint.Sagealso letsusers create visual collections of food products that might beuseful for their specific dietary needs  sort of like Pinterest but with a tighter foodiefocused, given the nutrition data inherent on the platform.Slovernotes that beta users have created collectionssuch asDiabetesSuperfoodsandEating Well While Traveling, for instance.Sage isnot currently offering a way to trackyour cumulative food/nutritionist intake, albeit thats something Slover says is part of the long-term vision.That will eventually involve tracking cumulative food intake too (and pulling out interesting insights). But, to do that, first we need to have lots of products in the system, which is why weve started with the first approach, he says.Building a community of food-conscious individuals is clearly front of mind. As is working with health-conscious food brands. Slover says hesproritizedadding non-processed basic food items, such as fruit and vegetables, to the database of food products powering Sage, followed by productsfrom U.S. food brands Whole Foods and Trader Joes  which he reckons will mesh well with a health food conscious early adopter hes expecting to take toSage.Food searches can be done by keyword or brand name (to foreground multiple products) but Slover saysheseyeing computer vision as a possible route tomaking product food searches snappier on mobile. Its becoming more and more easy for your camera on your phone  you just take a picture, we know what it is, and then we can immediately show you a better label, he adds.While Sage is free to use, the aim is to build a business by monetizing down the line. The food consumptiondata itself is one option. But Slover also sees revenue generation opportunities by working with food retailers to augmentthe consumers shopping experience.Theres an interesting opportunity to innovate the in store shopping experience, he tells TechCrunch. It turns out theres a lot of stores and a lot of brands who are thinking abouthow to give a new type of consumer a better in store shopping experience using new technology. If you think about how you use new technology in a grocery store right now its pretty much non-existent. So there is a lot of big brands and well known stores who are actively seeking for ways to give consumers a more unique and personalized experience when theyre shopping  now that everybody does have a computer in their pocket. So those are a lot of the conversations were having right now.Providing pertinent nutrition notifications to Sage users while they shop via a wearable device like the Apple Watch could be anotherfuture possibility. Sages incoming native mobile apps will display food label information via cards  a la Google Now.As people move more and more to getting bursts of information on things like an Apple Watch cards are the design approach I like for that, adds Slover.
