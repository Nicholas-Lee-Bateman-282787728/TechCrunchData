If you work for a tech company, you are probably poorertoday than you were yesterday.In the midst of a broader selloff, technology as an industry managed a roughly flat performance, as measured by Google Finances tech category. However, among the firms that we discuss and cover the most here at TechCrunch, things were a bit more rough.We recently published a short piece of analysis, digging into the performance of a few dozen public tech firms, stratified by their age, and IPO recency. The numbers were rough.What follows is the per-share performance of those companies today and today only:Recent IPOsPercent change, today:AdolescentsPercent change, today:Where Your Parents WorkedPercent change, today:What It May MeanShares down in a down market? I can hear your shock from here. Of course it isnt surprising that the value of public tech companies eased in the face of rough global conditions, but there is more in that bucket of numbers than just obvious trend-following.Summing quickly, it seems that investor sentiment has lowered further when it comes to younger, public SaaS shops. That likely has the precise forward-IPO impact that you are currently imagining.And finally, look at all that red. That none of our previously selected firms could manage a gain today is telling. Yes, things are weak in the markets, but it seems that for tech, weakness is also an intra-issue.
