The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off in Stockholm is literally right around the corner  in fact its happening tomorrow on June 7. Im currently sitting at the airport in Paris, waiting for my flight. I woke up way too early  and yet, I couldnt be more excited about going to Stockholm. If you like the fantastic world of startups and youre available tomorrow, its time to buy your ticket.As the name suggests, the TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off is a double feature. Were all getting together to have a drink, meet interesting people, talk about the startup ecosystem and the meaning of life. And were coming to Stockholm for the first time ever.Weve already selected 10 beautiful startups for out pitch-off competition. They will have exactly two minutes to pitch their product to a panel of VC judges and TechCrunch editors. At the end of the night, well crown the winner of the Stockholm Pitch-Off.The best part is that the winner will get a booth in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt in London. Second and third places will respectively get two tickets and one ticket for the big show.Whether youre excited by the pitch-off or simply want to hang out with us, you should come! Dont buy your ticket later, buy it now as this is basically your last chance. Its going to be a warm and sunny evening, and did I mention were taking care of the drinks?Date: June 7
