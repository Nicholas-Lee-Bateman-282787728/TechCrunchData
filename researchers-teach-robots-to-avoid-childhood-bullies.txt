Kids are mean. Just ask any robot.Robotics engineers have discovered a tendency for little kids  kindergarteners and grade schoolers  to be abusive towards robots when theyre not near their parents. To prove this, the researchers sent a wheeled robot out into a mall and watched it perambulate around foot traffic. When a little kid approached with his or her parent, the kid tended to tease the robot for a moment  stand in its way, for example  and then move on. But if you got three or four little tykes together you would see them abuse therobot by pushing it, hitting it, and even making a ring around it so it couldnt escape.In an initial paper researchers discovered that even if the robot werelife-like and friendly, children would abuse it, a trait that has been exhibited in childhood animal abuse. In fact, humans only gain empathy for robots later in life.The solution? Researchers programmed the robot to assess a situation and, in short, go tell an adult. By assessing the current situation, the robots are able to tell if, say, a child is alone or with a parent. When the potential for abuse gets too high  when multiple children gather around it, for example  the robot can change course and head toward the nearest tall person. The kids are less likely to abuse it there, and then the robot can wait until its safe.Writes Dr. Kate Darling, robot ethicist:Sadly the kids are still calling the robots bad names, including idiot. That is sad and very unfair but fear not  a few zaps from a shoulder-mounted protective cattle prod should shut the little shavers up in the future.
