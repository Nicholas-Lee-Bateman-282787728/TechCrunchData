Apple has partnered with on-demand delivery startup Postmates to offer same-day delivery of certain items in the Apple Store.Weve been able to order items from the nearest Apple Store on the Postmates app for a while. However, this is a pilot partnership between the Apple Store app and the on-demand delivery startup.Apple fans can get items delivered to them via Postmates such as a new lightening cable, Apple TVor other select items within a four-hour window on the Apple Store app in certain areas where Postmates operates.Postmates currently delivers in several U.S. cities, including San Francisco. However, same-day delivery is only available for residents in the Bay Area from San Mateo to Santa Clara at the moment so residents in San Francisco proper will have to wait to see if the option becomes available to them.Postmates and Apple could not confirm this partnership, but several sources close to the matter tell us Postmates is handling the delivery operations for the Apple Store app where Postmates delivers.Update: Apple has confirmed the partnership with Postmates to deliver items in certain areas.
