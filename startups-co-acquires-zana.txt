Startups.co has been busy buying services like like Zirtual and Clarity.fmto build a network of connected products for entrepreneurs. Next up: Zana, a sitethat says its democratizing entrepreneurship.The acquisition was reported last week by Columbus Business First. Startups.co CEO Wil Schroter told metoday that the deal was a mix of cash and stock, with a price in the single digit millions.Zana was founded by Shea Tate-DiDonna, who previously created the True University program at True Ventures. It covers topics like fundraising and product development, with video lessons from speakers like Steve Blank and Matt Mullenweg.While Tate-DiDonna moves on to start something new, Schroter said he plans to fold Zanas content into the main Startups.co site, which will become the content hub across the companys various services (also incorporating stories from Startups.cos Killerstartups). With 1 million startups and a total of 20 million registered usersacross the platform, Schroter said Startups.co can already bring this content to a broad audience.Our startups are dying for education, he said.This marks Schroters fifth acquisition of a venture-backed startup in the past 18 months. (He said the last two deals valued Startups.co at more than $100 million.) He saidhes been seeing more startups trying to find a home at an M&A and partnership level.One of the downsides of everybody funding the unicorns at crazy valuations is that the just okay companies, companies doing a few million dollars in revenue, arent getting a lot of love right now, Schrotersaid. There are good, interesting companies that are all getting basically ignored.
