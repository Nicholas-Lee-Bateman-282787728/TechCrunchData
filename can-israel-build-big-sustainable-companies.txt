Zach Abramowitz is the co-founder and CEO of ReplyAll.The Israeli start-up ecosystem is a well-oiled investment machine that has been turning out companies for the better part of two decades.The countryhas its own homegrown angels like Gigi Levy-Weiss and Eilon Tirosh, venture capital firms like Carmel, JVP, Pitango and Canaan, equity crowdfunding firms like OurCrowd and iAngels, and Silicon Valley firms with offices on the ground likeBattery Ventures andSequoia(thatsnot to mention the new wave of Asian investorsbetting on Israeli start-ups).But, for all the Start-up Nation fanfare, Googles acquisition of Waze  Israels highest profile start-up exit to date  was valued at just $1.1B. And, whileIsrael officially has twoUnicorn companieson the CrunchBase list (more if you count companies like Taboola and WeWork),only a handful of Israeli companies have actually exited in the billion dollar range. This is, at least in part, by design.Yossi Vardi, one of Israels most successful angel investors, has advised Israeli entrepreneurs tobuild great productsthat can,like his portfolio company ICQ (which sold to AOL),be acquired by bigger companies in Silicon Valley.Eden Shochat certainly knows something about early exits. Facial recognition company Face.com, which he co-founded, sold to Facebook for a reported $60M after raising just $5 million in investment. But now, as a founding partner atAleph, a $150 million early stage VC in Tel Aviv, his goal is to fund Israeli entrepreneurs who want to build global businesses. Some of his portfolio companies include Meerkat, FreightOS and Lemonade.Recently, I sat down with Eden at WeWork (one of his portfolio companies) in Tel Aviv where he shared with me his vision for what he and others refer to as the Scale-up Nation, an Israeli ecosystem made of companies that are built to last, rather than Vardis vision of products that are built to exit. After our meeting, we exchanged notes about the feasibility of building Google sized companies out of Israel, the impact of regional violence and how, if at all, Aleph really differs from the older guard of Israeli investors.
