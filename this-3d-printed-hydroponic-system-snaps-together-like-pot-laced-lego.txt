As we move towards a 420 future, hydroponic systems for a bit of homegrown foliage will be in great demand. The folks at 3Dponics are ready. Theyve announced a sort of modular hydroponic garden that snaps together like stoner LEGO and feature little pots, shields, and filters for your wee buds.The 3Dponics folks are planning to release more information later this week but presumably anyone with a 3D printer can manufacture a fairly large hydroponic system with a little effort.Obviously youre going to need some lights, some solution, and a few friends who will come over and bum weed all the time, but thats par for the course.via 3Ders
