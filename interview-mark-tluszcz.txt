During our call I asked what it will take for Europe to produce another world-beating consumer technology company on the same level as the internet calling giant, why Tluszcz thinks fintech is thus-far overhyped, and the proliferation of fake unicorns (startups that will find it hard to live up to their billion dollar or more valuations).Finally, I had Tluszcz explain his claimed interest in investing in weird ideas  the weirder the better, he says  and to give examples of where Mangrove has done just that.A lightly edited recording of the interview follows below.
