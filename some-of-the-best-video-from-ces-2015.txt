CES is a huge show. While we focused on Hardware Battlefield, in truth we covered miles of convention center and shot hours of film. And we want you to watch some of the best of it.While you can enjoy all of our video over here, Ive picked out a few of our favorite clips to show the madness, the dronelove, and the magic of CES. Its a massive event and its loads of fun and were glad you chose to spend it with us. See you next year!
