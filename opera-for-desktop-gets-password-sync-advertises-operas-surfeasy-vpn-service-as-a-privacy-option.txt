Earlier this year, Opera Software bought SurfEasy, avirtual private networking (VPN) service that helps usersmaintain their privacy and surf safely. With the release of Opera 32 for desktop today, the company is now starting to integrate SurfEasy into its flagship browser for Windows, Mac and Linux.For now, this integration is pretty light, though. When you open a private tab in Opera 32, the browser will pop up a link to download SurfEasy. Thats it for the time being, butchances are the company is working on a tighter integration between its toolsand SurfEasy. Besides itsbrowsers,Opera Max, its compression-centric proxy service for Android,seems like a natural fit for a SurfEasy integrationSurfEasy offers both a mobile and desktop service, but its free tier only allows for 500mb of transfer volume. To get unlimited data, you need to pay at least $3.99 per month for the desktop version or $2.49 for the mobile app.Also new in this version are improved syncing options. Most importantly, this means you can now also sync your password in addition to your bookmarks, tabs and other browser data.Other new features includethe option to see your bookmarks in a tree view to make it easier forusers with lots of bookmarks to organize them.In case you feel a static background image isntpersonal enough for your taste, Opera now also allows you to choose an animated background themefor your Speed Dial (Operas version of the new tab page in other browsers). The company uses the Google-backed WebM and WebP file formats for this, which should keep the files pretty small.
