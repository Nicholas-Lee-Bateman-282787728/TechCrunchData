Over the past few years, Haxlr8r has helped a number of hardware startups go from the idea or prototype stage to actual production. But what happens when their products are finished? Those companies still need to find a way to get into stores and find distribution for their products.To help them with that, Haxlr8r  now known as Hax  is launching a new program for hardware companies that actually have product, but now need to navigate the pesky waters of marketing and distribution. The new Hax Boost accelerator, which begins this September, aims to help hardware startups understand how to find the right distribution channels and retail partners for their products.Hax Boost is a six-week program through which hardware startups will learn how to develop a channel strategy, optimize supply chain and logistics, learn how to build a hardware sales organization, and connect with potential retail partners and distributors. Like most accelerators, there will also be office hours and meetings with mentors who have been through the process and can give advice about how to improve distribution strategies.Since its a shorter program than most accelerators, and since most companies will be further along than the typical startup joining an accelerator, Hax Boost takes just 2 percent of equity for companies that complete it. The program is taking applications now through July 11.While its adding the new program in San Francisco, Hax will continue to run its classic hardware accelerator, now called Hax Accelerator. In fact, its still taking applications now through May 23, for a program that begins in July.In addition to announcing the new accelerator program, Hax will also begin offering matching funds of up to $200,000 for startups that have been through the program when they reach a point where theyre ready to take institutional funding. That part of its offer will begin with the next accelerator class.The news announcements come just ahead of the firms demo day today, where participating companies will show off the products theyve been working on for the last few months. Well have more on that later
