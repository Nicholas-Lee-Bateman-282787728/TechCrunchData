The Apple Watch Herms has been a rare, expensive fashion accessory. Apple announced the limited edition and partnership at its conference in September and released the watch in October 2015. The only issue is that only a handful of stores in major cities are selling this watch. According to Fashionista, the watch will be available on Apple.com and Hermss website on Friday.As a reminder, the Apple Watch Herms comes with a stainless steel Apple Watch, an iconic leather strap and an exclusive watch face. Herms has been using brown leather with a white seam in for its mechanical watches. The company is reusing the same design paired with an Apple Watch. Herms is making the straps in its French tannery. As for the watch face, it uses Hermss typeface and features the companys logo.There are three different strap models and four different colors  brown, blue, black and red. The iconic double tour and handcuff straps are a stark departure from Apples sober design elements.Depending on the model and the strap, an Apple Watch Herms costs betweeen $1,100 and $1,500. Quite expensive, but its sill a lot cheaper than the gold Apple Watch Edition. It will be interesting to see whether Apple is going to partner with other fashion companies in the future for limited editions. But we might have to wait for the Watch 2.
