The league of taxi apps rivaling Uber is alive and well after GrabTaxi, the SoftBank-backed company that rivals the U.S. firm in Southeast Asia, became the latestUber competitor to introduce a carpooling service for commuters.GrabTaxi, which currently offers rides with registered taxis, private chauffeurs and  in some countries  motorbike taxis, is stepping into the peer-to-peer space for the first time with Hitch. Like its namesake service in the U.S. from Lyft, Didi Kuaidis Hitch in China and Ola Share in India, the service is a carpooling option that costs less than a taxi. The idea is that you can take a cheaper ride than usual with a car owner who is headedin the same direction, e.g. commuting into work or a weekend trip, and drivers offset the cost of running a car.GrabHitch, as the service is called, will be another option available inside the GrabTaxi app, and it isinitially being piloted in Singapore. GrabTaxi said it expects to fully launch GrabHitch in Singapore before the end of the year, after which it will be expanded to other markets in Southeast Asia during 2016.The move is an interesting one since GrabTaxi has made its mark, and rivaled Uber in Southeast Asia, by predominantly focusing on licensed taxi rides. Stepping into peer-to-peer with GrabHitch, does it risk upsetting the taxi drivers who rely on, and have been loyal, to its service by letting anyone with a car become a taxi driver?GrabTaxi co-founderTan Hooi Ling positioned the service as filling a voidin the market  and increasingly vehicle supply  rather than cutting into traditional cabbies.Theres a large gap between taxis and public transport services, she told TechCrunch in an interview. Public transportation [like buses] typically costs SG$1-3 in Singapore, for example, while taxis are something like SG$15. Thats where we think we think theres a great opportunity for something like Hitch to come into play.GrabHitch drivers, she added, are those who own a car and are looking for ways to offset costs  such as petrol, insurance and maintenance  by offering rides to those who are going in the same direction or to the same end destination.As for any concerns that existing professional drivers may have, Ling said that  like other services offered by GrabTaxi  GrabHitch isan additional input funnel to the demand side of our platform. In other words, one day I take a GrabHitch ride, but another I might book a regular GrabTaxi or decide on a private chauffeur from the GrabCar service.Singapore looks like an obvious first market to start the initiative for a few reasons. Not only is GrabTaxi, which was founded in Malaysia initially, headquartered there, butcar ownership is expensive there, taxis are pricey, while the city-statesride-sharing regulations are, Ling said, very favorable to this new service.In line with those rules, drivers can only take two GrabHitch rides per day, and the fare should cover consumption costs only  for example petrol.Uber rivals GrabTaxi in Singapore, where it offers Uber Black and Uber X, among other services. The latter is an obvious rival to GrabHitch since it offers a more affordable ride than a taxi. With Uber X Singapore costing a base fare of$3.50 and additional fees of $0.25 per minute or $0.50 per kilometer, itll be interesting to see how GrabHitch competes on price.When asked whether GrabHitch was developed in partnership with Didi Kuaidi, which recently invested in GrabTaxi and has put money into Lyft and Ola in India, Lingdeclined to be overly specific.In every idea we pursue, we look for data points and market points from multiple different sources. We have discussions around mutual best practices, she said, declining to say whether GrabTaxi has plans for other peer-to-peer services further down the line. (Didi Kuaidi has launched a designated driver service, community buses, test drives and more.)Ok then. She also refused to confirm whether GrabTaxi is actively seeking to fill its CTO position, which has been vacant since August when former Facebook engineerWei Zhu left the post after just one year in the role. Zhu was, among other things, heading up the companys $100 million R&D center in Singapore. Ling did saythat, for now, GrabTaxi VP of Engineering  former Amazon and Microsoft execArul Kumaravel  is handling manyof the CTO responsibilities.
