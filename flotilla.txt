The U.K.-made low-costRaspberry Pi microcomputer  which was itself conceived with the idea ofencouraging kids to learn coding (yetended up inspiring makers of all ages)  has beena fertileseeding ground for other computing and electronics education projects.Such as the kids focused DIY computer kit, Kano, which shipped its first batch of kits last fall, after raising some $1.5M in crowdfunding in 2013.ThePi-powered momentum is evidently not letting up, either. EnterFlotilla:another electronics education project aimingto build on thePis foundation, and make hardware tinkering more accessible to non-engineers.Flotillas U.K. makers  a startupcalled Pimoroni which haspreviously made a kit for turning the Pi into an arcade machine, called Picade, and a colorful Pi case called the Pibow, among other products  isnowraising crowdfunds on Kickstarter to get Flotilla to market byMay. Development costs thus far have been funded by Pimoronis existing business.Flotilla consists of a series of plug and play hardware modulesthat arecontrolledby a Pi but can be programmed via different softwareinterfaces, depending on the users skill level.The price-point aimsto be child-friendly too, with a starter kit (whichincludes two modules) costing 24/$36 to Kickstarter backers.Hardware modules offered in thekits include components such as lights, motion sensors, color sensors, motors and so on. These are connected to a Pi (not itself included in the kits), via the Flotilla dock board, and are then programmed via web app interfaces.The modules themselves are not wireless, so whatever you build with Flotilla is going to involve cables, but that does avoid the need for each module to packits own battery.At itsmost basic, the Flotilla kit willoffer a seriesof electronics project recipe cards setting out step-by-step instructions to build guided projects such ascreatinga virtual pet, or makinga line-following robot. The user then connects up the relevant hardware modules and follows some simple instructions via FlotillasCookbook web app to createthe project.At this point the aim is to get kids and people with no experience interested and engaged withelectronics  so there are alsocolorful cards that accompanythe recipes toaugment hardware projectswith a littlechild-friendly paper-craft.One step up from here,Flotilla offers a web app interface calledRockpool where users can play around a bit more by creating rules that link their various hardware modules together. Again no programming knowledge is required but the user is encouraged to engage with underlying logic concepts.To enable progression beyond this, the team says it is also working on adding support for the Scratch graphical programming language. And has added Python support, building its own libraries and documentation to ensure a streamlined experience.Flotilla can be a great prototyping or training tool, saving you tons of time. It hasplug and playsimplicity, code libraries, example projects, and full documentation, it notes on its Kickstarter page.The initial plan is to launch Flotilla with 12 modules, although more are planned and the team hasalready passed itsoriginal funding target, with just under 44,000 ($66,700) pledgedat the time of writing and another 27 days left of their campaign to run. So theyre well on their way to getting this concept to market.Flotilla was something we started talking about early last year and we spent a lot of time trying out ideas and getting feedback  the original inspiration was to make something that people of any ability level can immediately work with  progressing their skills at their own pace. To us thats absolutely crucial, Pimoroni co-founder Jon Williamson tells TechCrunch.Big vision wise we have around 30 other modules were considering along with more Cookbook recipes and projects  the key point for us it keeping the pricing at the pocket-money level.Flotilla is by no meansthe only electronics made easier outfitin town. There are increasing numbers of learner kits available, whether itsLittleBitsor Adafruits energetic efforts, or the forthcomingSAM wireless connected object maker moduleswhichpulled inaround 125,000 on Kickstarter last year. But Pimoroni still reckons theres room for anotherthoughtful take, which aims to widen electronics appealand build in stepped progression to aid learning.In the U.K. there has been fresh impetusfor startups to attack this space with the launch last year of an overhauled computing curriculum in England whichrequires schools to teach kids coding  thereby pushing up demand for productswhichbreak down electronics and programming into bite-sized chunks.Williamson says Pimoroni is hoping Flotilla willattract interest fromschools and teachers down the line  by providing teachers with a reliable, simple framework to build lesson plans on, as he puts it  although the initial targetis evidently home hobbyists, parents wanting to inspire their kids, and makers wanting a quicker way to build projects.Wed like to approach the education market with it properly including producing full classroom materials  thats not part of our core skill-set but were looking to find people that can help! he adds.
