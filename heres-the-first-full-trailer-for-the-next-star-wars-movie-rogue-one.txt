Hey. You. On the computer. You heard about this Star Wars thing? Im told its pretty popular with the kids these days. Its a movie series, you see, about JUST KIDDING, HOLY CRAP EVERYONE, NEW STAR WARS.It might seem like the hype train for the last Star Wars movie is just starting to slow (the home release of Force Awakens was two days ago, after all), but the next Star Wars movie is right around the corner. Its coming out December 16th, 2016.Next in order of release, at least  but not in terms of the storys timeline. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will actually take place immediately before A New Hope just dont expect them to put the word prequel anywhere near this one, lest they accidentally drudge up memories of Jar Jar Binks punching you repeatedly in the heart.Rogue One will be the first Star Wars Anthology film, meant to be a stand-alone story that ties back to the main series but not directly a part of it. In this case, theyre explaining how the rebels got their hands on the plans for the Death Star.Hours after releasing ONE FRIGGIN SECOND of the movie as a sort of trailer-for-the-trailer, the first full trailer for Rogue One is here. And its amazing.
