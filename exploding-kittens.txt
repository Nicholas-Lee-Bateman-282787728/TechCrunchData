Crowdfunding has been a massive boon to old school gaming.Who needs fancy 3D renders and immersive face computers when you haveboard games and shuffled slices of pulped tree, eh? Good times.Even better times are on the cards (obviously) as wondrousInternet comics institutionThe Oatmealis in the midst of harnessing the power of its sprawling online fan-base to crowdfund its very own card game, called Exploding Kittens.Behold themajesty!At the time of writing the Exploding Kittens Kickstarter campaignhas grabbed $1.6 million+ in pledges, from around 41,500 backers, nukingits modest $10,000 initial funding target. And theres still 29 days of funding to go.So hopefully itwillout-dothat stupid beer cooler.The game is described as ahighly strategic kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Which is probably all the explanation you need to shell out $20.One deck is goodfor two to four players.Two decks will support up to eight. And each round of the gameapparently lasts between 10 and 20 minutes  depending on how quickly players are killed off byfailing to defuse anexploding kitten card.Will Exploding Kittens be the new Cards Against Humanity? Probably it will be more like an expansion pack. Expect to be playing bothgames with your parents next Thanksgiving holiday.(Kittens does also havethe bonus ofkid-friendly credentials (the basic deck is apparently suitable for aged 7+), although theres also a NSFW deck of bonus cards for childless kidults.)The Oatmeals Matthew Inman has illustrated the cards. The game concept was originally cooked up byElan Lee (Xbox, ARGs) and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel), with Inman joining in to help weaponize their pork and take everyones money.The team says its working with its pals at Cards Against Humanity to ensuresmooth delivery of what will be a very sizableheapof dead tree to backers. Its aiming to ship decks starting inJuly.
