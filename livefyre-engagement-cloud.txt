Theres been a big push from startups promising to help marketers and publishers take advantage of all theuser-generated content thats posted to social media, but Livefyre CEO Jordan Kretchmer suggested that one area has been relatively neglected  pushing UGC to a brands own website.Kretchmer is announcing a new product today called the Livefyre Engagement Cloud, which brings together the companys existing products into a single platform while also adding some new capabilities.Everything weve built is within our Engagement Cloud, Kretchmersaid. It feels really good and nice and organized, and we didnt lose any functionality in the transition. We didnt deprecate anything. We use every piece in our platform.Livefyre started out as a commenting platform but has since expanded into other areas like liveblogging and content curation.Kretchmer pitched the Engagement Cloud as a suite of products that brands and online publishers can use to connect with their visitors, whether its through comments, discussion forums, polls or a gallery of images from social media.The centerpiece, he said, is the content management system, where marketers can search for different types of social media content, save the contentfor future use and organize it in different folders. You can even automate the process by setting rules for saving content to Livefyre or publishingdirectly to your site.Kretchmer emphasized the bit about saving UGC, because it allows brands create a library of content that they can use in future marketing efforts, rather than starting from scratch every time they prepare a new campaign.Without content, you have no audience, he said.Livefyre also includes a rights management system, where marketers can obtain a users permission to use their content with just a hashtag  without that permission, anytime a user deletes their post, it gets deleted from Livefyre, too.Aside from collecting and saving content, the Engagement Cloud also includes an App Publisher, which is where marketers can actually publish all this UGC to their websites in the form of customized Mosaics and Carousels and so on. (This is where all those other Livefyre products live now.) Marketers can also use Livefyres APIs to create more custom presentations.So is thisonly usefulfor your website? I mean, if it helps you createthis great content library, wouldnt it be nice if you could push that content back to your Facebook and Twitter and Instagram accounts, too?Livefyre Engagement Cloud from Livefyre on Vimeo.Well, Kretchmer isnt ruling that out in the future, but he said the social publishing side is a messy place, so hes happy to focus on the owned-and-operated worldfor now.Livefyre will gradually roll out the Engagement Cloud to all of its customers, hesaid.
