Microsoft today reported earnings for its second financial quarter of 2016 (I know, thats weird, but Microsofts financial year ends in June). The company reported non-GAAP revenue of $25.7 billion for the last quarter and $0.78 of adjusted per-share profit.Wall Street expected Microsoft to deliver an EPS of $0.71 on revenue of $25.26 billion.In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $26.5 billion and earnings of $0.71.Microsofts stock shot up over 7 percent right after the earnings were announced.Businesses everywhere are using the Microsoft Cloud as their digital platform to drive their ambitious transformation agendas, said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer at Microsoft. Businesses are also piloting Windows 10, which will drive deployments beyond 200 million active devices.Last quarter, Microsoft broke out results for its different business units for the first time and thankfully, the company didnt make any changes to this process this time around. Here is whatits results look like when we break them down by business unit.Last quarter, Microsoft also announced that its commercial cloud business was on an $8.2 billion annual run rate. This quarter, the company updated this number to $9.4 billion. Microsoft previously said that it expects this number to hit $20 billion in 2018.As Microsofts director of investor relations Zack Moxcey told me right after the numbers were announced, he still feels good about this projection.The company today stressed that its performance in the cloud strengthened its results. Revenue from server products grew 10 percent, for example, and Azure revenue grew 140 percent.Microsoft also made some headway in monetizing its search ads. Revenue there was up 29 percent, the company today announced. Moxceylargely attributed this to the integration of search into Windows 10.
