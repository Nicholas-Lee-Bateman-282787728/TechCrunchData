Amazons Echo speaker, and its descendents, Dot and Tap, are growing in popularity as consumers preferred smart speakers and the voice computing platform for the home. But theyre also encouraging a wave of developer interest, in the form of add-ons dubbed skills which allow you to teach Amazons personal assistant Alexa new tricks, like calling you an Uberor ordering you a pizza. Today, Amazon announced that its Alexa app store, so to speak  the skills section  has grown to over 1,000 skills. Thats a notable milestone, given that ordering theEcho was only available by invite up until last June.The company has also brought Alexas power to other connected devices, including Fire TV and even those made by third-party hardware makers, thanks to its open platform.To give you an idea of how quickly this third-party app ecosystem has grown, in January of this year, Alexas skills section had reached over 130 apps.In an announcement, the company highlighted several of the more notable additions to Alexas selection of skills, including those from Capital One, Dominos, Fitbit, KAYAK, SmartThings, Uber, and others.Rob Pulciani, Director, Amazon Alexa, also gave an idea of the third-party developer communitys size  which is now in the tens of thousands. That implies significant interest in at least toying around with Alexa, even if not all developers are actually launching apps.Developers who want to build for the platform use the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) to allow their voice-powered apps to work with Alexa, who hears and understands the customers request, resolves it, and maps it the developers endpoint, explains Amazon.Alexas capabilities have also steadily improved over time.For example, in March, Amazon improved Alexa Voice Services, which lets developers add Alexas voice control to their own devices. And just this week, Amazon announced four new Alexa Skills Kit built-in intents that help users of third-party apps more easily navigate the skills, including being able to navigate to the next item in a list, pause an action in-progress, go back to a previous item, or resume an action.But while its great that Alexa has gotten more powerful thanks to these skills, the problem Amazon faces now is one of discovery.The Alexas app store  the skills section in the Alexa app that works with the connected speaker or other Alexa-powered devices  is really bare bones. Search does not work that well, and there are no categories or top charts, as on other app stores. With over 1,000 apps and growing, Amazon will need to do more to bring the best apps to the front-and-center somehow, so potential users can actually find them.
