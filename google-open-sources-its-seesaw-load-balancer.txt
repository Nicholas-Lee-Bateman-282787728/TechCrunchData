Google announcedtoday that it is open-sourcing Seesaw  a Linux-based load balancing system. The code for the project, which is written in Googles Go language, is now available on GitHubunder the Apache license.As Google Site Reliability Engineer Joel Sing, who works on the companys corporate infrastructure, writes in todays announcement, Google used to use two different load balancing systems back in 2012.Both, however, presented different sets of management and stability challenges. So to fix this, he and his team set out to find a new solution and becausethe ones available at the time didnt meet Googles needs, they started writing their own.Because one of the platforms already usedthe Linux Virtual Server (LVS) for network-level load balancing, the team stuck with this. On top of that, though, Google thenimplemented a modular multi-process architecture and some failover and recovery services.After a period of concentrated development effort, we completed and successfully deployed Seesaw v2 as a replacement for both existing platforms, writes Sing. Overall it allowed us to increase service availability and reduce management overhead.Its worth noting that whilethis project comes out of Google, the open-source version is not an official Google product. So dont expect the company to provide any official support.
