Vice and Apple Music are teaming up to release a new docu-series that takes a hard look at some of the most interesting local music scenes in the world.The presser doesnt give a whole lot of detail, but did include descriptions of a techno scene in South Africa and hip hop coming straight out of Minnesotas Native American nations.The series will be called The Score and will include six episodes.Whats cooler, perhaps, is that each episode will be accompanied by a specially made playlist on Apple Music that gives viewers a deeper dive into the actual musical vibe of each local scene.Episode One follows the music found on the Red Lake Reservation in Minnesota, called Reservation Rap, inspired by the culture and the history of the Ojibwa people. Other episodes will show the Vice crew traveling to places like Brazil, Iceland and Vietnam, among others.The first episode is available to stream now.You can check out the trailer here.
