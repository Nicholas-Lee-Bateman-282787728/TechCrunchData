Music discovery platformShazam is today rolling out a new feature inpartnership with over two dozen artists that will allow Shazam users to see whichsongs their favorite musicians are listening to on theservice.The news comes justahead of Apple Musics worldwide debuttomorrow, which will introduce streaming music, radio and other features, including a social network called Connect a sort of Facebook for musiciansthatletsthem share music, videos and notes with fans.According to Shazam, the company has signed up over 30 top artists to participate in itsnew song-sharing feature, including well-known names likePitbull, Calvin Harris, Maroon 5, Meghan Trainor, Coldplay, Usher, One Direction, Alicia Keys, Shakira, Mariah Carey, Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park, and many others.Combined, these artists have a total of 600 million-plus Shazam followers, the company notes. Soon after launch, Shazam says it will expand this functionality beyond theinitial 30 artists to include hundreds of others from around the world.The companywill also now reveal Shazam Counts  the number of times a song has been Shazamed  for the first time ever.The social networking feature will be made available in the updated versions of the iOS and Android mobile applications, out now. To get started, users will have to follow their favorite artists on the appin order to seeing what theyre shazaming. This action will also allowusers to benotified of other information, including new singles, new albums and new videos, the company says.The features launch appearsto be in reaction to Apple Musics upcomingsocial features,which introducesa way to follow favorite artists  something thats availableon Shazam as well. Artists on Shazam will now have a new page on the service that shows their Shazam discoveries, their top tracks, videosand their follower count. Again, this mirrors what Apple is launching with Connect, where fans will follow artists and then be alerted to new releases, or engage withcontent like audio, videos,photos, or even text posts.Of course, Apple MusicsConnect could still be a hit or a miss. This is not the first time Apple has tried to implement a social layer around music, after all  it tried and failed before with its earlier social network called Ping which shut down a few years ago. Apple is hopingthat, with Connect, it will be able to own the relationship between a musician and their fans.But for now its unclear if artists will actually take the time to create exclusive content for Connect, or if it will largely includethe same sort of poststhe artist is already sharing on other social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, for example.In the meantime, despite Apple Musics potential reach, Shazam has a slightly differentiated offering by allowing artists its working with to share what theyre actuallylistening to these days. Thats something many artists already like to do  being known astaste makers  andhelping unearth new musicians andbands before anyone else.This new featurealso squarely ties into Shazams larger goal of being a place to discover new music.The company already offers a number of ways to find new songs youd like, including music charts, a news feed of sorts, Facebook integration (to see what friends are shazaming), a worldwide map of users Shazams, a trending section to see the top tracks or the top tracks by specific regions, and more. With the ability to find and follow artists, get information about their music and the music they like, Shazam is clearly hoping to position itself as a competitor to Apple Music Connect when it comes to music discovery.That being said, Shazam is also working with Apple Music, as it does with other streaming services like Spotify or Rdio.Fans will be able tolisten to the songs artists Shazam by tapping on anew Listen on Apple Music button included in the app, the company says.
