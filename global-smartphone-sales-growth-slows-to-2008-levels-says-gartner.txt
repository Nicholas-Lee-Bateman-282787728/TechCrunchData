Global smartphone sales in Q4 2015 experiencedtheir slowest growth rate since 2008, according to Gartners latest market report. The quarter saw sales of Apples iPhonedecline for the first time, with theanalystcharting a 4.4 per cent decline on the year before quarter for Cupertino.Samsung and Huawei were the only top five smartphone vendors to boost their share, although the South Korean mobile maker only saw a small uplift, growingfrom a 19.9 per cent share in Q4 2014 to 20.7 per cent in Q5 2015.Huaweiachieved the best performance year over year growing 53 per cent, and rising from a 5.7 per cent marketshare in Q4 2015 to 8.0 per cent in Q4 2015. Gartner chalks this up toincreased brand visibility overseas for the Chinese mobile maker.The analyst pegs Androids marketshare at 80.7 per cent for the quarter, up from 76 per cent in the year ago quarter with Googles mobile OS benefitting for increasing demand for affordable smartphones.By contrast, Apples iOS shrank its share from 20.4 per cent in Q4 2014 to 17.7 per cent in Q4 2015. Although Cupertino still managed to narrow the market share gap between it and premium smartphone maker rival Samsung over full year 2015.Meanwhile Windows, mobilesex-platform, dwindled to just a 1.1 per cent global share inthe holiday 2015 quarter.The top five smartphone brands for marketshare are Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi. Collectively the three top Chinese mobile makers took a 17 per cent share of the market in Q4 last year, up from 16.5 per cent in the year ago quarter (although almost allof the growth came from Huawei).What growth there is left in the smartphone market is mainly coming from emerging markets. And Gartner is expecting this trend to become more marked in the coming years.It alsoexpectsChinese OEMs to continue to gain share this year, noting they are well positioned to serve emerging marketdemand for mid-range and low-end smartphones thanks to manufacturing cost advantages.During the next five years we expect growth in the smartphone market to come mostly from emerging markets. Basic and lower-end smartphones will account for two-thirds of smartphone sales by 2019; in the same year, only 20 per cent of smartphone sales will come from mature markets, notes analyst Roberta Cozza in a statement.How Apple responds to thisongoing shift to the lower end is going to be interesting, given that its started seeing iPhone salesgrowth hit a wall. Either it finally makes a truly low cost iPhone, or else itfigures out how to convincemore of Samsungs premium buyers to switch from Android to iOS.Gartners view is that going forward mobile makers have opportunities to penetrate lower tier segments inregions such asemerging Asia/Pacific and EMEA, capitalizing on the remaining shift from feature phones to smartphones.We have witnessed Indian and Chinese players within these regions  such as, Micromax, Xiaomi, Huawei, Intex, Oppo and BBK Electronics  benefit from increased demand for affordable smartphones, notesCozza.The worlds biggest mobile-focused tradeshow kicks off next week in Barcelona. New flagship smartphones are expected to be unboxed at Mobile World Congress, including from Samsung, LG, Huawei and Xiaomi,albeit it looks like its the less flashydevice launches that will actually be fueling smartphonemarket growth in 2016.While affordability is a key engine of the remaining smartphone market growth, Gartner also viewschannel strategy and knowledge of local consumer market dynamics becoming increasingly important  as a consequence of what the analystdubs the highlycommoditized Android market.In other words, Android OEMs will need to work very hard to differentiate their hardware from each other,and partnering with local brands/companies isone strategyto stand out, as Cozza notes:Partnerships with local developers and content providers will also be increasingly important in differentiating offerings.Interestingly itis also the strategy being adopted by Android alternative mobile startup Jolla, which makes the Sailfish OS, and which has been seeking to spread the reach of itsopen mobile platform by forging links with localbrandsin emerging markets. However, pushing any alternative to such a dominant platform as Android remains aSisyphean challenge.
