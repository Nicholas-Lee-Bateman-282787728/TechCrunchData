TCBTC, TechCrunchs bitcoin podcast is back this week, on video, with a special guest, and no John Biggs. All that is fun, aside from the lack of Biggs.Jason Rowley, the person who actually got me into bitcoin originally was on hand, taking us through a meeting that he and Ihad with a member of the Chinese mining community about the future of bitcoin. All told, we had a fun time. If you dont want to talk about block size, this week is not for you, I apologize in advance.Sit back, pour another coffee, and lets talk cryptocurrencies.TCBTC is a mostly-weekly show from TechCrunch, hosted by John Biggs, and Alex Wilhelm. Check back every Thursday for a new whack of bitcoin chatter.
