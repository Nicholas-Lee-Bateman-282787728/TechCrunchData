, an independent podcast focused on venture capital. Following TCs article last Novemberreporting on Arielle Zuckerbergs entrance into the world of venture with Kleiner Perkins, we thought it would be fascinating to check in withherto see how her first 6 months in venture has been.In what turned out to be a refreshingly honest interview we discussed the hardest elements of the transition in venture; what skills Arielle successfully took from her angel investing and product management background to KPCB; how sheevaluates product and her learning process for developing new skills.Our wide-ranging discussion also touched on how ZuckerbergbelievesAI will be embedded into all products; what makes a great founder; and how individuals wishing to enter the venture industry can position themselves well. She even chatted about herinfamous acapella moon walk at KPCBs Monday morning meeting!
