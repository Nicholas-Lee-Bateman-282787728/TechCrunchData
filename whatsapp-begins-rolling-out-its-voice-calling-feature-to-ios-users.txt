Less than a month after WhatsApp introduced free voice calls to users of its Android app, so the Facebook-owned company has begun rolling the feature out to its iOS customers.Like the launch of calling on Android, which was first spotted by eager usersin February, the feature will not be available toall Apple device owners at once. Thecompany said itis rolling out slowly over the next several weeks  thats quicker than the Android deployment, butyoull still need some patience. (Sadly, I dont appear to have the feature just yet, for what its worth.)With 800 million monthly active users on the WhatsApp service, this feature has the potential toupset a lot of carriers worldwide who have already seen their SMS revenues decimated by the rise of messaging apps. WhatsApp itself handlesmore messages fromits users than there are global SMS sent each day. Its worth noting, though, that we dont know how many are on the iOS app.Todays iOS app update also includes a few other nifty features, primarilysupport for theiOS 8 share extension which allows you to send videos, photos and links to WhatsApp chats from other apps. Users can now also take photos quickly inside chats, and theres anoption to send multiple videos at one time  as you can do with photos  each of which can be cropped and rotated before being shared.The launch of calling for iOS is the latest in a steady stream of updates aimed at making WhatsApp more useful than a mere free text message replacement. Another advancement was the launch of a desktop web client in January, thereby enabling users to keep in touch even when their smartphone is stowed away.Yet, WhatsApp doesnt include additional features, such as business-consumer communication, payments or an app platform, all of which are now part of Facebooks Messenger service. That doesnt look like changing for some time, since those differences help Facebooks messaging apps appeal to a spectrumofaudiences  but itdoes make it difficult for WhatsApp to monetize its service in a meaningful way. For now, at least.
