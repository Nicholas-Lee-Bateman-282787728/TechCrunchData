Burrowing owls led to anarchists vomiting on tech shuttles and that now brings us to yet another reality show attempting to capture the current fever pitch in Silicon Valley.Bravos Million Dollar Listing branches over to the Bay Area in tonights premiere episode.Naturally, we sat down with showstar and real estate mogul Andrew Greenwell to find out why he thought shining a light on the high cost of SF housing was such a good idea.Housing is a sore subject for many in SF and this show is sure to bring up some heated emotions. The show is called Million Dollar Listing, but most one bedroom condos in the city go for more than that  and in the space of just a few days. Average salaries dont match up with current real estate values and most people can barely afford rent without some controls in place, due to scarcity in the market. The show will focus on housing at much higher prices than that, and were told most of the drama will center onsellers demands.So sit back and grab some artisanal popcorn with a sprinkling of brewers yeast Bay people and beyond. Million Dollar Listing San Francisco premieres tonight at 10PM EST/PST.
