Video ad startup Virool has raised $12 million in Series A funding.The company works with publishers including Mashable, Adweek and The Onion. It offers what it calls anInline video ad unit, which has already been served across more than 2,000 online properties and which creates new adinventory by launching video ads in the middle of articles and other editorial content.Does that sound kind of annoying? Well, CEO Alex Debelov said its designed to be very non-intrusive  it doesnt playsound unless you hover yourmouse over the ad (or, on mobile, when you actually stop scrolling). Some publishers go further, by only turning the sound on if you actually hit a button.More broadly, Debelov said the companysmission is to make advertising human. He argued that because thesekinds of native units offer opportunities for viewers to engage with and share the ads, they incentivize marketersto create more engaging videos.In addition, Virool has developed technology that it calls eIQ, using webcams to help advertisers understand viewers emotional response to their videos.Virool was incubated at Y Combinator and raised a $6.6 million seed roundin 2013. The Series A comes fromMenlo Ventures, Yahoo Japan, Flint Capital and 500 Startups.Debelov also said theres a difference between struggling ad-tech companies that focused on arbitrage and things that are outdated, versus companies like Virool that are doing something new and growing fast.Next up: More mobile ad units and geographic expansion, including (as the Yahoo Japan investment suggests) efforts in Japan.
