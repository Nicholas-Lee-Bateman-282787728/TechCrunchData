San Francisco-based Mixed Dimensions, which makes software targeting the 3D printing space, has closed a $4 million Series A, with the funding round led by Silicon Valley investors Alsop Louie Partners and Dolby Family Ventures.Existing investors, including itsoriginal investor Silicon Badia, also participated, joined by new investor Draper Athena and others.The new funding will be funneled intotech development of its core product and also for hiring aimed at growing market share.We last covered Mixed Dimensionstwo years ago when its grand planwas tobuild a marketplace for 3D printable objects  to tap into what it assumed would be fast-flowingconsumer demand to print all sorts of objects.In the event its had to have a rethink,given 3D printing has plunged from peak hype, back in 2014, to the relativedoldrums of low uptake and reduced expectation in 2016. Theres certainly no doubt thatmass market commercialization of additive manufacturing has proved more fiddly and time-consuming than some envisaged.Mixed Dimensions has thus retooled itsoriginal concept, and shifted focus from consumer to b2b. Itis now pushingtwo products:MakePrintable, a cloud-based verifying/healing/repairing tool for 3D printing which its largelyangling as ab2b product; and GamePrint, a consumer tool that enables gamers to 3D print a particular gameplay moment.Because nothing says pwned ya! quitelike having a 3D model of the moment you pwned your gaming buddy sittingon your deskfor posterity.The startupwas also previously hoping to have closed a Series A back in summer 2014, but co-founder Mo Taslaq says it has instead been working on its technology, while also, doubtless, adapting to the slower burn reality of 3D printing demand.Itlaunched a beta lastOctober and Taslaq says it now has several thousands of users. Its also beenforginglinks with others in the space, inkingpartnerships with3D printing services, CAD tools and marketplaces  including Thingiverse. So the thinking here looks to beabout 3D printing players bandingtogether to better serve what modest demand there is.3D printing has not exploded into a mainstream tech especially for consumers and there are many reasons for this whether hardware related, software related, or even general awareness/education on how 3D printing is a need to have versus a nice to have, says Taslaq.We decided to re-focus on our core competency which is building innovative technology and decided to tackle head-on one of the bigger issues in 3D printing today: printability.Unlike most [3D model] healingsolutions out there where the healing process is general and basic our tech takes into consideration the targeted print, [whatever]the final size of the print, theprinter or material used, resulting in a fix tailored to the desired final print and our solution also handles some of the most advanced issues in 3D printing such as wall thickness, he adds.MakePrintable is mainly targeting other 3D printing companies  such as marketplaces like Shapeways  rather than being a direct-to-consumer play. While GamePrint is focused on a consumer niche, but one which the startup is betting will be faster on the uptake of nascent 3D printing than the average consumer.We came with the idea of GamePrint a couple of years ago when we realized that everyone wants to print something that is relevant to them and to their personal experiences and nothing can live to the expectations and streamline the process to a single click like capturing of gameplay moments, he says, adding that the team has a gaming background, including previously building middleware tech for gaming engines like Unity.One of our advisors back then was also in the toy industry so when we had an aha moment: gamers are obsessed with their games, characters and gameplay, 3D printing can provide a way to print these games, all we needed to do is to make sure that the game scene is actually printable and voila you have gameprint!Mixed Dimensions is not the only company hoping3D selfies might fire up consumer interest in additive manufacturing. Indeed, German company Doob has opened bricks and mortar stores in several cities around the world where consumers can walk in, get body scanned and pick upa 3D micro-replica of themselves at a later date.But the gaming selfie spin does at least address a more specificdemographic  and get around the uncanny valley problem of trying to sell people a realistic 3D selfie.In terms of main competitors at this point, Taslaq namechecksMaterialise andAutodesk  including the lattersrecent acquisition, Netfabb.
