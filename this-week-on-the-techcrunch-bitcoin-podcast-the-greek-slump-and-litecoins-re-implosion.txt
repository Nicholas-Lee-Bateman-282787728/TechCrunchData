And lo, volatility returned to the crypto-markets.Its been a fun week in the bitcoin markets, having seen the price of the stuff break the emotionally important $300 mark, only to fall back underneath it. The mini rally was perhaps inspired in part by Grecian fever dreams.And then there was Litecoin, which cause a stir by showing something akin to life, before giving up the ghostin a massive slide. Pump and dump? That or improbable spike followed by a nearly record decline.Biggs is off next week, so well be back in a fortnight.
