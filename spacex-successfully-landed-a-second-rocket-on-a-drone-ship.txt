SpaceX successfully launched the Japanese communications satellite, JCSAT-14 on their Falcon 9 rocket at 1:22am EST today from Cape Canaveral, Florida. After the launch, the company soft-landed the first stage of the rocket on their drone ship Of Course I Still Love You  the second time this has ever been done.Landing confirmed. Second stage continuing to carry JCSAT-14 to a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. pic.twitter.com/HfHI5cwoYX SpaceX (@SpaceX) May 6, 2016On April 8th, SpaceX made their first rocket recovery on that same drone ship. Tonights landing, however, was even more impressive. The odds of a successful soft-landing were slim due to the mission requirements for this particular launch.Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 6, 2016JCSAT-14, which is designed to last 15 years, needed to be placed into geosynchronous orbit at an altitude of 22,000 miles. This is much higher than SpaceXs last launch when they successfully recovered their rocket on a drone ship after sending space station supplies to low earth orbit (LEO) at around 250 miles.JCSAT-14 / Image courtesy of Space Systems LoralThe SpaceX co-hosts noted that because todays rocket needed to travel to such a high altitude, the first stage was coming in much hotter, at around 2 km/s, than standard LEO launches where the rocket will returnat about 1 km/s.Successful JCSAT-14 deployment from Falcon 9 / Screenshot from SpaceX live feedJCSAT-14 is a satellite from the SKY Perfect JSAT Group, the largest satellite operator in Asia. Once in orbit, the satellite will be used to provide television and communication services.Illustration of JCSAT-14 / Image courtesy Space Systems LoralTonights launch was the fourth successful flight for SpaceX so far this year. To date, SpaceX has completed two successful rocket recoveries on a drone ship and one rocket recovery on a landing pad on stable ground.The next important step, of course, is reusing a recovered rocket, which Musk has stated they hope to do in the next three or four months.@dannysparker Aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months, pending detailed examination and 10X refiring of a returned booster Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 20, 2016
