Samsung has begun rolling outits answer to Apple Pay in Korea this week.The service is called Samsung Pay andit is powered by LoopPay,the Boston-based company that Samsung snapped up earlier this year. Its due to launch in Korea and the U.S. first before expanding worldwide, but Samsung has nudged it into actionwith a pre-launch pilot program amongGalaxy S6 and S6 Edge ownersin its homecountry.They seemnearly identical,but Samsung Pay has a couple if differencescompared to ApplePay. While both support NFC, Samsungs service goes a step further with support formagnetic secure transmission (MST) technologies in existing point of sale devices. Thats convenient for retailers who dont need to upgrade their terminals to supportit.Like Apple, Samsung customers pay by putting their device near the payment terminal in store and either authenticate payment via their fingerprint or by inputting a code. TheSamsung Pay app lets users stash a range of credit cards for use, but actual data is neitherstored on device nor sent during a transaction. Samsung said it uses a variety of security technologies and a high level encryption system to keep data safe.The Korean firmshuttered its wallet service earlier this year, explaining that the usage rate was not what anyone expected.It then moved on to payments with the deal for LoopPay. Its still early days for Apple Pay, which expanded into the UK this week, and itll be interesting to see what kind of impact Samsungs response has  both in terms of retail and engagement/retention of existing Samsung customers.
