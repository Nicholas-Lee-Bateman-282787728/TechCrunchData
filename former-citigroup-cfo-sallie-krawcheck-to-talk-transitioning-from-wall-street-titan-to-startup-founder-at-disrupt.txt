Sallie Krawcheck isnt your typical startup founder. For one thing, she was the president of Global Wealth and Investment Management at Bank of America.And the CFO of Citigroup.And the CEO of Smith Barney and Sanford Bernstein before that.In fact, Krawcheck, who remains highly regarded on Wall Street, could have remainedpart of the banking establishment. Instead, after being let go from Bank of America after current CEO Brian Moynihan took the top job, Krawcheck decided instead to switch gears and work for herself.She first bought Ellevate, aglobal network with tens of thousands ofmembers that promotes women as business leaders.It wasnt as easy a transition as she might have imagined. In fact,last year, she called herhigh-powered banking positions a breeze compared with running acompany.Never one to shy from a challenge, however, Krawcheck has gone a step further, founding her own startup for the first time:Ellevest.The still-in-beta investment platform for women raised $10 million in Series A funding last fall, including from the investment research firm Morningstar; Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz; and Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, among others.Krawcheck hasnt shared many more details.
