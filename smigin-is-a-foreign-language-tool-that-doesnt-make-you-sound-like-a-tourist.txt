If youve ever tried to learn a foreign language, you probably knowthat most existing methods focus on aspects of the language that arent very helpful in everyday life. For example, newcomers to a language are often first taught thenames ofanimals or colors, words that arent normally applicable to the common traveler.Smigin aims to fix this problem with itsapp that allows travelers to build and hearcommon phrases spoken by a native speaker.The apps Phrasebuilder consists of a three-column interface whereusers can combine actions and nouns,letting them create tens of thousands of different sentenceson the fly.Smigin today released a total overhaul which for the first time introduces a monetization strategy for the year-old company. The app now categorizes phrasebooks within each language by popular sections like cafes, bars, and shopping.The cafe section will be free in all languages, and users can pay $4.99 to unlock all additional categories for a specific language. Susan OBrien, Smigins CEO told me that the company choseto leave the cafe section free because its by far the most used category, and is broad enough that it can still sometimes apply to other situations.One thing unique about Smiginis that userscan only create phrases incorporating theinfinitive form of verbs. This restrictionallows the app to produce translations that always sound like something out of native speakers mouth.For example, you canuse the app to say I have to eat or I need to eat, but not phrases like sheis eating right now. As seen in the photo below (with the example to eat),most Romanic languages can have 50 or more different ways to conjugate one verb. Even most advancedtranslation algorithms have yet to crack the complicated world of conjugations, which is why Smigin decided to forgothem all together.While the lack of verb conjugationis potentially limiting, the goal is that the apps more than 10,000 phrases per language should be enough to support you when traveling abroad, while not sounding like a total tourist.The app currently supports translation in Italian, Portuguese, English, Spanish, and French.The company said more languages are in the works including Swedish, Filipino, German, and Haitian Creole.Smigin now has almost 90,000 downloads across 175 countries, and has raised about $200,000 in seed funding.The new update is available now on the iOS App Store, and the app will be coming to Android soon.
