Another day, another cute dog with a new lease on life thanks to 3D-printed wheels. Today we meet Bubbles, a Dachshund born without front legs. Her owner, Trevor Byers, noticed she was missing her legs when she was in the whelping box and was concerned for her quality of life. However, as she grew, it became clear that little Bubbles could be happy if only she had some sort of wheelchair on which to get around.Enter 3D printing. By creating a little basket and some large wheels, Byers helped Bubbles run with the best of them. He created an Instructable so people can make their own dog wheelchair. He writes:Bubbles has a Facebook page and, as evidenced by the video above, is living the life of Reilly thanks to 3D printing.via 3Dprint
