Political gaffes on Twitter will once again be preserved on the website Politwoops, according to an announcement from Twitter.The company blocked API access for Politwoopsearlier thisyear, a move that apparently crippled the servicesability to archive politicians deleted tweets. A number of open government and human rights groups (and not just the ones operating the various Politwoops sites in different countries) criticized the decision, arguing that a citizens right to information outweighsanofficials right to retroactively edit.Today, Twitter says it has reached an agreement with The Sunlight Foundation (which operates the Politwoops sitein the US) and The Open State Foundation (which first developed the service). It doesnt offer any details about the agreement,, but the gist is that Politwoops is coming back.Politwoops is an important tool for holding our public officials, including candidates and elected or appointed public officials, accountable for the statements they make, and were glad that weve been able to reach an agreement with Twitter to bring it back online both in the US and internationally, said Sunlight Foundation communications director Jenn Topper in a statement.
