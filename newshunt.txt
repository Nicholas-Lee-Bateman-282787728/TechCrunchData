India-based mobilenews aggregation service NewsHunt has raised $40 millionto continue its evolution intoa digital contentplatform.FounderVirendra Gupta told TechCrunch in an interview that the new round is actually a combination of the startups Series A and Series B  both of which were pegged around $20 million. New York-based hedge fund Falcon Edge Capital led the round, with participation from existing investorsMatrix Partners, Sequoia Capital and Omidyar Network.Bangalore-based NewsHuntraised $18 millionback in October 2014, so its had a busy recent period.The NewsHunt service is focused on India, where it is available in 12 languages. It covers over 100 publications and counts 35 million downloads from domestic users, with a further 40 million coming from overseas. Itis also available in Bangladesh, where the company has tie-ins withmedia, and parts of Africa where it works with operators.Gupta explained his beliefthat a focus on local languages is a critical part of making mobile internet adoption nationwide in India. English language literacy is just 10 percent in India, he added.But, to merely focus on the news aggregation side of the business and call it an emerging market version of Flipboard, does NewsHunta great disservice. Thats because it has already ventured out into other kinds of content and services.A ebooks store  introduced in October 2013 has clocked 10 million downloads of content, while iPayy  its carrier billingservice developedin response to Indias low credit card penetration  is open to third party services, through whom it has been used byfour million people.These services are just the start for NewsHunt.Wesee ourselves as the first point of mobile internet for a number of local language users, Gupta said. Weintend to launchvideo, audio [content verticals] and many more things  we want to become a marketplace for local, digital content.That focus makes absolute sense. Much like chat apps in Asia, which are openeddaily byhundreds of millions who communicate with friends on them, NewsHunt is a service thatmany in India turn toeach day. Having gained their attention and engagement, it makes sense that NewsHuntwill offer related products and services which can be accessed around its core news service.Gupta is staying quiet on international expansionat this point, but, having raised money from outside of India and given the international spread of the Indian diaspora, it seems certain thatNewsHuntis cooking up plans.
