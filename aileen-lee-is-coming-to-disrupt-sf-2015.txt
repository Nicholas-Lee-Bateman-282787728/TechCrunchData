Aileen Lee has attracted widespread attention for coining the term unicorn in a November 2013 TechCrunch article about billion-dollar companies. But industry insiders were aware of Lee well before then.A graduate of M.I.T. and Harvard Business School, Lee began her career as a Silicon Valley investor in 1999 when she left her job in brand and product marketing at Gap Inc. to join the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.The position, at that time, was designed to last a couple of years, after which a junior employee like Lee was expected to join an operating company. Instead, Lee waspromoted to a more senior role and eventually made a partner, a role that saw herlead numerous interesting deals, including in the flash-sales site One Kings Lane and the high-end clothing company Rent the Runway.In fact, by 2012, Lee was ready create her own seed-stage fund, Cowboy Ventures. Impressively, she managed to lasso Kleiner as her anchor investor, too. Its looking like a smart move for Kleiner, to which Lee also remains a strategic advisor.Among Cowboy Venturess other promising portfolio companiesareDollar Shave Club; the smart lock company August; and the coffee-shop chainPhilz Coffee.Indeed, given Lees extensiveexperience with nascent startups,were very excited to welcome herback to Disrupt to discusswhats happening at the seed-stage right now  from valuations to signaling risk (anew concern for startups whose seed investors  especially higher-profile investors like Cowboy  dont follow their money into the Series A round).Lee willbe in plenty of great company, too.
