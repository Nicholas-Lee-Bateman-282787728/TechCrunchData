Earlier this year, CoreOS announced Tectonic, its commercial distribution that combines the CoreOS operating system with Kubernetes, Googles container management and orchestration tool. Today, as Kubernetes hits 1.0, the company launched the first preview of this new service.Tectonic subscribers will get 247 support for the whole stack, which, among other things, includes CoreOS, Kubernetes, Docker andflannel (CoreOSs network fabric for containers). Users also get access to a Tectonic dashboard to manage their setup. Tectonic can run both on AWS or in the customers data center. Pricing for this service will start at $1,500 per month during the preview.As CoreOS argues, Tectonic will allow business to focus on their core competencies and still reap the benefits of containers  especially in combination with Quay.io, CoreOSs private Docker registry and container hosting service.In addition to the Tectonic preview, the company also today launched a set of guides for setting up Kubernetes, complete with step-by-step instructions. In addition, CoreOS is partnering with Google and Intel to provide Kubernetes training in a number of select cities later this year.The company will host its first dedicated developer conference for Tectonic in New York in December.For companies that want to get started using Kubernetes and run their applications in the same way Google runs today, CoreOS has the product and support offerings to make you successful, said Alex Polvi, CEO of CoreOS, in a canned statement today.By signing up for the Tectonic preview, using our Kubernetes open source guides or registering for our Kubernetes training courses, CoreOS is helping companies take advantage of the power of containers and transform their application development and deployment processes.
