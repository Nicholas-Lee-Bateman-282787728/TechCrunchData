Its not exactly a Netflix or YouTube rival, butAT&T-backed Fullscreen is hoping to carve out its own niche in the now-crowded subscription video market with its new service, launched this week. The $5 per month offeringincludes a mix of shorter, original content alongside full-length Hollywood movies and TV shows, like Hitch, Dawsons Creek, and Saved by the Bell, for example.At launch, the company says theres over 800 hours of content available for streaming, in an app that works across iPhone, iPad, Android smartphones, Chromecast, and via the web at Fullscreen.com.ContentUnlike YouTube, where the majority ofcontent comes from user-generated videos, Fullscreens original lineup involves severalscripted series, like its reboot of a 1970s TV series, Electra Woman and Dyna Girl, featuringYouTube stars Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart, which focuses on the lives and adventures of two under-appreciated crime fighters.Other shows speak tofamiliar and popular formulas for teen fare.For example, Filthy Preppy Teen$ may appeal to the demographic who watches things like Pretty Little Liars, or the CW network. Making Moves combines the popularity of dance shows and their creative choreography with a scripted series about trying to make it in L.A.Unscripted series include My Selfie Life, plus unfiltered conversations on shows likeShane & Friends, Zall Good with Alexis G. Zall and Kingdom Geek.Meanwhile, nods to teen and millennial culture are rife throughout Fullscreensapp and its videos.For instance, its docu-series called My Selfie Life has an episode featuring a subject who lost 200 pounds via Instagram; #O2LForever follows a YouTube supergroup as they embark on their North American tour; and within the first 5 minutes of Electra Woman, the main characters have dropped pop culture references to both Tumblr and Snapchat.Plus, the app cheekily organizes its contentinto sections whose titles reference the way teen and young adults watch videos today. That is, if theyre not watching a few-minute short piece of content on their mobile, then theyre spending hours bingeing their way through a multi-season series.Fullscreens app almost too-cleverly calls this out, with sections like Ive Got Like 10 Min, Hurry, Make Me Laugh, or Binge On This.Other section titles are also written as if penned by teens who dont give AF.In fact, one featuring dramas is actually calledDark AF. Other sections include Girls Run the World, where youll find everything from Daria to Beyonc, Romance Me, LMFAO, How Dramatic, and more.And if you dont want to browse by section, you can pick a show based on mood by selecting whether you want to snack or binge and then how you want to feel (e.g.laughing till it hurts, getting weird, etc.)Not Just Video, A Social PlatformOne of Fullscreens defining features is itsin-app video player, which offers a buttonthat, when tapped, lets you create GIFs that you can add captions to then share across social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr.This GIF-making function is amazingly simple to use. Its clever too  making and sharing GIFs of TV shows and movies is a popular way that todays young adults socialize around content, and Fullscreen has madethis activity a core part toits streaming service.In addition, a social section in the app lets you follow other peoplesGIFs, where you can flip between streams of the most popular items and those that were just created. You can grab these GIFs, too, and share them with your networks. And you can give them a Facebook-like thumbs up or leave a comment.Like everything else on Fullscreen, the GIFs speak to the young audience on the app with jokes about Coachella, Tinder, internet outages, Becky with the good hair, Uber, texting and finals.Yep, this isnt your moms Netflix over here. And thats the point.According to comments fromFullscreen CEO George Strompolos, the goal with Fullscreen is to function as something like an MTV for todays generation, who grew up watching online video, not traditional TV.If you were to relaunch a network like MTV today, how would you do it? You would probably do it in an over-the-top environment, he said earlier. You would probably do it with the new generation of creators who have captured the hearts and minds of the youth, and you would probably deliver it in a mobile-first experience.Fullscreen is owned by Otter Media, a joint venture between AT&T and Chernin Group, and represents AT&Ts attempt to enter the mobile video market. AT&T will not only help to distribute the app to its subscribers, its also co-producing premium content for the service.That makes Fullscreen a competitor to [TechCrunch parent] Verizons newly launched go90 mobile video service. But the biggest differentiatorhere isthe factthat go90 is ad-supported instead of paid.But similar to AT&Ts strategic partnership with Fullscreen, Verizon has also taken its own stake in rival media network AwesomenessTV to flesh out its own exclusive, original content.Comcast also has its stakes in the streaming market with its mobile-friendly, over-the-top serviceStream, NBCUs comedy-focused SeeSo, and its own YouTube wannabe Watchable.The question now is how many of these niche competitors the market has room for under Netflix, Amazon and YouTubes shadow.At a press event earlier this week, Fullscreen COO Andy Forssell said the company believes it can reach 5 million subscribers, The WSJ reported, but it didnt offer a time frame as to when it expects to meet that goal.
