Talmon Marcothinks he knows what it takes to beat Uber in the on-demand ride sharing business. TheIsraeli entrepreneur, known for co-founding messenger service Viber, is launching Juno in New York City soon.Marco spoke with our own Ingrid Lunden on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, explaining that by giving the drivers half of the companys equity, he believes it will incentivize them to do a better job. The drivers canopt to be either W-2 employees or 1099 contractors, but either way they can get ownership.Whats important is that drivers are not just driving, they also own the business, said Marco. Because were going to treat them properly, theyre going to treat their customers properly, everybodys going to be happy.Juno has already signed up 7500 drivers for its beta program which began in February, insisting that they are holding their work to a higher standard. In order to join Juno, you need a minimum rating of 4.7, said Marco. He said they are already the second-largest ridesharing company in New York by driver count.Hewould not confirm or deny the reported $30 million funding round, but insisted that Juno isvery well-funded. Were not as well-funded as Uber or even as Lyft, but were definitely sufficiently funded.Marco also spoke of his enthusiasm for self-driving cars. Autonomous cars are coming, its just a matter of time.Ultimately, he says that Juno is more than just an Uber competitor. Its a social missionand a business at the same time.
