Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said at the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco today that potential changes in the way its Alibaba spinoff could be taxed would not be an issue as the company continues its proposed spinoff of its Alibaba assets.Yahoo shares fell sharply in May when there were reports that the IRS could change how it might tax spinoffs. That would affect Yahoos planned spin-off of its Alibaba assets.Were proceeding with our plan as proposed, she said. Its based on an understandingof a few key things.I cant presume to speak forthe IRS but given our understanding of that fact pattern, we should proceed with the transaction as planned.In January, when Yahoo said it planned to spin off its Alibaba assets, the process was expected to be essentially tax free. Yahoo shares briefly popped 3 percent after she made the comments at the Bloomberg Tech conference.Throughout Mayers tenure, a significant portion of the excitement around Yahoo among shareholders was its large stake in Alibaba, a company worth $215 billion. Shareholders essentially had been salivating over how the company would handle its stake in the company, which rapidly became worth tens of billions as Alibaba continued to grow and eventually went public.Weve also been reassured this isnt specific to Yahoo, she said.Mayer also said the company is still evaluating itspotential options for Yahoo Japan.I think its too early, she said. Were working with our advisersaround maximizing the value of Yahoo Japan.Those opportunities, thats a thing well communicate with our shareholders in the future. We haventmade a request for aruling there, but a lot has to do with the underlying applicable laws.
