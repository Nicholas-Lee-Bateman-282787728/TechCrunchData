The writing is on the wall for moreconsolidation in the world of startups both literally and figuratively. Today Anoto, a digital writing company based out of Sweden, announced that it would acquire longtime partnerLivescribe, anothera smart pen maker,for $15 million in a deal that is expected to close this month.Specifically, Anoto says this is an all-cash deal and is based upon an enterprise value of $15 million equal to estimated annual sales for 2015.This is a bargain of sorts, buta poor return for investors: Oakland-based Livescribe, founded in 2007, had raised at least $68 million from backers like Qualcomm, Crosslink Capital and Scale Venture Partners.To finance the acquisition, Anoto says that it has signed a placement agreement with Swedens Carnegie Investment Bank AB to issue 158 million shares in Anoto, for a dilution of a maximum of 15%. Anotohas also taken a short-term loan of $2.9 million (25 million Swedish crowns).Livescribe was one of the early leaders in smart pen technology  and by default one of the early movers in the whole area of Internet of Things and turning dumb objects into connected pieces of hardware.But it also faced some significant stumbling blocks. Among them, it lost a trademarkcase in 2013 against UK pay-TV company BSkyB over the use of Sky for one of its WiFi-connected pen models. In turn, theSky wifi smartpen was renamed the more pedestrian wifi smartpen.Livescribe is sellingitsbusiness operations, technology, and intellectual property. The Livescribe brand and existing infrastructure will be retained, with a goal of strengthening the position of both companies through the development and sale of new products, the companies say in a separatejoint statement.By acquiring Livescribe, Anoto is widening the kinds of products its developing and selling.Acquiring Livescribe is another important step in consolidating the Anoto ecosystem and realizing synergies in hardware and software development, supply chain and operations, and sales distribution, said Stein Revelsby, CEO of Anoto, said in a statement. We are already working on a new range of products to be launched in Livescribes sales channels in 2016.The Swedish company has in the past worked to provide digital solutions forany kind of writing, from notes through to interactive displays and large walls. Livescribe is more about developing handheld styluses for smallersurfaces. That narrowed focusmay have beena boost for developing quality, but it perhaps was also one of its problems as a company, considering the large amount competitionin this space, from other startups like Paper to large tech companies like Apple designing itsown native digital pencil.By joining forces with Anoto, we see huge potential for smartpen technology to expand beyond the consumer market and beyond writing and drawing on paper, said Gilles Bouchard, CEO of Livescribe in the same statement. Weve had a successful licensing partnership with Anoto since Livescribe was founded and I am confident that becoming part of Anoto Group will strengthen Livescribes position in the consumer market and allow us to pursue many exciting new opportunities in the years to come.It looks like this is Anotos first acquisition.
