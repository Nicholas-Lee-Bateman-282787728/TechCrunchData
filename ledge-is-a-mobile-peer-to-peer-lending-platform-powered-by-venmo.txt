Launching today with $900K in seed funding, Ledge is an app that lets users easily borrow money from their peers.Everyone knows its hardtolend money to family or friends. The process is awkward, and most people never actually getpaid back.Ledge is trying to fix this issue by bringing automation and transparency to peer-to-peer lending.Heres how Ledge works:After a user decides they needextra cash for something like a cross-country move, they can create a campaign, specify an interest rate and payback period, thenshare it with friends and family.Lenderscan then pledge an amount, and upon being fully funded the campaign will close and after a one-time approval Ledge will automatically use Venmo to transfer money to the borrower, fromall the lenders.Once the loan period starts, Ledge will automatically calculate payments for all lenders,then makemonthly transfersfrom the borrowers Venmo account back to their friends and family.Adam Neff, cofounder of Ledge, explained that this automation eliminates the awkwardness that is traditionally associated with friend and family loans, as all money transfers are handled behind the scenes.Since the platform is powered by Venmo, Ledge doesnt actually touch any money, which allows it to circumvent a plethora of regulations traditionally associated with the lending industry.Ledge launches today and is available on thethe iOS App Store and Google Play Store.
