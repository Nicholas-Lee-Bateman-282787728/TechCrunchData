According to IDC, the global PC markets unit volume slipped 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2015, a slightly larger-than-expected dip. As the company notes, the size of the decline reflects a strong second quarter in the year-ago period, when the death of Windows XP bolstered sales of new machines.In total, some 66.1 million PCs were sold in the three-month period. IDC, its worth remembering, doesnt count handhelds, x86 Servers [or] Tablets as PCs, so all detachable devices that might sport a keyboard are off its lists.Apple performed well in the quarter, seeing its market share rise to a global 7.8 percent, up from 5.9 percent the year before. Of all major PC OEMs, only Apple managed to grow its unit sales in the quarter. That fact mirrors TechCrunchs prior reporting on Apples current PC business.For the rest, it was rough. Heres the chart:IDC expects PC shipments to decline in the single-digit range later this year.Its all eyes on Windows 10 for now. Microsofts uncompleted operating system debuts for the general public starting at the end of this month. Its release is staggered, but even given that fact, Windows 10 is all but released.It isnt hard to argue that, given Windows 10 impending launch, consumers and companies may be holding off on new PC purchases until its release. If that is true, we should see a PC sales bump. There isnt too much historical precedent for such an occurrence.(That Windows XPs death, more than Windows 8s life, sold PCs in the year-ago quarter is oddly funny.)Place your bets in the comments: Will we see a quarter this year during which the PC market expands? Or is it negative growth all the way down?IMAGE BY FLICKR USERDELL INC.UNDERCC BY 2.0LICENSE (IMAGE HAS BEEN CROPPED)
