Israel is racking up agrowing listof startupsthat have either exited to big buyers or gone public, and thistrendis driving yet more investmentinto the country. In the latest development, Tel Aviv VC Singulariteam is announcing that it has closed its second fund $102 million from LPs that include co-foundersof Chinas Tencent and Renren  that it will use to invest in local startups and those with roots back to Israel.It has already made at least six investments out of the latest fund.Singulariteamwas originally founded in 2013 under a different name, Genesis Angels. (It rebrandedto avoid confusion with a similarly-named,older VC in Israel.)Led by entrepreneur Moshe Hogeg he of Mobli and Yo  the original mission was to focus investments into new areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotics.Thats pretty much what the team hasdone.Its first fund of $100 million  which came entirely from entrepreneur Kenges Rakishev plus another unnamed Russian investor was spread across 12 startups that either develop tech directly in these areas (General Robotics, VR eyewear company Meta and Beyond Verbal for example) or use it withinmore generalconsumer applications (such as photo sharing app Mobli,Sprylogics and Yo).The $102 millionfund widened the investment pool from Rakishev to LPs from further afield.Hogeg tells me that the investors out of China came to the fund by way of Mobli. Vic Lee, one of the founders of Tencent, invests in and sits on the board of the startup, and so when it came time to raise the second fund for Singulariteam, Hogeg approached him.Through that, he introduced to to other Tencent and Renren founders, he says. The two things that interested this groupwas the portfolio from the first fund, and the general startup climate inIsrael, Hogeg says. We have the innovation but not the market. China has the market but lacks the innovation.The list of companies that are backed are below. The starred ones are coming out of the latest fund, and well write about them as we learn more.
