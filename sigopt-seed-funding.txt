Y Combinator-incubated SigOpt is announcing that it has raised $2 million in seed funding.The companys aim is to help customers optimize anything, whether its an ad campaign or a formula for shaving cream. In fact, co-founder and CEO Scott Clark (pictured above) told me that his newer customers include Pembient, a bioengineering company that creates synthetic animalmaterials  its using SigOpt to develop a synthetic version of the rhinos horn.The technologys really for anyone testing things on a trial-and-error basis, Clark said. That could be someone in a lab running experiments that take dozens to hundreds of hours, or it could could be in a machine learning setup that requires dozens or hundreds of computer hours.In the case of a physical experiment, youd manually enter both the experiment and the results, then SigOpt could tell you what variation to test next. Clark said it can automatically help you identify the points of highest improvement while balancingbetween the need for exploration (i.e., trying out totally new ideas) and exploitation (drilling down on the areas that are alreadyworking).Clark also argued that SigOpt doesnt compete A/B testing tools  in fact, it offers one-click integration with Optimizely.The seed funding comes from Andreessen Horowitz and Data Collective. Among other things, its allowing SigOpt to hire its first engineers and move into itsfirst San Francisco office.
