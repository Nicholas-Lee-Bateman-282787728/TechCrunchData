OnePlus, the China-based smartphonemaker that sold more than 1.5 million units of its debut device,has finally launched its follow-up: the OnePlus 2.The companys first phonedrew plauditsfor deliveringthe specs and experience thatcompete with some of the best in the industry at a mere $300 price point. The OnePlus 2 is largely cut from the same cloth, with a slightly higher price of $329 for the16GB version, or $389 for a more generous (and powerful) 64GB model, but more for your money. OnePlus is calling it a killer and certainly, with a new iPhone or top-end Samsung device costing $800-plus, the pricing is pretty lethal.The device keeps the same 5.5-inch screen as the original, and this time aroundis powered by a Snapdragon 810 processor from Qualcomm. The camera specs remain the same, too 13 megapixels on the back and 5 megapixels on the front  butnow includes autofocus,Optical Image Stabilization, and an f/2.0 aperture, which improves shots in low light among other things.The devices battery is bumped up to3,300mAh, and the OnePlus 2 includes dual-SIM, a fingerprint scanner and  of course  it runs the companys Oxygen version of Android out of the box. (The OnePlus ran Cyanogen, but  following a legal scrap  OnePlus developed its own OS, which is available as an optional download for the original device.)One of the chief frustrations with the OnePlus was that it could bechallenging to actually buy one. Itrequired getting an invite, which could only be issued by someone who already had one. OnePlus has stuck with that process in order to manage supply, but it has said that it will refine the process to enable more would-be customers to get their hands onthe OnePlus 2. It is creatingphysical booths in parts of the U.S. and Europe where people can try the phone and grab an invite in person.The original device was marketed at consumers outside of China, OnePlus claimed significant growth in India, and thatll be the same focus again with this new phone.Weve not had a chance to review it yet, but the improved camera, fingerprint scanner and 64GB model  which comes with 4GB RAM, as opposed to the 3GB on the 16GB version  make the OnePlus 2appear, on paper at least, to be another promising smartphone at areasonable price.
