Internet kids rejoice!Are you sick of browsing through endless emoji to find the right one? Now Googles smartwatch operating system Android Wear will let you draw a clumsy version of the emoji you want, like a martini glass.

Tap one, and you can instantly send it to a friend.This sweet little featurewas announced today at Googles I/O conference as part of abig update to Android Wear, which included wrist twists to navigate notifications, and black-and-white, low-power mode so you can keep a watch face or app constantly visible on your screen.
