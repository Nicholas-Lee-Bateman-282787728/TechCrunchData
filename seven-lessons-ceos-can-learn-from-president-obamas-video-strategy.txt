But President Obamawas able to leverage the opportunities of digital agetechnologies (such as the Internet, social networks and online video streaming) to become, seemingly, the most engaging, transparent and communicative president the world has ever known, reaching audiences that ordinarily would not be paying attention.CEOs of companies, while dealing with challenges of different scope than that of the president, are in essence trying toachieve similar goals, such as:aligning the masses behind a strategy or an initiative,communicating and explaining decisions to other stakeholders internally or publicly, encouraging individuals to work hard toward common goals, communicating confidently at times of crises,defending strategies and agendas and portraying a positive self-image.Therefore, many CEOs and corporate communications teams could borrow a few best practices from the president, and apply these examples to their corporate communication strategies.The most important part in jump-starting an effective video-centriccommunication strategy isassigning clear ownership with an adequate amount of empowerment and resources to reach video strategy goals.The White House, for example, appointedSilicon Valley veteran Jason Goldman as the first-ever White House Chief Digital Officer, which showcased the emphasis the White House put on digital media for its overall strategy. By emphasizing the importance of video and assigning clear ownershipand resources, the White House has essentially become its own media production company, using cutting-edge technology to advance the presidents agenda, policies and initiatives, such ashealthcare reform.Most enterprise customers assign the video production task to corporatecommunication departments, which are equipped with visionary and expert personnel, appropriate budgets and the backing of the CEO (as well as the IT department) to help them achieve their communication and engagement goals.For previous U.S. presidents it was mostly about working with the traditional media (i.e. news agencies, TVnetworks, newspapers) and occasionally addressing the nation over the TV during the State of the Union, or from the WhiteHouseduring special occasions. Not so for President Obama.Leading up to his last State of the Union address, which was streamed over the Internet, the White House published a series of its own videos  including one video of Obama aboard Air Force One announcing a community college tuition reform plan (8.4million views). Additionally, they used less-traditional video communication, such as a Google Hangout session where Obama was answering questions submitted by regular people at home over video.Such direct video-based communication worked well for Obama. Videos that support initiatives likethe Its On Us pledge (to preventsexual assault on college campuses) and climate change have attracted millions of viewers and pledgers online (one video had more than 42million views on Facebook, making it themost-watched Facebook video ever publishedby a U.S. government or political entity).Similarly, corporatecommunication departments representing the CEO must implement a progressive video strategy that goes beyond streaming quarterly investor relations and downhillpresentations. While these are crucial and must be flawlessly delivered to the global employee base, these are table-stakes for todays modern internal corporate communication strategies.Enterprise video content nowadays often includes everything from live and on-demand video addresses from senior management, to video fireside chats with the CEO or other senior managers (similar to Obamas Google Hangout sessions), to video news flashes about what is happening in the company, informational videos about new product launches, deep-dives into introducing specific departments or projects, video contests, diversity initiatives videos and many more creative projects thatdrive engagement and provide a back wind to the corporate pride and a feeling of beingin the loop.For CEOs specifically, this means using video where it drives the most value, such as promoting initiatives, communicating in crisis situations, showing transparency by sharing information openly and authentically by recording video addresses from anywhere on any topic and connecting with employees on a personal level and recognizing them for their achievements.In 2015 alone, White House officials posted more than 400 videos to YouTube and Vimeo;the videos have been viewed for a total of more than 174,497,605 minutes. The CEOs of America need their own enterprise video portal to engagetheir employees  employees who are increasingly expecting consumer-grade experiences at work.To that end, many leading enterprises deploy internal video portals where allcommunication videos are centrally hosted, accessible by all employees with varying permissions levels, segregated into channels and categories and where all content is easily searchable  which is very similar to the way it is on Vimeo and YouTube, only with the addition of enterprise-grade capabilities such as SSO integration and tight security.Such portals are extremely effective for communication and knowledge sharing, not only for the CEO and senior management, but also for the entire organization, where departments like training, HR, Sales, Finance and ITall have found unique use cases to drive their day-to-day business with video.Obamas digital strategy team is using all social venues possible including YouTube,Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, blogs, etc.to targetspecific messages to specific audiences, while vastly increasing the overallreach.Similarly, as our workforce is becoming increasingly digitally native, senior managers must adapt to the social trends and communicate with employees via social mediums within the organization. Its not just about theaforementioned enterprise video portal; progressive organizations have also been deploying Facebook-like social business software such as Jive, IBM Connections, Yammer, Slack and, most recently, Facebook at Work.These tools provide advanced knowledge sharing capabilities within the social context, while all sensitive content remains behind the firewall. Progressive corporate communications departments are increasingly using these tools to communicate with employees and to create a more transparent corporate culture. When you combine these social tools with video content, you maximize engagement.Social media is all about a two-way conversationpeople share information and their contacts consume it, comment on it, like it, share it and so on. Its no different when it comes to video, but its not only about streaming videos to relevant audiences and soliciting their feedback via comments, shares and likes.It must be a two-wayconversation, whereby your audience can respond via their own videos, by producing low production UGC (user-generated content)videos  these often bring the most value and maximize the effectiveness of many-to-many communication.One example is what the White House did with a video contest  the 2015 White House Student Film Festival on The Impact of Giving Back.Similarly, in the enterprise, it is not only aboutprofessionally produced videos but also about the videos produced using a webcam by the senior managers or by any employee. Great examplesfrom the corporate world are video messages to the team, how-to-videos, white-boarding sessions (here is an example of one of Obamas staff members), video contests, etc.This content is much easier to produce but is significantly more authentic than the professionally produced videos; hence, it becomes theone tail that drives value and scales video communication and knowledge sharing.For example, President Obama encourages not only his own staff to get in front of the camera to talk about policy topics (see Joe Bidens video), but he alsomobilizedseveral YouTube stars to engage their followers with policy-related topics.The key is for CEOs to leverage other influential members of the organization to use video for driving impact and aligning employees behind the CEOs strategies.Obamahumanizedhimself by participating in videos that show him in the day-to-day routines of his position.He essentiallyopened his office to the nation by producing the West Wing Week show  a weekly episode that informs the audience about what is happening in the White House and in the Obama family life.This doesnt meanCEOs should open their personal lives for the entire employee base to watch, but a few videosthat show their personality and authenticity, outside of what employees hear in a quarterly call, cancertainly help establish more trust in the CEO and help employees relate to him/her.Connect with people at apersonal level to become authentic andlikable. Show them what you are like and what yourinterests are. For example:brewing beer in the White Houseor using humor.The U.S. is going to elect a new president this year; it will be interesting to see what digital strategies and video practices the new president will adopt to engage with the masses.But for me it is equally interesting to see how the CEOs of America are increasingly leveraging video technologies to achieve their communication and engagement goals. It is very clear that nowadays you either engage at scale or quickly become irrelevant,as CEOs and other leaders in the business world can no longer afford communicating with their employees via traditional means (quarterly calls, emails and an occasional blog).Instead,they need to put themselves out there by adopting a modern video-based communication strategy  la President Obama.
