The location aware app Foursquare, and its check-in sidekick Swarm, seemingly kills my phones battery. I mean, whenever I get within a block of the TechCrunch office, it lets me know all of the wonderful places around me that I can grab a coffee or whatnot.I even tweeted about how annoying the drain is:Foursquare should pay for my iPhone battery pack. drew olanoff (@drew) December 10, 2015One problem with my annoyance is that Foursquare swears that itsapps dont drain your battery. So much so that they sent me a lovely little poem along with a Foursquare-branded phone charger (which I gave to my wife). I thought it was a pretty cool way to handle a gripe that they probably get often:So heres my official apology, Foursquare.Just stick to your day jobs and well do the writing ;)
