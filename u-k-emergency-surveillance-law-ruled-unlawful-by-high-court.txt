In a high profilewin for civil liberties in the U.K., surveillance legislation rushed through the nationalparliament in a matter of days lastyear has today been declared unlawful under European Human Rights law.Two MPs, Tom Watson (Labour) and David Davis (Conservative), along withcivil rights campaign group Liberty,took the government to the High Court lastmonth, challengingthe Data Retention and InvestigatoryPowers Act (DRIPA) on privacy and data protection grounds. Today the High Court agreed with their challenge.Court overturns #DRIPA. We won the case! tom_watson (@tom_watson) July 17, 2015The government can appeal thejudgement  and does not have to instantly halt data retention practices taking place under DRIPA, with the courtallowing those portions of the law it deems unlawful to remain in force until March 2016 to allow time for the government to legislate properly.But the ruling fires a clear warning shot across the bows of a government that is among themost hawkish in Europe on surveillance and interception  with the U.K. Prime Minister at times appearing to suggest encryption should be outlawed, and a Home Secretary whohas consistently bangedthe drum to ramp upinvestigatory powers.DRIPA as a whole has a sunset clause of the end-of-2016. So the government isalready workingto replace it with permanent and potentially more expansive surveillance legislation (it has talked ofplugging capability gaps) viathe forthcoming Investigatory Powers Bill(IPB)  the latter due in draft form this fall.Todays High Court ruling will feed into the debate as MPs seekconsensus onwhere the line should be drawn to balancestate surveillancecapabilities with individual privacy rights. And indicates thatthe governments current thinking is out of step with EUlaw. (NB: the governments election manifesto included a pledge to replace the European Convention on Human Rights with a British Bill of Rights  although it has not announced any legislative timetable for doing so yet).One area where there iscross-party  and wider  consensusis the need for clarity in theoversight legislation whichgoverns state surveillance, interception and data retention powers in the U.K. The existing Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act is roundly condemned as unfit for purpose. And legislatingto provide for appropriate oversightis one of the governments stated intentionswiththe forthcoming IPB.DRIPA, meanwhile, isanythingbut clear orappropriate. The legislationwas criticized last yearfor being overly vague and draconian, as well as for going against the wider regionaltrajectory by effectively reversing the European Court of Justice ruling that had, months earlier, struck down EUdata retention powers as disproportionate.Discussing DRIPA withTechCrunch last year former Pinsent Mason lawyerDanvers Baillieu noted howfew limits itafforded on thescope ofretention notices that the Home Secretary could issue.Basically clause 1 says the Secretary of State may issue a retention noticeand it may require just about anything  including the retention notice may make different provision for different purposes, thats what it says in the bill. So a retention notice can pretty much tell you to do anything  other than hold anything longer than 12 months, he said.The High Court evidentlyagrees with Baillieus assessment, ruling thatsection 1 isunlawful on the grounds that itfails to provide clear and precise rules to ensure data is only accessed for the purpose of preventing, detecting or conducting criminal prosecutions of serious offences. The court also ruled section 2 unlawful because itdoes not build in limits to accessing this data by requiringaccess beauthorized by a court or independent body.The latter point is interesting because two government commissioned independent reviews of surveillance legislation, which have both published their findings this summer, have called for intercept warrants to be signed off by the judiciary, rather than being sanctioned by ministers  as is the case now.The government has so far said it has not yet made a decision on that point, although some of the noises coming out of Downing Street appear to suggest Cameron is not keen on the idea. Todays High Court ruling piles more pressure on the government to bend to a growing number of calls that warrants be authorized by judges, not senior politicians.On the independent approvalpoint, the High Court notes in its ruling:The need for that approval to be by a judge or official wholly independent of the force or body making the application should not, provided the person responsible is properly trained or experienced, be particularly cumbersome.Another criticism of DRIPA isthe governments unseemly haste in railroading the billthrough parliament, bypassing the normal lengthy legislative scrutiny process by gaining the support of the opposition Labour party to ensure a majority, and by using a tactic of putting the law through as parliament was about to go on summer recess. All of which was widelycondemned at the time as un-democractic.With theHigh Court slammingDRIPA as unlawful now thegovernment will also be under pressure to avoid any such unseemly hastein future surveillance debates as it works to reshape legislation in this area.That said, DRIPAs sunset clause already puts in place a fairly short windowfor detailed parliamentary scrutiny of such a technologically complex area (not to mention the moral and ethiccomplexities arising atthe intersection of individual rights andstate responsibilities).The High Court ruling now squeezes the governments timetable further by sunsettingsome ofDRIPAs powers several months earlier.Albeit,to spin all that another wayGovernment have nine months to bring back new legislation. MPs were given one day to discuss the legislation last year. tom_watson (@tom_watson) July 17, 2015The Home Secretary has previously saidthe government is committing to having a IBPbyearly next year to allow time for it to pass into law before the DRIPA sunset clause comes into effect at the end of 2016.In order to meet that timetable and allow thorough parliamentary scrutiny we intend to bring forward a draft bill for consideration in the autumn, which will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, including by a joint committee of both Houses, she said last month.Responding to todays High Court judgement, David Anderson, the QC who penned one of the two independent reviews of government surveillance legislation, notesitmay affect the timing of the governments plans for wide-ranging reform in this area shouldthe government decide it needsremedial legislation before March 2016. Which suggests the IPBs timetable could be set back if the government focuses on another stop-gaplegislative patch.The prospect of the government rushing through morehasty surveillance legislation is not good. Nor is the prospect of truncated parliamentary scrutiny of new surveillance oversight law when the overwhelmingrequirement here isfor clear and precise guidance. Problematically vagueexistinglegislation has undoubtedly contributed toserious privacy and civil liberties breaches by state operators for years. We dont need any more RIPAs.Anderson dubs todayscourt rulinga decision of great potential importance, noting that it echoes decisions already made by national courts in the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Slovenia and Romania  falling in line with EUlaw.Hewrites:If not successfully appealed,the judgmentwill require change to existing practices for accessing communications data (which I had already recommendedshould besubject insome categories of case to a higher degree of independent authorisation: see A Question of Trust, Recommendations 65,67-71). Indeedit may point tobroader-reachingchange than I had recommended, speaking of the need for approval in all cases by a judge or official wholly independent of the force or body making the application (Judgment, para 98). This throws into doubt the adequacy of the existing system for approval and authorisation by a designated person within the police force or public authority which seeks communications data. Some of the practical constraints in this area are illustrated at 9.24(a)(b) of A Question of Trust.Thejudgment may also be of relevance to the current debate over whether there should be judicial or ministerial authorisation of interception warrants (which were not the subject of the Davis/Watson case, but which relate to the content of communications and may thus be considered more intrusive than the communications data at stake in that case). Change in this respect was recommended both in A Question of Trust (Recommendation 22), andin this weeks RUSI report, A Democratic Licence to Operate. My reflections on this point in A Question of Trust, 5.79, were reproduced by the Divisional Court at para 72 of its judgment.He alsoadds thatthe ruling is of no direct relevance to the so-called Snoopers Charter  another piece of surveillance legislation which the government tried and failed to pass last year, and which would have expanded the categories of data retained by ISPs  but he reiterates, in line with recommendations from his recent surveillance review report,that it underline[s] the need fora legally sound andevidence-based case, if this idea is to be pursued in the future.Withthe Snowden revelations of 2013 unmasking thehuge scaleand scope of state digital surveillance apparatus, creating an imperative forreform and clearer oversight,its to be hopedthat a U.K. law as opaque and problematic as RIPA could no longer be passed  and thatdomestic politiciansheed growing calls forlegally sound and evidence-based investigatory powers that do not infringe human rights.Or, as Eduardo Ustaran, Partner at law firm Hogan Lovellswrites, todays High Court ruling is a sign of the need for democratic diligence in the political decision-making process  and signals the need foran open and public debate that leads to a thorough legislative process without hyperbole and paranoia in order to deliver a legal framework that stands up to the courts scrutiny.
