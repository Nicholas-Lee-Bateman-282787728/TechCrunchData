While a lot of the US was out and about shopping for themselves or others for the holidays, Cards Against Humanity ran their own Black Friday campaign, asking for $5 and in return the buyer would get nothing.Nada.Zip.And the buyers (all 11,248 of them) LIKED it.Today, the team shared that theyd made a grand total of $71,145 in one day and let us in on what they would be buying with their hard-earned cash. Lets call it an early holiday bonus for the team:This year we offered our customers the ultimate Black Friday experience  the ability to buy nothing from us for $5. We took our entire store offline, and put up a simple payment form where people could give us $5.11,248 people gave us $5, and 1,199 people gave us more than $5 by filling out the form more than once. One enthusiastic fan gave us $100. In the end, we made a windfall profit of $71,145.Cards Against Humanity is known for our charitable fundraising  since 2012 weve raised nearly $4 million for organizations we love like Worldbuilders, the Sunlight Foundation, the EFF, DonorsChoose.org, the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Chicago Design Museum. We even started a $500,000 full-ride scholarship for women getting degrees in science.Theres been a lot of speculation about how we would spend the money from Black Friday, and were happy to announce that this time, we kept it all. Heres what we bought.

This is certainly not the first time charitable giving played a role in their efforts. Heres my favorite purchase:Our cats poop a lot, too. Read the full list of what they snagged here.
