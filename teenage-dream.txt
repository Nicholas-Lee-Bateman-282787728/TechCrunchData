Over 500K. To kick off the new year, University of Texas at Austin sophomore and actual teenAndrew Watts decided to write an essay about his thoughts on social apps, which was meant just for himself and his friends and maybe their friends to read.He put it up on Mediums Backchannel, on one of the social apps he wrote about, and the post blew up  and even received some backlash. Eleven days later, he found himself on a plane to SF, flown out on Aols dime, to talk to us about all things apps, what he wants to be when he grows up, and what he thinks about Foursquare in one word (dead).Screw teens, I wanna know what apps infants like and are using these days.
