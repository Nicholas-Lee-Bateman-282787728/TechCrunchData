Start-Up Chile SCALE, the follow-on fund backed by the Chilean government to boost local startup growth, is making its first nine investments.The nine companies, all graduates of Start-Up Chiles past three classes, will receive $100K each in equity-free funding. In exchange, the founders agree tokeep their companiesin Chile for at least a year and serve as mentors to three Chilean startupswhile theyre there.Sebastian Vidal, director of Start-Up Chile, calls this social equity.In Latin America theres a lack of experts  you can count on your fingers the success stories that we have, says Vidal. So the solution, for now, is recruitingexternal talent to jump-start the local tech ecosystem through the accelerator, and provide incentives for entrepreneurs tostay in Chile afterthe program ends.The $100K in free money isnt the only reason that the founders of these nine startups are choosingChile overSilicon Valley.Bureo, for instance, is building skateboards out of recycled fish nets, which make up 10 percent of plastic waste in the ocean, according to co-founder David Stover. Theyre currently working with six fishing ports on the Chilean coastline and theyve turned 10 tons of recycled fishing nets into skateboards since they started in 2013.Chile has a very robust fishing industry. We found a reputable recycler and qualified manufacturer in Santiago, so now were collecting materials and running a program thats fully operational in Chile, says Stover.Bureo recently raised additional seed funding from Patagonias 20 Million & Change fund that backs for-profit entities solving environmental crises. Stover says Bureo brought its first boards to market in December 2014, and the company is already turning a profit.According to Vidal, revenue was a prerequisite for all of the companies selected for the follow-on grant.We want to make sure that the business model is already validated, because in Latin America, a company with traction but no revenue in the first year is not considered successful  here, those companies will not get fundingand they will die unless theygo to the States, says Vidal.For thefounders of themidgame, a social media marketing startup, relocatingto the U.S.is not an option at all. Colombian foundersCarlos Saavedra and Andrs Felipe Diaz recentlygraduatedfromY Combinators Winter 2015 class but had to leave the country whentheir businessvisas expired.For us its an option to work from Chile while we sort out our visa problems, says Saavedra, but adds that heplans to keep a permanent engineering hubin Chile because local developers costabout a third of Silicon Valleys going rate.Here are all nine companies selected for the SCALEgrant:
