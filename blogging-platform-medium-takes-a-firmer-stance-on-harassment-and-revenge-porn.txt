Its time to clean up the Internet, apparently. Blogging platform Medium this weekjoined Google and Microsoft, as well as other social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, and more recently Reddit, in taking a firmer stance on how it will handle online harassment, including the posting of confidential and personal information and revenge porn.According to new rules posted on the Medium website, the company says it now reserves the right to suspend or block accounts and remove offensive content without notice and at its sole discretion.Explains the company in a post about the updated policy:Every online social platform has to come to terms with the tension between fostering free expression (Say anything!) and creating a place where everyone is free to be who they are (You are welcome here!). Somewhere on this spectrum, sooner or later, you have to land. Where you land says a lot about what kind of online space you want to be.The new rules address a variety of online abuses, includingthreats of violence, hateful slurs, bullying, public shaming, blackmail and the posting of private or explicit images, taken or shared without the subjects explicit consent. This latter item is known more commonly as revenge porn, and has been the target of a number of policy changes affecting larger platforms, including Google, Bing and Facebook, to name a few.Just days ago, in fact, Bing introduced a new online form that will allow users to request the removal of revenge porn links from the Bing search engines index. The move followed a similar announcement from Google last month, whichsaid it was making a web form available that people can use for their revenge porn takedown requests.Though operating at a much smaller scale than something like Google or Facebook, Mediums stance on the matter of harassment, trolling and revenge porn is relevant in the grand scheme of things,as more companies today are taking a harder line with how theyre dealing with disruptive and offensive content on their platforms.While anonymous postings from those who hide behind a username can help fuel the popularity of online services (see for example, Yik Yaks climb up the App Store charts as a sort of modern-age slambook for school kids and college students) not having to publicly stand behind your words can also lead people to say and do pretty terrible things.Though theres still a need to allow people the protections of anonymity for a variety of reasons, ranging from users simple right to privacy to protection from authoritarian regimes who crack down on dissidents social media postings, its becoming clear that there do need to be more established boundaries in place for many of the webs mostpopular services.The fallout that comes fromhosting offensive contentwas also evident on Reddit this year,as its seedy underbelly featuringsome of Internets most horrible and offensive posts finally came into conflict with the companys desire to run a real business that caters to advertisers. The company claims thatreason didnt come into play when the site updated its content policies, but that seems disingenuous.Like everyone else competing in the social space, Reddit came to understand that completely unfettered free speech, as newCEO Steve Huffman put it, ultimately harms a community and silences others. That can limit growth, and can serve to create a fickle community thatwill ultimately abandon your platform for the next one that allows them to troll unabated.It should also be noted that, in many cases, the victims of online harassment and especially revenge porn, are women  a demographic thats still woefully underrepresented behind-the-scenes, staffing the ranks of some of the tech industrys largest companies, including those who have turned a blind eye to online harassment and revenge porn for years.Perhaps Medium, which wasfounded by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams, doesnt want to head down the same troubled path as others, including Twitter itself,have traveled over the years,when it comesto how bullying and harassment is handled on its platform.Though inrecent months, Twitter has begun addressing the problem with the release of tools for handling and reporting abuse, internally, the company admitted to failing its users with regard to how it handled the problem of trolls and their harassing messages. (A leaked memo from then-CEO Dick Costolo even stated that weve sucked at it for years.)With its new content policy, Medium is setting the tone for the community it wants to foster on its site, while also addingthat it wont blindly react to incoming complaints. The company says that it wants to apply its new rules thoughtfully, which may mean asking for explanations about issues so it can understand the wider context.The bigger problem ahead for Medium, and all companies today, is where to draw the line. As a blogging platform that ultimately wants to lend itself to passionate and evencontroversial op-eds, it will have to be careful about when and how it acts going forward.
