The ACLUon Monday released a survey that found 60 percent of American voterswant to see modifications to the PATRIOT Act, the post 9/11 law that created the nations modern intelligence apparatus. The polling comes asthe Republican leadership attempts to haltsurveillance reform in the Senate.The debate is becomingincreasingly politicized in Congress, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calls for clean reauthorization of a PATRIOT Act provision set to expire on June 1, Section 215. This section provided the mandate for the controversial bulk collection of American phone records revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden almost two years ago.The House passed a bill that would reform parts of the PatriotAct last week, but a spokesperson forthe ACLU criticized that portion for notgoing far enough.From Snowdens revelations, we know the government uses other laws  notably Section 702 and Executive Order 1233  to collect Americans communications. This reform would only affect the bulk collection occurring under the Patriot Act.As other organizations like Pew have found, the survey shows that calls for reform are bipartisan. Fifty-nine percent of Democrats surveyed and 58 percent of Republicans surveyed strongly agreed with modifying the law. That percentageonly rose among independents, with 71 percent supporting reform efforts.In a media call, ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani said thesefindings highlight the disconnect between lawmakers on the Hill and the American people.In order to be more reflective of publics views on surveillance and the PatriotAct, members of Congress should more fully support reforms and can fullysupport more aggressive reforms, she said.The ACLU also noted that surveillance reform could become a key issue during the primaries, especially because voters on the far right and far left are more likely than moderates to support reform efforts. The ACLU saidthat with the bipartisan support for reform and even greater support among independents, surveillance reform is an issue that could consistently help candidates appeal to voters no matter their political affiliation.As weve seen with past surveys, younger voters were more likely than older voters to support modifying the PatriotAct. Sixty-five percent of 18- to 39-year-olds support reform, as compared to only 59 percent of voters over the age of 45.The overwhelming majority of respondents  82 percent  said they were concerned about the government collecting and storing their information. When given specific examples of government surveillance,respondents were most likely to be concerned about the government accessing their personal records without a judges permission or collecting information without a warrant for purposes other than stopping terrorist attacks.This survey of about 1,000 likely American voters comes as the future of surveillance reform remains uncertain in Washington.Although the reform bill sailed through with a large majority in the House, Senate Republicans seem intent on lining up with McConnell and calling for a clean reauthorization.But privacy advocates on both sides of the aisle say they will filibuster any legislation that reauthorizes the program.With the clock ticking, lawmakers will have to break this stalemate quickly or risk letting the PATRIOT Act provision expire,and with it the most controversial of the NSA programs.
