Publisher tools and paywall companyPiano is announcing a new tool that could give publishers more freedom to experiment with paywalls and other business models.The company was created last year from the merger of Tinypass and Piano Media. While the combined organizationcontinues to offer a paywall system for publishers, CEO Trevor Kaufman has said that the issue isno longer a black-and-white  publishers should make money from different users in different ways.The new Composer tool seems like a direct extension of that idea, offeringa drag-and-drop interface where publisherscan create different rules that tailor the reader experience to different audience segments.So based on things like a users device, location, value to advertisers and use of ad blockers, a publisher can present them with different kinds of subscription offers and/or restrict their access after theyve read or watched a certain amount of content.[The paywall product] is still a lot of our bread and butter, but what we found in that process is that clients didnt have a good way to deploy lots of business models and communications and segmentation in an agile way, Kaufman told me.So with Composer, whether a publisher want to run lots of different experiments or just teak the pricing, they can do so without turning it into a big IT project.The Piano team is working to improve Composers audience targeting by integrating with data sources like Bluekai. Its also usable by publishers who dont want to get rid of their existing, non-Piano/Tinypass paywall systems.And while Piano is only officially launching Composer today,Kaufman said its alreadyoutselling the companyspaywall product.
