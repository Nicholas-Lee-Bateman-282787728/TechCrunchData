There are endless combinations and the ability to customize by dimension is something that is usually found at the very high-end of the scale.The company is about to open a brand new flagship retail space in Chicago, where Interior Define is based, with plans to launch brick-and-mortar locations in other cities soon.In March, Interior Define snagged Crate & Barrel president Marta Calle as the executive chair of the board.Interior Define says its growing 20 percent month-over-month in sales.If you want to check out the new 3D visualizer, head over to the website here.
