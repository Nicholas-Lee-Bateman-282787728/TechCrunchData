Microsoft PowerApps allows anybody to build basic businessapps without having to touch any code. These apps can run on the web and on mobile (through the PowerApps apps for iOS and Android). Microsoft first announced a private preview of this project last Novemberbut starting today, its open for anybody who wants to give it a try.Building apps in PowerApps is mostly a drag-and-drop affair. While the serviceoffers an online dashboard, the design workhappens in a Windows 10 desktopapp.Most line-of-business apps rely on being able to connect to a variety data sources. Thankfully, Microsoft makes it easy to connect to both its own tools like Excel, Office 365, SharePoint Online, OneDrive and Dynamics CRM, but also to third-party tools like Google Drive, Salesforce, Dropbox, Slack and Twitter. Ifyou rely on aservice that isnt integrated into PowerApps yet, you can also connect your apps toanyRESTful API.To get new users situated, Microsoft offers a number of templates fora couple of standard use cases. For the most part, though, building new apps from scratch is pretty straightforward  though maybe not quite as trivial as Microsofts marketing wants to make it look.PowerApps also includes some basic integration with Microsoft Flow  anIFTTT-like service for connecting apps that dont usually talk to each other the company quietly released earlier this week.Thanks to this, you can trigger Flow actions from your PowerApps apps, for example.Flow, for the most part, gives you a bit more flexibility in how you want to trigger actions than similar tools like IFTTT and Zapier do, but for the time being, it doesnt offer anywhere near the amount of services you can connect with each other. Unsurprisingly, Flows focus is more on business tools like Office 365, Dynamics CRM, Yammer, MailChimp, Slack, GitHub and SalesForce, but it also supports a few standard Facebook and Twitter actions.
